Normal place to eat. 
 perfect place to go if you need something quick and good. 
This place is so close that you could grab a sandwich quick before going to Disneyland to take it in and enjoy or after you leave the park. 
Good place to get a sub and back to your hotel and eat or take it into disney. 
 Perfect place to eat when you don't want to eat a heavy meal.

 There wasn't enough places for people to sit down.

This place is 24 hours which is great. Service can be a hit or miss depending on what time you go and who is helping you
Good place, I go there at least a few times a week. I like their soup too (i know, subway soup). They make subs good!
I go here almost every friday for the Tuna deal they have. Its the closest from my work and easy to deal with since you can order through the app. Most times ive picked up through the app there were things off about the sandwich (ill get extra ingredients or things are missing, the directions werent followed as closely etc). Today, Jasmine did my order, and it was a great sandwich. Her attention to detail was on spot and she even wrapped my sandwich twice without requesting (never even thought of that. I always have a problem with the juices leaking over time). In general this place is pretty good and their indoor facility is clean and usually quick when they are a little busy. I dont expect perfection with the app orders most times anyway but Jasmine really went above and beyond today. 
A good place.When all ingredients were in place I asked for the Sweet Onion sauce and for a little on each half of the sandwich. 
It's an ok place. 
 not enough for me to write off the place though. 
  I have more horror stories from this place . 
 this place is amazing. 
The real star of this place is the soda machine. 
We order sandwiches for dinner to take into Disneyland. 
Everyday during our Disney vacation we'd head back the hotel for a break and get some lunch at the nearby Subway. 
 This is a typical Subway that offers great alternative to over price food in the park. 
We were visiting Disneyland for 3 days and looking for an inexpensive dinner option before we headed back to the park. 
 Greek food and Chinese food. 
 good sandwiches and good prices make this a great place for a quick lunch. 
We bought lunch here before leaving to drive back home from Disneyland. 
 The hotel had a brochure with a buy one 6 inch sub with a drink and get a 6 inch sub free. 
 I did this twice and the food was great and service. 
I stopped here for dinner one night after a long day in the Disney park. 
We popped by this subway a couple of times on our trip and the food lives up to the subway standard. 
Grabbed lunch here and the manager and staff were really friendly. 
 Subway had food that was tasty and clean whereas StarBurger next door served me a burger that came back up that night. 
Instead of eating expensive food at Disneyland. 
same food and same subs that we order back home in canada. 
 food is consistent. 
Had breakfast and supper here a few times while visiting Disney. 
 Friendly staff and good food at reasonable prices. 
25) from here for a fast and easy lunch when visiting Anaheim for the NAMM Show. 
I went here for lunch one day. 
When we were just looking for a quick snack and wanted food that we could depend on. 
We just wanted something that was somewhat healthy and an alternative to fast food. 
 The Ranch dressing tasted &quot. 
 The chicken tasted old and the lettuce was wilted. 
 Service and food were good. 
 The food was fresh and good. 
for a simple healthy food. 
 Subway was our daily stop for lunch. 
 Disneyland park food just does not have healthy choice at an affordable price
We often stop here to get lunch before heading to Disneyland or California Adventure for the day. 
 Food is just like every other Subway. 
Reliable and inexpensive for Dinner. 
We enjoyed our dinner and free cookies for completing the survey on line. 
 worth the walk if you are tired of overpriced junkfood. 
 Subway food quality. 
A nice lunch break from the park. 
Had lunch here one day and it was so nice to eat a sandwich. 
This subway was excellent it saw 24 hours open just across our hotel desert Palm hotels the service was fantastic food was great
 and so we enjoyed our dinner in our room. 
The food in subway is fresh. 
 and I bought breakfast sandwiches there instead of the expensive hotel breakfast
 either brunch before we entered the park or a late lunch around 3pm after leaving the park. 
 The food was always good and the service (once we hot used to the American way of doing things and the different menu) was always. 
Awesome for cheap and quick breakfast before heading to Disneyland. 
 pack a lunch and save money. 
After spending too much for breakfast at the hotel. 
 This was my first time having Subway for breakfast. 
 so food was as expected. 
Subway is my top choice for quick fast food. 
Great sandwiches and drinks. 
 We took our food out. 
 don't expect much to choose from particularly warm food. 
 so it's probably a good idea to plan to take your food with you. 
 This is a great alternative to Disney food - fresh and at a reasonable price. 
Friendly service and fresh food.

I'm a coffee drinker, they make it fresh when I buy a meal,  even late at night."
 and I seriously hope that this owner learns to take food safety more seriously. 
 has a great fountain drink dispenser. 
I'm still not a fan of the 101 flavor soda machine (every time I use it my soda always seems to have a lingering taste of whatever the person before me had). 
 I'm usually friendly and polite to whoever's making my sandwich (they do have control of my food. 
 and almost like fast food. 
 and pick from about a bajillion drinks. 
 and crazy Coke drinks. 
) I got honey mustard sauce (my usual) on one of my sandwiches and it tasted extremely sour. 
  I come back to the cashier and tell her I think the honey mustard is expired and that it tastes very sour. 
  She says "that's how honey mustard is supposed to taste" with a look on her face like I'm an idiot. 
2 the sandwich I'm really regretting not doing so cause it tastes like shit with the salt. 
 Great service. 
 Staff at Subway was friendly and fast. 
Attentive staff. 
We have 4 kids and the staff was very patient and efficient when the kids ordered their sandwiches.

This is by far the best subway around. Always friendly and fast service, plus fresh ingredients!
Staff was great. 
I feel bad for the staff. 
 the service is ok. 
Polite staff - and they work quickly to move the line if there is one. 
 we didn't have any trouble with the employees so that's always a good thing because customer service is the most important thing to me. 
 and decent service - Ill keep this location as my "go-to" subway. 
Service is inconsistent here. 
 I feel like every time I come in (3x a week minimum) there's new staff. 
The two employees that were working at the store this evening were NOT customer service oriented and really made the entire experience awkward. 
 Usually I get great customer service from this store. 
 the service I received this evening and the lack luster quality of the sandwich has left a negative experience on my mind. 
 I have worked in the customer service and hospitality industry for 10 years and the service I received this evening really was horrendous. 
I have already sent this complaint into Subway via their customer service form: http:.

 Classic subway selection and classic price
 We ate there a few times for a cost effective alternative to Disney
 inexpensive meal. 
Instead of eating expensive food at Disneyland. 
 the prices are a bit lower in the usa. 
 with our currency so weak it probably worked out to the same price. 
 Friendly staff and good food at reasonable prices. 
 and for a little extra cost. 
 though higher priced than a usual Subway. 
 Can't go wrong for the price. 
 Decent prices. 
 Prices are great. 
 Disneyland park food just does not have healthy choice at an affordable price
 the price can't be beat.

 Super expensive. 
 The prices were reasonable and the sandwich was better than I expected. 
 This is a great alternative to Disney food - fresh and at a reasonable price. 
 Prices here are also very reasonable considering the cost of eating at Disney restaurants. 
 Good price.
