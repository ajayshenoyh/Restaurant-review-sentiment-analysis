Very lively and nice atmosphere inside and friendly staff.
They lack the energy to serve the best burrito
Went here with a group of friends and saw that the place was good for groups . Very lively and nice atmosphere inside and friendly staff. The food was still sizzling when it came out and the fajitas we ordered were very tasty! All the ingredients were fresh and had great flavor. Would definitely recommend to anyone and will be back !
Nice seating arrangement. Good food .better views.
I always enjoy the white people spin on burritos. Everyone stared at me when I yelled I love this place. 
Delicious food, the best place to minus your hunger. Super fast service.
Delicious food, great atmosphere. Great service. 
My friends and I would always come here after class. Depending on what time it is, the wait could be long
Busy location but fast service. Seating are was clean. 
They are usually busy but they care to listen to what you need and make your food the way they should! i have been going there for the past 3 years and absolutely love this location. plenty of sitting also!
It's a few minutes after 11am, which means they just opened and there's already a line..it's moving rather quickly. I'm ordering in three minutes. Meat serving is decent, the lettuce looks a little dry. Service is average, looks clean. Will come back.
