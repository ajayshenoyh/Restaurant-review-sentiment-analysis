I didn't ever think I would find a sandwich shop that could compete with my ccurrent favorite place. Well,  I think I found its competitor.  Jersey Mike,  if your bread was alittle more crunchy. I give you a 9 out of 10. Very delicious sandwiches though. Definitely coming back !!!
A little bit more costly then subway, but you get more meat then at subway, so I guess it evens out. The bread is good too, would recommend the roast beef and provolone on wheat. Ask for Mike's way if you like Italian inspired flavor to come through on your sandwich. Never too busy and the place is always well kept and clean. Phone in orders if you're on the go
I really enjoyed the quality of food, and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. There wasn't a long wait, and the place seemed pretty clean. It's very exlensive, but here I believe that you do get what you pay for.
Staff is super professional and friendly.  They really seem to care about making the best sub possible and providing a satisfying experience.  My favorite sub shop.
Loved the food there.
Great subs and lots of options to choose from
Mike's style is terrible, the sandwich person wouldn't stop drenching my sandwich in oil and vinegar after repeated statements of that's enough.
