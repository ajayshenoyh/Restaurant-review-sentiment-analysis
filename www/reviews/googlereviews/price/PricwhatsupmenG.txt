I love this place. It has good ramen and the service and prices are fair. Come in during lunch for lunch special. 
Ramen that will blow your mind and they are open late. Everything is delicious and prices are great.Love coming here with friends when I'm near Cal State.
Their seared pork is absolutely amazing and I order it every time. Quick service and attentive staff. Very reasonably priced!
