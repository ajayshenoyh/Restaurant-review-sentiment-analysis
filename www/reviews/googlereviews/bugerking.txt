Had a great dine-in experience. The fries were hot and crispy. The way I like it
It's close to my job making it great when I need to grab a quick bit to eat.
Good fast food, good prices and good choice in combos. Need to be more clean and organized.
I was two cents short and the young lady gave me real nasty attitude,  if such a problem for them then don't work in fast food.  The food was O. K. and I would go back again.  The fries were fresh after they gave me a small fry instead of the large I ordered, so they had to cook more! So besides the bad customer service by the one female,  it was O. K. 
Very good service. Otherwise, a regular BK.
The food is okay but if you get something from the doller menu , it feels like your getting nothing , it doesn't fill you up like McDonalds. But the ice coffee is really good and I've went back for seconds. Better then Starbucks and cheaper.
(Low with staff as well)
Purchase BF on Sun. morning and most of meat & harsh Browns are cold & leftover ! Chocolate milk expired 3weeks. Very poor management, Won't back again. 
Helpful?
I love burger king its my all time favorite restraunt you should
It's nothing more , nothing less. 

Although at certain hours, services can be lacking due to short of staff.
