Good fast food, good prices and good choice in combos. Need to be more clean and organized.
I was two cents short and the young lady gave me real nasty attitude,  if such a problem for them then don't work in fast food.  The food was O. K. and I would go back again.  The fries were fresh after they gave me a small fry instead of the large I ordered, so they had to cook more! So besides the bad customer service by the one female,  it was O. K. 
The food is okay but if you get something from the doller menu , it feels like your getting nothing , it doesn't fill you up like McDonalds. But the ice coffee is really good and I've went back for seconds. Better then Starbucks and cheaper.
Usually very crowded and doesn't allow drinks refills.
Not too bad, the employees actually fill up your drink to the very top and are very quick 
Pleasure for taste buds.Usually very crowded and doesn't allow drinks refills.

Pleasure for taste buds.Went here with a group of friends and saw that the place was good for groups . Very lively and nice atmosphere inside and friendly staff. The food was still sizzling when it came out and the fajitas we ordered were very tasty! All the ingredients were fresh and had great flavor. Would definitely recommend to anyone and will be back !
Nice seating arrangement. Good food .better views.
Delicious food, the best place to minus your hunger. Super fast service.
Delicious food, great atmosphere. Great service. 
They are usually busy but they care to listen to what you need and make your food the way they should! i have been going there for the past 3 years and absolutely love this location. plenty of sitting also!
Great Indian food at a good price and very fast service. I can be in and out in less than 5 min.
The food is decent, but somehow not as flavorful as the Indian food I'm used to. Service is quick and friendly, and the selection is familiar if not extensive - they seem to carry between 8 and 12 dishes at any given time. 
You can dine and take out food...its a cafeteria type place so service is a bit faster......
Love the big portions and the taste is great. One of our favorite spots for Indian food near us.
Awesome Indian food bit spicy though.. good thing is they let you taste the curry before ordering.
Great food and friendly service
If you like indian food, give this place a try. Affordable and authentic 
The restaurant is small and thus not very conducive to dining in, but the food is very tasty! I absolutely love getting the Chicken Tikka Masala combo with garlic naan.
Although the selections are severely limited, each dish is very delicious. I particularly enjoy the curry goat. They also give you a lot of food per order, filling the entire carryout foam box. For the price,  it is superb value. 
ice food...but the sunday morning staff a fair looking lady very rude ,i visited first time and she commented on us just because we got confuse where the line is going...shamless dont know how to behave with customer......i never seen like her 
Great place to have Indian food, especially there yogurt curry (kadi in hindi). Service is quick and the staff is very courteous.
The food was the best Indian food I have had in a while.
Best place in Fullerton for Indian food.
Decent prices, tons of food, super delicious
Great portions of delicious, authentic food for a great price. I come here every chance I get!
Authentic taste, great naan, veggie options and fast!
I love the food here. Definitely the best Indian food restaurant in the US
Satisfy your curry cravings! This small spot offers an assortment of traditional Indian food. They pack each plate with a mountain of rice and your choice of sides. They also offer tasty, warm bread. The prices fairly reasonable. This is one of my favorite curry spots and probably one of the best around!Best KBBQ! Excellent service, and excellent food! Dinner AYCE is $23 but it's definitely worth it! Used to eat at Gen Korean BBQ but this one beats it. Definitely give this place a try, wait might be long though 
One of the best AYCE korean BBQ places.  Clean space, severs friendly and the meat is delicious!  This place can get a bit loud so don't expect to have quiet and sweet romantic moments.  This place is about stuffing your face with some darn good Korean BBQ!  Wait can be very long, but you can't blame them for being popular it just means the food is good.  They do give you a buzzer with a number so you can sit in the car or walk a max distance of 1 mile away (this is according to the severs I did not test it).  If it is your birthday let them know and be prepared to get embarrassed.
One of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ spots. Great for lunch and dinner. The quality of food and service is excellent. 
Best KBBQ from San Diego until you reach LA, irregardless of AYCE or not.  You don't even have to order premium, the original is just as quality.  #6 Mr BBQ on the original is very similar to the premium short ribs.  What's also great is they have Kids prices 5-10 year old $9.99 lunch and $13.99 dinner.
Cheap and yummy. Even though you need to wait (maybe a long time), cause you can play cards when u wait!( TIP: if you don't want to wait, go 5.pm if you want dinner, and go 10.am if you go to lunch. Lunch is much cheaper.)
Great food.. go here hungry, ask for as much as you want don't be scared.. :) always busy.. 
My new favorite AYCE KBBQ spot. We came at 6pm on a Thursday night, and the wait was about 35 minutes. By 6:30, the wait was about an hour. The service was the best I've ever received at a KBBQ restaurant. The servers were quick and friendly. I loved it! The server even brought out a kids tray for my son. So kid-friendly! The sides were all so good, and there were plenty of different sides. The meat was also some of the best that I've ever tried! I also enjoyed the small scoop of mint and chip ice cream at the end. It was the perfect way to end the meal. I'll be returning here often!The BEST KBBQ place around. Hands down. The food is delicious, they give you plenty of appetizers and don’t mind refilling them. When I asked for a lot of rice paper, guess what? They brought a ton of rice paper and kept me filled up  the whole time I was there. Most of the time, I didn’t even need to mention that I was running out and they would bring more.
I highly recommend this restaurant to any lovers of Korean BBQ or anyone who wants a meal with a smile or just a lot of food.
Over-rated... the price is comparable with most Korean BBQ in the area. The food is greatly good and the service is excellent. 
The meat selection is very good.  The quality of meat is excellent.  In addition the portion size is larger than other places.  The marinated meats are all excellent also.  Side dishes good too.  I really can't find a fault in the food.
Long wait on busy days but worth it! Went with 4 other people and got the combo 2 for $99+ soooo much food! Good but really filling, better to get the individual plates.
This place is kinda ridiculously funny. Food is good. And the atmosphere is hilarious with tons of fun and activity and music going off to celebrate people's birthdays and clubby neon lighting. Food is good here, so the other stuff is just funny and entertaining 
Food was great, service was even better. Our waiter brought us two free dishes to try out, and it was a good amount of food, even for 8 people. I would definitely be back
This is the best Korean BBQ place i ve been so far.  Food was very fresh and meat was tender.  I will defintely come back again if i were in the area.Very slow service, regardless of how good the food is; there has to be a balance between service and quality and they do not have that.
Nice pizza place. Good food,  good beer. Definitely going back!
The pizza is pretty good but the sandwiches are a little disappointing. The food is a bit on the pricier side for dinner, but they have good lunch specials.
I've had Oggi's dine in and delivery and in both instances the food was great. Fast seating times and accurate delivery estimates make ordering a breeze. They have more than just pizza, but you'll come here for pizza.
delicious food, good beer selection and great service! i love coming here!
Had the chance to stop by Oggis last night and had a great time. They have awesome daily and happy hour specials and they don't skimp on their food portions too. If you like cheese fries check theirs out for happy hour. It will definitely fill you up. Oggis also has their own brews which is pretty neat. It's nice to see a brewery who focuses on traditional styles and does not lean on smoke and mirrors in their beer. "I'm calling you at barrel aged, nitro, wild,  and other hoopla people add to beer when it is not really necessary." They have ample space and fit a group of 15 on short notice with no problem. You get college students, professors, and locals at this spot. Service was a tad slow, but other than that no complaints!
Love every aspect of this place....service, food and atmosphere. I am at Oggis Fullerton regularly and have never had a bad meal there. All of their menu is amazing. 
Bad slow service. Had event here, took too long to receive food and beer.
Just had a hamburger here and got food poisoned....So good luck!Fast service, food was good, and the restaurant was fairly clean.
Wait took 15 minutes, portion sizes are a joke for 7-10$ a plate minus a drink. Don't waste your time go to the location off of Orangethorpe, at least you'll get full.
My personal favorite place to eat when on-campus, mostly because it takes almost no time for you to get your food.
Great environment to do work and food 
People were so friendly food was good
Excellent service, beautiful people and great food and coffee ..
Not a huge fan of Panera. Food is a bit over priced for what you get. 
Pretty chill spot, good food, can be a little pricey. Good place to sit and relax, quiet place to get work done .
THIS FULLERTON LOCATION IS THE BEST!! BRIANNA IS SO DELIGHTFUL AND HELPFUL ALL THE STAFF AT THIS LOCATION ARE. THE FOOD IS AMAZING A SPECIAL TREAT ON A SUNDAY MORNING. I AM ABSOLUTELY ADDICTED TO THE BREAKFAST MENU.. THANKS PANERA FOR GETTING UP SO EARLY FOR US..... KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK .SINCERELY,MARY BETH AND GARRETT
Good food and plenty of tables in case you're coming here to study.
Everything I've tried here has tasted a little "off" compared to other Paneras. The tomato soup wasn't even a safe choice here. I do not recommend this location!
Suttle side spot with  lots  of smile  and soft music, food is great!!!!
Tried pho before at the brea mall, of course it it didn't taste that great because you know it's the mall. came here alone about a week ago or two and fell in love. Brought some friends and soon take my parents out here to eat. Absolutely love the pho here
Good food.
The menu is too small, but the quality is great in food and service.
It's OK. We go here cause it's convenient and ok. To go service is a little iffy. Always seem to get something wrong. Pho is solid but apps are bland. Not the best not the worst. Slightly expensive for the taste
Overall expeirence there was ok. They have a very nice atmosphere and their service is very good. However I had the spring roll as an appetizer with noodle soup with rare beef, brisket and tendon. Compared to other places the soup was good however they give you very little tendon. The spring rolls had a very powerful taste and the sauce they had with it was not very tasty either. Above all else it was expensive for what you got compared to others. So for overall I would say that the service was really great and they had such a beautiful atmosphere however they do need improving on quality of food and the price 
Great place! This restaurant is really beautiful and calm inside. The staff is friendly and cheerful. The food is really fresh and yummy!
Thinking of having a nice, crispy, juicy, healthy, good for your wallet kind of meal?  Well,  Pieology meets all these requirements.  It's like Chipotle for pizza.  First,  you get in line(which can be really long),  and decide how many types of meats or vegetables you want on your pizza, then you can add 1 or 2, heck you can add all the meats and vegetables for the same low  price of $7.50.  The long wait can be daunting, but the speed at which you wait for your food is SERIOUSLY LESS THAN 5 MINUTES!  I timed them, seriously less than 5.  The food is ridiculously good, and the service is awesome too.  
great thin crust pizza, fresh ingredients. this place works like a subway or chipotle in that you choose your toppings as you walk down a line. good customer service, but there is a rush around dinner time so if youre planning on going during that time, it's smart to order online and pick up your pizza 
I like these places where everyone can get what they want. It satisfies picky eaters. And no one has to settle. Pieology is great because the toppings are unlimited. Everything was fresh, tasted great and was quickly served to our table. I love the variety of toppings and being able to get something different since it is all yours. No one would eat my all veggie pizza. 
Parking is always an issue here when school is in session but I love the food. Always fresh and always hot. 
If you're a true foodie... Go here. It's WELL worth the commute and experience. 
$8 for an unlimited toppings pizza! Awesome value, good food, great customer service. We love this place! 
I came here out of curiosity at first, and now it's one of my more regular places to eat. The location and atmosphere is interesting and pleasant, the service is good, and of course the pizza is delicious. With plenty of choices and the ability to create your own pizza for a great price, this makes coming back to try different combinations utterly worth it. That being said, if there is one thing I'm not sold on, it's the way the pizza is given to the customer if you don't ask for a to-go box. The pizza is placed on a wooden peel after it is cooked (a wooden peel is basically a flat wooden board with tapered sides and a handle that's usually used to stick certain types of pizza into an oven) and the customer is given that to use as the plate.  While it does look rather stylish and is pretty unique, this truthfully just comes off as clunky at best and really awkward to carry at worst. Not only do you have to worry about potentially dropping it or mosquitoes from outside, but this also means the pizza itself is getting colder faster. Plus it also makes getting a drink if your alone much more difficult since you either have to worry about dropping it while getting a drink or leaving it back at your table where anyone could take it/touch it. It's never happened yet, but  weird things do happen. Maybe this is supposed to be environmentally friendly or something, but Needless to say, I always ask for a to-go box. Overall, a great place for quick and delicious pizza, with a rather odd and awkward bit that I'm not sold on.
Build your own pizza with local breweries on tap. Driving through tonight we stopped in by chance and liked it. Very clean, curious, friendly and helpful employees. Liked the food, beer and atmosphere.
I'm a coffee drinker, they make it fresh when I buy a meal,  even late at night."
I definitely recommend this place. I love the spicy beef salad here! The cashew chicken, sweet and sour chicken are also good. love the lunch and dinner specials. Lots of good flavors in their good. Service is usually pretty good.Listen to the other reviews, don't go past a 7 in spiciness. 
Delicious food. Fast service. Lunch specials are perfect for a quick meal on a budget.
Very slow service. Food was pretty good. There are better thai restaurants for the same price elsewhere.
Food is so good, place is clean great price
My girls love Thai food.  Their favorite dishes  are Pad Thai and Pad See Ew!  Great service! Food was so flavorful and tasted fresh.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
Never Never Never Going back there... Bad waitress service and not good food. Ordered Green curry and Thai Basil chicken (there was not one basil leaf in my dish). I usually order from across the street but they were closed. Thought I would give Thai Basil a try. When I ordered they told me 20 min. I got there after 30 min, - no one greeted me, infact when I tried to get the waitress attention, she snapped and said hold on. Then she tells me i have to wait another 10 min and when I asked why she got upset and said the lady inside would help me out and walked away. Finally, someone from inside came out and dropped the bag of food on the counter and went back in. Then the same rude waitress came back charged me and said here you go... no "sorry for the wait" or Thank you."  I usually don't give bad reviews, but I found a small piece of wire / plastic in the Thai Basil chicken (i am not sure what it was but definitely not edible.)
Good quality Thai food at a good price.
I have been a client for over 10 years and have always enjoyed the food.  But lately their service has become poor.  Place the order on the phone and I got scolded for their own mistake.  Also, they have been not very welcoming when I go there with my 2 year who is well behaved.  Probably because I am a vegetarian.  I wish their service will improve.
Best Thai food outside of Thailand! Word is bond.
Best Thai food in Orange County, in a non-descript shopping mall.
The food is consistently good and fairly priced. The service is prompt but not friendly.
great food and service
Good service, very good food at reasonable prices.
Good food and service.
Good service and delicious food.  Be sure to look at the "rice plates" section of the menu, which has good stuff that you can order sans rice if you want to -- I had a dish with crispy pork skins that was amazing.  The thick porridge with preserved egg would have been excellent drunk food.
We have been going to Thai Basil for over 12 years now.....say about every ten days on the average. We have never had a bad serving of anything. We have always been treated well by the staff and you have to respect their speed and competency, even when they get very busy. The vegetables are fresh and all their food preparation is excellent, never overcooked.  We call Thai Basil "the  kitchen" because it has become our second kitchen
Best Thai food in the area. Never disappointed!
Great food great service.  We always get take out at least twice a week
An especially favorite here for us locals, come try this restaurant out. Authentic Thai food and great, friendly service. Try the various curries and don't forget to order your lunch or dinner special.
I honestly did like the food, it was delicious and served promptly. However, I only give it 2 stars instead of 4 because of how I was treated. A waitress working there did not acknowledge me, talk to me if she got my order, and when my food was served I was also introduced to the bill. They really gave me the experience of not being wanted. The food gets 4 stars but service gets 2.
Great Thai food. Amazing curry and pad Thai. Me and my wife eat here all the time. It's also in a great location. Easy to find, easy to get to.
Food was good and price is reasonable.  But service is a slow, need to improve on customer service.
love thai food. did not disappoint.
I really like this place,Food is really Good, But Bad Service
Good food
Great service great food
The food is excellent!
I did take out, twice in three days.  Quick, professional, fantastic food.  I eat spicy, ordered 10 in 1 to 10, my fault, order 7, fantastic food ..
One of my friends said that this restaurant doesn't serve authentic Thai food, but it doesn't really matter to me. The quality and price rock and the waitresses are consistently friendly and attentive (except perhaps when every table is filled, but that's probably to be expected anyway)!
Excellent food at a reasonable price. Dinner specials are great. Friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere. Perfect for a leisurely family meal.
great food at a great price.
The food is very good especially the lunch specials. The prices are more than fair. I've tried other Thai places in the area and this is my favorite when I'm in the area.
I'm so happy we found this restaurant! The Thai place we used to go changed hands and went downhill. Everything we ordered at Thai Basil was delicious! Perfectly spiced and flavored. We've also ordered takeout with the same great results. We went to another local Thai restaurant and spent the meal saying how the food wasn't nearly as good as Thai Basil.
I recently went to famed Chomp restaurant, and the whole time was there I was thinking "Man I wish I was at Thai Basil right now" lol.  Great food match by there Great service.  Me and my girlfriend love eating at this place and always look for reasons to go.I love this place. It has good ramen and the service and prices are fair. Come in during lunch for lunch special. 
Aka soup base is preferable since the spicy covers the salt flavor. I hate salty foods!
Been going here for years! Great food and service.
They have excellent food. This is my favorite ramen place.... i eat here regularly and have not been disappointed. 5/5 would reccomend to anyone... must stop by if youre in fullerton and looking for authentic Japanese food 
Comfort food! Ramen! So good! Small place and a lot of people go here, so waiting time can be 30mis or more before you get seated.  After finishing your food dont stay long because alot of people is waiting to take your seat. I go here late dinner time to avoid crowd. Most of the time i order for to go if there is a line and crowded.. yes they serve alcohol here!
Aka ramen with takoyaki!. Their spicy miso base is really good. This place does get crowded during school year for lunch as it's very close to CSU Fullerton; so be prepared to wait.
Went here with my girlfriend for lunch. We paid $25 for two and were both able to get a nice sized bowl of Shoyu with gyoza and pork fried rice on the side. My girlfriend did the social media challenge was able to get enough likes to get us a free side of noodles, which were greatly appreciated. This place is always crowded but we got lucky and sat at the bar. Service was was and we were in and out within 45 minutes. Definitely the best place for Ramen near CSUF.
We came here last night with friends. All of us ordered apps. My gf wasn't impressed with the apps they ordered but her hubby was raving. I ordered the Cha Shu pork app and my hubby ordered Buta and Kim. My app came with 4 super thin slices of pork over a mound of bean sprouts. Good but I felt ripped off. Hubby's was ok. We all ordered ramen (both chicken and pork broth versions) and we were all pretty happy with the ramen broth and noodles but we all felt ripped off with the amount of meat offered. There were 3 super thin slices of pork. The rest were fillers. You get more bang for your buck at Ajisen. However the kids all wolfed down their food, even our friends finicky eater so that's a plus. 
Excellent service and excellent food. The Ramen reminds of the time I visited a Shop during a brief visit in Tokyo, Japan.  The Cha Ramen and the creamy, delicious broth continues to be one of my favorites.  I don't have a least favorite with this place as every thing I have eaten at What's Up Men is excellent. 
Outstanding service and food!! Definitely will come back again
However, it is good food and they do things correctly in preparation
Good food and environment.  Upbeat atmosphere.  Ramen never disappoints.
Great food here,  and the staff is really nice. 
Great food, good service, but wait for tables can be long
