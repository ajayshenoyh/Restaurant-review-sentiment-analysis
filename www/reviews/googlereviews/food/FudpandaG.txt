Fast service, food was good, and the restaurant was fairly clean.
Wait took 15 minutes, portion sizes are a joke for 7-10$ a plate minus a drink. Don't waste your time go to the location off of Orangethorpe, at least you'll get full.
My personal favorite place to eat when on-campus, mostly because it takes almost no time for you to get your food.
