Suttle side spot with  lots  of smile  and soft music, food is great!!!!
Tried pho before at the brea mall, of course it it didn't taste that great because you know it's the mall. came here alone about a week ago or two and fell in love. Brought some friends and soon take my parents out here to eat. Absolutely love the pho here
Good food.
The menu is too small, but the quality is great in food and service.
It's OK. We go here cause it's convenient and ok. To go service is a little iffy. Always seem to get something wrong. Pho is solid but apps are bland. Not the best not the worst. Slightly expensive for the taste
Overall expeirence there was ok. They have a very nice atmosphere and their service is very good. However I had the spring roll as an appetizer with noodle soup with rare beef, brisket and tendon. Compared to other places the soup was good however they give you very little tendon. The spring rolls had a very powerful taste and the sauce they had with it was not very tasty either. Above all else it was expensive for what you got compared to others. So for overall I would say that the service was really great and they had such a beautiful atmosphere however they do need improving on quality of food and the price 
Great place! This restaurant is really beautiful and calm inside. The staff is friendly and cheerful. The food is really fresh and yummy!
