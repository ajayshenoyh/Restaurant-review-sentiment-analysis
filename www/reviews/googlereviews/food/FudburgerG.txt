Good fast food, good prices and good choice in combos. Need to be more clean and organized.
I was two cents short and the young lady gave me real nasty attitude,  if such a problem for them then don't work in fast food.  The food was O. K. and I would go back again.  The fries were fresh after they gave me a small fry instead of the large I ordered, so they had to cook more! So besides the bad customer service by the one female,  it was O. K. 
The food is okay but if you get something from the doller menu , it feels like your getting nothing , it doesn't fill you up like McDonalds. But the ice coffee is really good and I've went back for seconds. Better then Starbucks and cheaper.
