Fast service, food was good, and the restaurant was fairly clean.
Fast/Quality Service, even during rushes they greet you and ask if you'll like to try any samples.
The one inside CSUF is way better.
Wait took 15 minutes, portion sizes are a joke for 7-10$ a plate minus a drink. Don't waste your time go to the location off of Orangethorpe, at least you'll get full.
My personal favorite place to eat when on-campus, mostly because it takes almost no time for you to get your food.
