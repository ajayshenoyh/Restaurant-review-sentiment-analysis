Awesome place to have Indian nourishment, particularly there yogurt curry (kadi in hindi). Administration is speedy and the staff is exceptionally affable.

Best place in Fullerton for Indian food.
I love this place. They have a good rotation of excellent curries. Though I am not a vegetarian, I like to eat less meat when I can, and I like that they always have several vegetarian options to choose from here. My favorite is the cauliflower and potato curry, though their yogurt curry, eggplant, and veggie korma are all really good too. I did try the chicken curry once as well, and I liked it a lot - perfect amount of spice and a nice ratio of chicken to sauce. I'm not as fond of chicken tikka masala, which they almost always have on the steam table, so I haven't tried that one. Next time I'm in the mood for meat I'm trying the goat curry. I love goat curry, and theirs does look good.
