Great place to eat when on-campus and looking for some variety
Literally the worst service I've ever gotten. I never post reviews and I had to for this place. Awful. 
Went here with a group of friends and saw that the place was good for groups . Very lively and nice atmosphere inside and friendly staff. The food was still sizzling when it came out and the fajitas we ordered were very tasty! All the ingredients were fresh and had great flavor. Would definitely recommend to anyone and will be back !
I always enjoy the white people spin on burritos. Everyone stared at me when I yelled I love this place. 
Delicious food, the best place to minus your hunger. Super fast service.
Awesome place to have Indian nourishment, particularly there yogurt curry (kadi in hindi). Administration is speedy and the staff is exceptionally affable.
You can dine and take out food...its a cafeteria type place so service is a bit faster......
If you like indian food, give this place a try. Affordable and authentic 
Great place to have Indian food, especially there yogurt curry (kadi in hindi). Service is quick and the staff is very courteous.
Best place in Fullerton for Indian food.
I love this place. They have a good rotation of excellent curries. Though I am not a vegetarian, I like to eat less meat when I can, and I like that they always have several vegetarian options to choose from here. My favorite is the cauliflower and potato curry, though their yogurt curry, eggplant, and veggie korma are all really good too. I did try the chicken curry once as well, and I liked it a lot - perfect amount of spice and a nice ratio of chicken to sauce. I'm not as fond of chicken tikka masala, which they almost always have on the steam table, so I haven't tried that one. Next time I'm in the mood for meat I'm trying the goat curry. I love goat curry, and theirs does look good.
Best KBBQ! Excellent service, and excellent food! Dinner AYCE is $23 but it's definitely worth it! Used to eat at Gen Korean BBQ but this one beats it. Definitely give this place a try, wait might be long though 
One of the best AYCE korean BBQ places.  Clean space, severs friendly and the meat is delicious!  This place can get a bit loud so don't expect to have quiet and sweet romantic moments.  This place is about stuffing your face with some darn good Korean BBQ!  Wait can be very long, but you can't blame them for being popular it just means the food is good.  They do give you a buzzer with a number so you can sit in the car or walk a max distance of 1 mile away (this is according to the severs I did not test it).  If it is your birthday let them know and be prepared to get embarrassed.
My new favorite AYCE KBBQ spot. We came at 6pm on a Thursday night, and the wait was about 35 minutes. By 6:30, the wait was about an hour. The service was the best I've ever received at a KBBQ restaurant. The servers were quick and friendly. I loved it! The server even brought out a kids tray for my son. So kid-friendly! The sides were all so good, and there were plenty of different sides. The meat was also some of the best that I've ever tried! I also enjoyed the small scoop of mint and chip ice cream at the end. It was the perfect way to end the meal. I'll be returning here often!The BEST KBBQ place around. Hands down. The food is delicious, they give you plenty of appetizers and don’t mind refilling them. When I asked for a lot of rice paper, guess what? They brought a ton of rice paper and kept me filled up  the whole time I was there. Most of the time, I didn’t even need to mention that I was running out and they would bring more.
There is usually a long wait for a table here. Sometimes over an hour depending on your party size, but it’s well worth the wait over any of the other Korean BBQ places in the Orange County area. And they somehow manage to do it while being an all you can eat place.
The problem I have with this place is the extremely loud, and very bright atmosphere. Kids screaming and running around wow... dangerous.
Quality of meat and service makes this Korean bbq a good time. Went with a party of six and we enjoyed almost every cut of meat from pork cheek to filet. Beer is good but they lose a star for surrounding us with tv's like this is a sports bar.
The meat selection is very good.  The quality of meat is excellent.  In addition the portion size is larger than other places.  The marinated meats are all excellent also.  Side dishes good too.  I really can't find a fault in the food.
The Best Korean BBQ in Fullerton. Good place for party.
This place is kinda ridiculously funny. Food is good. And the atmosphere is hilarious with tons of fun and activity and music going off to celebrate people's birthdays and clubby neon lighting. Food is good here, so the other stuff is just funny and entertaining 
This place is great for an ayce place. Came here around 830- 9 and had to wait til 10 before getting a spot.
One of the best kbbq places I've been to.
Great place, reminder call in ahead to see if there a lots of birthday party. Came on a day where there were 15 birthday. It took two hour to get in and seated 
This is the best Korean BBQ place i ve been so far.  Food was very fresh and meat was tender.  I will defintely come back again if i were in the area.Nice pizza place. Good food,  good beer. Definitely going back!
Love every aspect of this place....service, food and atmosphere. I am at Oggis Fullerton regularly and have never had a bad meal there. All of their menu is amazing. 
My wife and I love this place, good pizza, great beer, staff make us feel welcome...  would like to give 5 stars, but parking is a problem.
My personal favorite place to eat when on-campus, mostly because it takes almost no time for you to get your food.
Great environment to do work and food 
I will say though that this is a great place if you want to grab a coffee and just chill. Usually fairly quite. Good for chill morning meetings. 
Úsaaly these places are aceptable this location is dirty and has an awful putred smell that makes you want to throw up the bathrooms are filthy dining area  not attended plates on tables lack of obvious supervison and team effort to make this place the best it can be put your self in the place of the customer and you guys will find the answer
Place was fine but internet is slow as molasses.
Pretty chill spot, good food, can be a little pricey. Good place to sit and relax, quiet place to get work done .
I never really knew where Panera Bread fit into the scheme of things, but upon visiting one, I now know. The common thing that I saw here were students with textbooks and lounging senior citizens. I cannot say I am a fan of the place, but from the outside, it's certainly welcoming and clean. On the inside, there was plenty seating and friendly staff. Hot and iced coffee had free refills.
I like this place. Frendly and nice staff.
The pho is amazing... N1 pho combo! The tender is the best I've had. They have wine here!.. a gem in the wall i love this place. 
Overall expeirence there was ok. They have a very nice atmosphere and their service is very good. However I had the spring roll as an appetizer with noodle soup with rare beef, brisket and tendon. Compared to other places the soup was good however they give you very little tendon. The spring rolls had a very powerful taste and the sauce they had with it was not very tasty either. Above all else it was expensive for what you got compared to others. So for overall I would say that the service was really great and they had such a beautiful atmosphere however they do need improving on quality of food and the price 
Great place! This restaurant is really beautiful and calm inside. The staff is friendly and cheerful. The food is really fresh and yummy!
For appertizer, I ordered a dish of spring rolls.  It was very fresh and tasty!  For main dish, I had pho number 1 large bowl.  The soup was so good that I drank it all!  Unlike other pho places, the meat here is all fillet mignon and fresh. The Thai tea was excellent too.  The total price was reasonable.  I was filled up and totally satisfied.
I like to have a lot of toppings on my pizza so this place is heaven for me. 
great thin crust pizza, fresh ingredients. this place works like a subway or chipotle in that you choose your toppings as you walk down a line. good customer service, but there is a rush around dinner time so if youre planning on going during that time, it's smart to order online and pick up your pizza 
I love Pieology, especially this location. I've never had a bad experience here. The only thing that came close was the one time where the line was so long that it went around the restaurant and through the back exit door and I had to wait in line next to the ramen place next door, but that shows how good this place is. I like how you can have your pizza your way. The cinnamon dessert is also something that I highly recommend. The staff here are really courteous and helpful, the atmosphere is very chill, and parking isn't bad at all since it's in a shopping center parking lot. I definitely recommend this place. 
I like these places where everyone can get what they want. It satisfies picky eaters. And no one has to settle. Pieology is great because the toppings are unlimited. Everything was fresh, tasted great and was quickly served to our table. I love the variety of toppings and being able to get something different since it is all yours. No one would eat my all veggie pizza. 
The only complaint is the place is really loud. Chairs that scrape and squawk on a cement floor coupled with loud music and a interior with no noise reduction features, created a meal where you can't talk during the meal when it is busy. And it was busy. We pretty much hurried up and ate, which might be their goal. Get you in and out fast! 
Out of all the make your own pizza place restaurants that have spring up over the last few years, pieology is still my favorite. It doesn't have the most topping options, but the selection is still solid and the pizzas are consistently good. The crust here is also my favorite. My only complaint about this location is that it can sometimes get very loud inside. It makes it hard to hold a conversation. 
I love pieology but this place is just so packed all of the time...
Love this place!   I get what I ask for.  Staff is always friendly and ready to help. More cheese?  Just say when.  More olives? Is this enough.
Always love this place. I can customize my pizza. They also provide wheat for pizza which make my pizza more healthy. 
This place specializes in pizza and they do it really well. So don't go here thinking that their dessert menu is where their strength is at. 
$8 for an unlimited toppings pizza! Awesome value, good food, great customer service. We love this place! 
I came here out of curiosity at first, and now it's one of my more regular places to eat. The location and atmosphere is interesting and pleasant, the service is good, and of course the pizza is delicious. With plenty of choices and the ability to create your own pizza for a great price, this makes coming back to try different combinations utterly worth it. That being said, if there is one thing I'm not sold on, it's the way the pizza is given to the customer if you don't ask for a to-go box. The pizza is placed on a wooden peel after it is cooked (a wooden peel is basically a flat wooden board with tapered sides and a handle that's usually used to stick certain types of pizza into an oven) and the customer is given that to use as the plate.  While it does look rather stylish and is pretty unique, this truthfully just comes off as clunky at best and really awkward to carry at worst. Not only do you have to worry about potentially dropping it or mosquitoes from outside, but this also means the pizza itself is getting colder faster. Plus it also makes getting a drink if your alone much more difficult since you either have to worry about dropping it while getting a drink or leaving it back at your table where anyone could take it/touch it. It's never happened yet, but  weird things do happen. Maybe this is supposed to be environmentally friendly or something, but Needless to say, I always ask for a to-go box. Overall, a great place for quick and delicious pizza, with a rather odd and awkward bit that I'm not sold on.
Cool pizza place. You can get whatever toppings you want for $8.50. I tried the Herald pizza. It was very good. They have good variety of beer on tap.
I love the feel of his place. It is like you are in a early 1900's factory. The great thing is you don't have to worry about getting injured or something. It did smell pizza in there. 
I'm hoping that this place doesn't fall victim to the curse of this location because the pizza is amazing and the customer service is unbelievable! I'm not the biggest beer guy either, but damn they have some good beer and a huge selection
The Pizza Press is very similar to other thin crust build your own pizza places. However I like the cooking method used at the Pizza Press more than other restaurants. At The Pizza Press each pizza is put through a conveyor oven individually, this results in a less greasy pizza. 
My wife and I really like this place. There are very helpful with her gluten allergy, and the pizza is great. I love their beer selection! It is very eclectic, this is the place to find a rare beer on tap...or coldbrew.
This place is 24 hours which is great. Service can be a hit or miss depending on what time you go and who is helping you
Good place, I go there at least a few times a week. I like their soup too (i know, subway soup). They make subs good!
I go here almost every friday for the Tuna deal they have. Its the closest from my work and easy to deal with since you can order through the app. Most times ive picked up through the app there were things off about the sandwich (ill get extra ingredients or things are missing, the directions werent followed as closely etc). Today, Jasmine did my order, and it was a great sandwich. Her attention to detail was on spot and she even wrapped my sandwich twice without requesting (never even thought of that. I always have a problem with the juices leaking over time). In general this place is pretty good and their indoor facility is clean and usually quick when they are a little busy. I dont expect perfection with the app orders most times anyway but Jasmine really went above and beyond today. 
A good place.I definitely recommend this place. I love the spicy beef salad here! The cashew chicken, sweet and sour chicken are also good. love the lunch and dinner specials. Lots of good flavors in their good. Service is usually pretty good.Listen to the other reviews, don't go past a 7 in spiciness. 
Food is so good, place is clean great price
Nice place I've been to a few Thai restaurants and this one had a similar vibe and the feel. Decor uses lots of reds and the staff is nice.
I have been a client for over 10 years and have always enjoyed the food.  But lately their service has become poor.  Place the order on the phone and I got scolded for their own mistake.  Also, they have been not very welcoming when I go there with my 2 year who is well behaved.  Probably because I am a vegetarian.  I wish their service will improve.
It was an okay Thai place. Nothing to grand about it, but not terrible. If I was in the area again, I would eat there again.
I really like this place,Food is really Good, But Bad Service
Best Thai place in Fullerton
The food is very good especially the lunch specials. The prices are more than fair. I've tried other Thai places in the area and this is my favorite when I'm in the area.
I'm so happy we found this restaurant! The Thai place we used to go changed hands and went downhill. Everything we ordered at Thai Basil was delicious! Perfectly spiced and flavored. We've also ordered takeout with the same great results. We went to another local Thai restaurant and spent the meal saying how the food wasn't nearly as good as Thai Basil.
I recently went to famed Chomp restaurant, and the whole time was there I was thinking "Man I wish I was at Thai Basil right now" lol.  Great food match by there Great service.  Me and my girlfriend love eating at this place and always look for reasons to go.I love this place. It has good ramen and the service and prices are fair. Come in during lunch for lunch special. 
This place is always great. The broth is great and rich, the pork is tender, and the staff is super friendly. 
Probably the best Ramen place around. Super Dry Draft is the choice of beer here. 
Sensei approves.  Best place for a quick meal or awesome alcohol.
They have excellent food. This is my favorite ramen place.... i eat here regularly and have not been disappointed. 5/5 would reccomend to anyone... must stop by if youre in fullerton and looking for authentic Japanese food 
Comfort food! Ramen! So good! Small place and a lot of people go here, so waiting time can be 30mis or more before you get seated.  After finishing your food dont stay long because alot of people is waiting to take your seat. I go here late dinner time to avoid crowd. Most of the time i order for to go if there is a line and crowded.. yes they serve alcohol here!
Aka ramen with takoyaki!. Their spicy miso base is really good. This place does get crowded during school year for lunch as it's very close to CSU Fullerton; so be prepared to wait.
Went here with my girlfriend for lunch. We paid $25 for two and were both able to get a nice sized bowl of Shoyu with gyoza and pork fried rice on the side. My girlfriend did the social media challenge was able to get enough likes to get us a free side of noodles, which were greatly appreciated. This place is always crowded but we got lucky and sat at the bar. Service was was and we were in and out within 45 minutes. Definitely the best place for Ramen near CSUF.
Excellent service and excellent food. The Ramen reminds of the time I visited a Shop during a brief visit in Tokyo, Japan.  The Cha Ramen and the creamy, delicious broth continues to be one of my favorites.  I don't have a least favorite with this place as every thing I have eaten at What's Up Men is excellent. 
Good food and environment.  Upbeat atmosphere.  Ramen never disappoints.
The ramen is ok. I think their side dishes or appetizers are better. Place is open late since it's near cal state Fullerton university. The broth is good but not enough cha shu. They serve beer too.
