Very slow service, regardless of how good the food is; there has to be a balance between service and quality and they do not have that.
Blackened Santa Fe Chicken salad was to die for! So good! Plus the service was amazing!
delicious food, good beer selection and great service! i love coming here!
Had the chance to stop by Oggis last night and had a great time. They have awesome daily and happy hour specials and they don't skimp on their food portions too. If you like cheese fries check theirs out for happy hour. It will definitely fill you up. Oggis also has their own brews which is pretty neat. It's nice to see a brewery who focuses on traditional styles and does not lean on smoke and mirrors in their beer. "I'm calling you at barrel aged, nitro, wild,  and other hoopla people add to beer when it is not really necessary." They have ample space and fit a group of 15 on short notice with no problem. You get college students, professors, and locals at this spot. Service was a tad slow, but other than that no complaints!
Love every aspect of this place....service, food and atmosphere. I am at Oggis Fullerton regularly and have never had a bad meal there. All of their menu is amazing. 
Excellent service and quality ingredients. the pizza is very good. The drafts selection is just as good. I was not impressed by the lettuce wraps: got peanuts and not cashews, sesame oil and mustard not enough as sauces, missing something a bit tastier. the chicken required more chives and to be cut into smaller more manageable pieces.
My wife and I love this place, good pizza, great beer, staff make us feel welcome...  would like to give 5 stars, but parking is a problem.
Bad slow service. Had event here, took too long to receive food and beer.
