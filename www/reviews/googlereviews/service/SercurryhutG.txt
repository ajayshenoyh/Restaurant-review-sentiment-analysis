Great Indian food at a good price and very fast service. I can be in and out in less than 5 min.
Awesome place to have Indian nourishment, particularly there yogurt curry (kadi in hindi). Administration is speedy and the staff is exceptionally affable.
The food is decent, but somehow not as flavorful as the Indian food I'm used to. Service is quick and friendly, and the selection is familiar if not extensive - they seem to carry between 8 and 12 dishes at any given time. 
You can dine and take out food...its a cafeteria type place so service is a bit faster......
Great food and friendly service
