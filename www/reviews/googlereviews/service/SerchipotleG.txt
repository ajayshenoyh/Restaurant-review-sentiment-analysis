Very lively and nice atmosphere inside and friendly staff.
Went here with a group of friends and saw that the place was good for groups . Very lively and nice atmosphere inside and friendly staff. The food was still sizzling when it came out and the fajitas we ordered were very tasty! All the ingredients were fresh and had great flavor. Would definitely recommend to anyone and will be back !
Delicious food, the best place to minus your hunger. Super fast service.
Delicious food, great atmosphere. Great service. 
Busy location but fast service. Seating are was clean. 
It's a few minutes after 11am, which means they just opened and there's already a line..it's moving rather quickly. I'm ordering in three minutes. Meat serving is decent, the lettuce looks a little dry. Service is average, looks clean. Will come back.
