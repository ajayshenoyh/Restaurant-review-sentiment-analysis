Because of the street name, I suspect that this was one of the first Carl's Jr's. I had some kind of Breakfast Burger that had just about everything they sold on it. The security guard was from Cameroon, so I was able to speak French with him.

Burgers are better than any other Fast Food place, good place to go when you come back late from a park or event and need a quick Dinner

We drove through after a long day at the park for a quick bite to eat in the car for the drive home. food was hot and better than your average fast food place. service was nice and quick. we would go back again if we needed a quick meal on the go.

Much better than Burger King and McDonalds, their milkshakes and malt drinks are superb. Good place to visit if you arrive late back from the parks and want a quick meal.

For fast food ,Carl's Jr has a great hamburger.. When the leaf lettuce and the char broiling it tops my list of great fast food burgers. The restaurants are very clean and even the bathroom ,I've found to clean

This is one of the cleanest fast food place I have been to. I think it may have something to do with the fact the management company of the whe chain is located nearby. The salad is a little light on chicken slices but tasty. The original hamberg is good

This is one of the better fast-food restaurants available. It beats McDonald's, & Burger King, and is as good as Wendy's if not better. Fast service, and clean restaurant. Would eat here again.

We loved the shakes especially the chocolate chip banana shakes and vanilla shake were to die for. The breakfast wraps were fantastic.
</p><p class="partial_entry">
Food was fine but really slow. Even when there were 10 people in line there was only one till open and staff wandered around slowly. I went twice because close to hotel and thought I might have just chosen a bad time the first time but no.

Had dinner here 9/10/12 and I can tell you I will never eat here or at Carl's Jr./Hardees again. Ever.
Now, I rarely get worked up about some multi-location fast food location, because I realize that they rarely care about complaints. I just vote with my wallet and go elsewhere, but this location deserves a special mention.

Couldn't get anyone to take our order or even acknowledge we were there. Staff was right in front of us but said nothing. Place was dirty. Alot of customers standing around waiting for their food. Decided to go to a different location off of Katella.

Food was delish. There was even a guy making balloon animals for the kids. So cute. Staff was really friendly. Excellent pancakes.
</p><p class="partial_entry">
My meal,was served piping hot. Everything was frsh and tasted great. It was accompanied by a very good service. All the members of the staff were attentive, customer oriented, and efficient. It was very clean and tidy, and treat every customer with respect and friendliness which makes a difference in the fast food service.

For me, the best part wasn't the Carl's Jr. menu, but the Green Burrito which was part of this chain. ENORMOUS portions at a great price, salsa bar, and the food, for fast food, is well above average.
</p><p class="partial_entry">
Something other then standard fast food place. This has some nice choices in Mexican. This place is good for quick bites and has a very friendly staff.

If you're looking for a good Carl's Jr this is one. It's located in a rougher neighborhood so you'll get hit up by homeless people asking for food or a hand out. I felt very safe so that's not a concern. The staff is friendly and the dining area is well kept.
