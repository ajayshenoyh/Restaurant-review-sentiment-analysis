Burger Parlor is consistently my favorite hamburger. The portions are just about perfect, not too big, but not too small. The menu is not overwhelming like some other burger joints, but there is enough variety that you can find something you will like. the ingredients all taste very fresh.
My favorite is actually no longer on the menu: the Lasorda....

We have been visiting here a lot lately. I love the buns (like in-n-out, but bigger!), and the fries (try the homemade ketchup!). I hope that they get a lot of support and stay in business! The way the store is set up is super fun, bright lights, neat design.
