My son went back to school today, but wanted to visit his favorite place before he left. Our server was Evelyn, and she was on point. We have been visiting Mr. BBQ for over a year, the food is always good, but service is either hit or miss.....Today service and food was direct hit! So thanks for a bitter sweet...

This is a super cheap bbq placed owned by Koreans. It's good and cheap meat - unlimited. But if you're looking for a &quot;korean&quot; bbq experience, this isn't the place.
