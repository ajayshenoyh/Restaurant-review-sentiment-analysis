Just like what Subway says Eat Fresh ! Great sandwiches ! Healthy eating ! They make eating sandwiches a delightful experience!

We took the train up to Anaheim and we were hungry when we got off the train. We split a turkey sub, toasted, with fresh veggies and it was a great way to start our fueling for a Disney day

Its your typical Subway, just happier because of its proximity with disneyland. Average Subway though.

We order sandwiches for dinner to take into Disneyland. The employee working that night marked our sandwiches as mom, dad, etc. Made it easy to tell who's sandwich was who's. Great service.

Everyday during our Disney vacation we'd head back the hotel for a break and get some lunch at the nearby Subway. This is a typical Subway that offers great alternative to over price food in the park. We'd get some extra cookies to bring with us into Disneyland for snacks!

We were visiting Disneyland for 3 days and looking for an inexpensive dinner option before we headed back to the park. My kids were very psyched to find the stripmall with Subway, Greek food and Chinese food. Everyone got something different and was very happy. Staff at Subway was friendly and fast!

Attentive staff. Also liked the fact that they changed gloves for each set of customers - felt good being a vegetarian!

We grabbed sandwiches after a long day at Disneyland.It wasn't too crowded and it was quick, clean and across the street from our hotel! It's a typical subway so you know what to expect.

We have 4 kids and the staff was very patient and efficient when the kids ordered their sandwiches. They had patience with them and were very nice,.

Prompt service, good sandwiches and good prices make this a great place for a quick lunch. The restaurant was clean and well-run. I would eat here again.

We bought lunch here before leaving to drive back home from Disneyland. The prices were so good in comparison to what we had been paying in the parks all week. The bread, meats, and vegetables to make the sandwiches were perfect to eat a healthy meal in the car.
