 Food is like all other locations and tasted fine. 
 Took food to go so didn't have to eat in this environment. 
 Food is always fresh and the workers are always willing to correct any problem you might encounter. 
The food is ok. 
 They say their soups are homemade yet it tastes like progresso or campbells. 
Not only is their food fresh and fast . 
My client got us tickets to see a Cal State Fullerton baseball game and brought us by for a pre-game bit to eat (stadium food was so-so).
