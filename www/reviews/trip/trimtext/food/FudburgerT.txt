 The food was wonderful - well cooked. 
 the ingredients all taste very fresh. 
 Love the fact you can taste the beers before ordering. 
 This is a walk up and order place with food brought to you. 
Decent food . 
 For basically a fast food place the prices are way out of line. 
Great food. 
While you can get all sorts of gourmet burgers here and this is a nice change from the fast food chains. 
 the onion rings are by far the best I have ever tasted. 
 Because I only put ketchup and tomatoes on my burgers the taste of the meat and bun is very. 
Wonderful place and great food. 
 Food was great and service was excellent. 
 The food. 
 The fish and chip burger had no flavor. 
 The service was very friendly and we got our food pretty quickly.
