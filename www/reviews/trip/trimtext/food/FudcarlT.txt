 food was hot and better than your average fast food place. 
 their milkshakes and malt drinks are superb.

 I rarely get worked up about some multi-location fast food location. 
 Alot of customers standing around waiting for their food. 
Food was delish.

Something other then standard fast food place. 
 It's located in a rougher neighborhood so you'll get hit up by homeless people asking for food or a hand out.
