 There are plenty of spices and stuff ok the table that we can add to enhance the flavored to taste. 
 Good food. 
 The food is fresh. 
 small sit down restaurant with nice seating and really authentic food and real Japanese chefs. 
 What we love is to come for the lunch special from Monday to Saturday (except Sunday) until 3pm. 
 The food came out quickly and I took it home to eat it about 1. 
 I was in Fullerton on Business and I stopped in for a quick lunch.
