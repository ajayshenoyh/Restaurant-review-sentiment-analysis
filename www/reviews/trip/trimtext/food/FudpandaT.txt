Panda is very good asian fast food. 
 Paying a lot of money for a minimum amount of food. 
 delicious food from Panda Express. 
It is a Chinese fast food resturant quick service. 
I generally don’t rate “fast food” restaurants . 
 there is an open and welcoming dining area) you have an immediate view of the full array of food choices and the food prep going. 
I've been to this panda a few times and the food is pretty good. 
 The food never disappoints when you are looking for greasy Chinese Food. 
Food was what you expect Panda to be. 
 and go to the food court there and they have something real similar. 
 as the name implies is basically ready made Chinese food. 
 and the food is made continually so as it gets low new food comes out piping hot. 
I always go to Panda Express for a chinese fastfood. 
 Food is similar to chinese restaurant. 
The food was fine.
