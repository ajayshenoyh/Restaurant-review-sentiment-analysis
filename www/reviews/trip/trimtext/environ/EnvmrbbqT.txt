 wanted to visit his favorite place before he left. 
We have visited this place 3 times in just a couple of months. 
We picked this place because we had a Korean student traveling with us. 
This place apparently only has tables of 6. 
 So glad our other place was closed for remodel. 
Picked this place because of ratings. 
 We waited for 90mins before e got a place. 
This is a super cheap bbq placed owned by Koreans. 
 this isn't the place. 
 I am giving this place 5 stars even though I am cooking my own food. 
My husband and I stumbled upon this restaurant while we were looking for a place to eat. 
This is an all-you-can-eat BBQ place. 
Cool place and very clean. 
 this is a place that is sure to make you a fan. 
 If you've never been to a Korean BBQ place you need to try it at least once.
