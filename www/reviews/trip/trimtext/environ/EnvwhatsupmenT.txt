 That's an issue with some of the ramen places I've been to before. 
This is a small place near Cal State Fullerton. 
 This is the type of place that you would find in the small towns of Japan.

 This place. 
 I found them to be the most popular of ramen places in a 20 miles radius (even though there's only two others).

The place is tiny. 
 Located next door to Pieology is this ramen place. 
 I can't say that this is the first place I'll think of for ramen. 
I have been looking for a good Ramen place since the one in San Diego closed. 
 I was told that it has been just six months this place was opened.
