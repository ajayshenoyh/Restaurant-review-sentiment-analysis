They moved the line along well and asked the right questions. 
 No mistakes made on my orders there. 
 Cheap option for families heading to the parks. 


Great place to grab sandwiches if you're not eating at a restaurant . 
 need something to bring back to your room to eat. 


We order sandwiches for dinner to take into Disneyland. 
 The employee working that night marked our sandwiches as mom. 
 dad. 
 etc. 
 Made it easy to tell who's sandwich was who's. 
 Great service. 


Everyday during our Disney vacation we'd head back the hotel for a break and get some lunch at the nearby Subway. 
 This is a typical Subway that offers great alternative to over price food in the park. 
 We'd get some extra cookies to bring with us into Disneyland for snacks. 


We were visiting Disneyland for 3 days and looking for an inexpensive dinner option before we headed back to the park. 
 My kids were very psyched to find the stripmall with Subway. 
 Greek food and Chinese food. 
 Everyone got something different and was very happy. 
 Staff at Subway was friendly and fast. 
 Highly recommend if you are looking for an.

Attentive staff. 
 Also liked the fact that they changed gloves for each set of customers - felt good being a vegetarian. 


We grabbed sandwiches after a long day at Disneyland. 
It wasn't too crowded and it was quick. 
 clean and across the street from our hotel. 
 It's a typical subway so you know what to expect. 


We have 4 kids and the staff was very patient and efficient when the kids ordered their sandwiches. 
 They had patience with them and were very nice. 
. 


Prompt service. 
 good sandwiches and good prices make this a great place for a quick lunch. 
 The restaurant was clean and well-run. 
 I would eat here again. 


We bought lunch here before leaving to drive back home from Disneyland. 
 The prices were so good in comparison to what we had been paying in the parks all week. 
 The bread. 
 meats. 
 and vegetables to make the sandwiches were perfect to eat a healthy meal in the car. 


As far as Subway sandwich shops go. 
 this has to be the tiniest one I've ever visited. 
 They might as well just put a window out to the parking lot and not even bother with a dining room. 
 There is hardly any room in here whatsoever and most of it is taken up by the line of people trying to.

Nice walk from hotels. 
 Did a great job keeping our large order straight. 
 Classic subway selection and classic price

We were staying near this Subway during our Disneyland stay. 
 The hotel had a brochure with a buy one 6 inch sub with a drink and get a 6 inch sub free. 
 That was a great way for two people to get a cheap and delicious meal near Disneyland. 
 I did this twice and the food was great and service.

Normal place to eat. 
 really like every other subway except very clean. 
nothing really special. 
 Location was ideal to hotel. 


I stopped here for dinner one night after a long day in the Disney park. 
 Good location and close to most hotels on Katella. 


We popped by this subway a couple of times on our trip and the food lives up to the subway standard. 
 The people though were very friendly. 
 helpful and accommodating especially when I came in with a large order. 


Grabbed lunch here and the manager and staff were really friendly. 
 We ate there a few times for a cost effective alternative to Disney

It's close to Disneyland. 
 easy and always consistent. 
 Not a lot of seating inside. 
 more of a grab and go location. 


This subway was a block away from the Castle Inn and afforded a quick. 
 inexpensive meal. 
 I wish I had gone there the first day we were there. 
 Subway had food that was tasty and clean whereas StarBurger next door served me a burger that came back up that night. 


Went here after we got to our hotel to visit Disneyland. 
 It was later in the day and were wanted something to grab quick. 
 The staff was very friendly and were neat and quick at making the sandwich. 
 We ate here more than once because they were so nice. 
 perfect place to go if you need something quick and good. 


We had Subway meals several times during our visit and the staff were friendly and efficient. 
 One time we went there was a group of young people there for a conference and a large number chose Subway for their meal. 
 The staff handled the crowd really well and we didn't have to wait that long. 


It's a decent subway with little not so happy staff. 

The cleaners were more friendly and jovial than the Mexican lady angrily assaulting my foot long. 

Not even basic courtesy of saying thanks back or welcome . 

But I had less money so I was treated like that lol

Instead of eating expensive food at Disneyland. 
 we ate at Subway across from our hotel. 
 It was fast and delicious. 


Just wanted to point out that this is a 24 hour location. 
 which is awesome given it's proximity to Disneyland. 
 We were so grateful to not have to drive thru at a McDonald's or Taco Bell when leaving the park late at night. 
 We ate here twice on our recent Disney trip and both times we got a good sandwich.

same food and same subs that we order back home in canada. 
 the prices are a bit lower in the usa. 
 . 
 with our currency so weak it probably worked out to the same price. 
 food is consistent. 
 not great. 
 . 
 consistent. 


Had breakfast and supper here a few times while visiting Disney. 
 Friendly staff and good food at reasonable prices. 


Got at 6&quot. 
 Chicken Teriyaki sub ($6. 
25) from here for a fast and easy lunch when visiting Anaheim for the NAMM Show. 
 I like to use independent sandwich shops and Deli's and only use a Subway if I have to and this Subway is small . 
 it is one of the better ones I have ever eaten in. 
 But in.

This place is so close that you could grab a sandwich quick before going to Disneyland to take it in and enjoy or after you leave the park. 
 I have ate hear many times before. 
 I believe I'm getting a healthy choice. 
 Also this location is very clean and also not a bad neighborhood. 


Though quite small. 
 this is one of the better Subway establishments I've visited. 
 They add an alarming amout of beef to the Roast Beef sandwich. 
 and for a little extra cost. 
 they will double it. 


Just another Subway restaurant with many of the same foot-long and half-foot-long sandwiches like all the rest. 
 Same ol' same ol'

Good place to get a sub and back to your hotel and eat or take it into disney. 
 The staff was friendly and efficient. 


As always Subway has the very best sandwiches made at your request. 
 They are nourishing and very satisfying. 
 The employees are very personable and friendly. 


I went here for lunch one day. 
 ordered the cheese steak sub. 
 brought it back to my hotel room to eat. 
 I had to throw it away it was that bad. 
 the steak was so fatty and stringy nothing like other Subway's that I have been to. 
 My Mother ordered a Turkey & Cheese on wheat she was so disappointed.

When we were just looking for a quick snack and wanted food that we could depend on. 
 Subway was right there. 
 They didn't give points on our Subway Card though. 


Your standard subway. 
 Open late. 
 Quick service. 
 Vegetables were fresh. 
 This location is close to the hotel

Went here a few times over a course of 4 days while visiting Disneyland. 
 The first experience wasn't great. 
 I ordered a meatball sub. 
 they put it into the toaster and we had to yell at them cause they didn't ask and they were to busy talking Spanish behind the counter that we had to raise our voices to get.

We just wanted something that was somewhat healthy and an alternative to fast food. 
 . 
 that was a bad decision. 
 They got the order wrong on one sub so had to go back and exchange it. 
 The Ranch dressing tasted &quot. 
off&quot. 
. 
 The chicken tasted old and the lettuce was wilted. 


Nice option to have that is open 24 hours. 
 Service and food were good. 
 Close to many different hotels in the area. 
 Right on the corner of Katella & Harbor. 


great seeing them build me my own sandwich plus its healthy. 
 So close to the parks and the hotel i was staying at. 
 So convenient for me and my family. 


Stopped here in the afternoon on the way back to the hotel. 
 The food was fresh and good. 
 though higher priced than a usual Subway. 
 They did not offer free ice water. 
 you had to buy the bottled stuff if you wanted water. 


Subway close to Disney. 
 Can't go wrong for the price. 
 Not too far to walk especially as many people pass it on the way to their hotel. 


Typical Subway fare. 
 Decent prices. 
 Quick service. 
 Something for the whole family. 
 We go there every trip to Disneyland. 


Staff was very personable and quick service. 
 Prices are great. 
 Perfect place to eat when you don't want to eat a heavy meal. 


Great economic meals. 
 Stopped a few times to pick up sandwiches to eat at Disneyland. 
The staff were very friendly. 


for a simple healthy food. 
 Subway was our daily stop for lunch. 
 Disneyland park food just does not have healthy choice at an affordable price

This location is open 24hours and it has a friendly staff. 
 Location is excellent near the Disney property. 
 I was there during off hours and didn't wait long at all

It's just another standard Subway with their known menu. 
 however restaurant is really small and they don't have bathrooms. 


We often stop here to get lunch before heading to Disneyland or California Adventure for the day. 
 Its never crowded. 


Subway is Subway. 
 I've been to a lot worse. 
 This one was clean and very comfortable. 
 The employees were friendly and even gave us information about the events going on in Downtown Disney. 
 They were very helpful and fun. 
 Food is just like every other Subway. 
 which is fresh and made to order. 
 Enjoy. 


This location shines in the SoCal sun. 

Staff is fantastic ~ getting customers thru at lightning speed. 

Being Vegetarian. 
 this is a Great place to Eat Fresh. 
 They made me a 'veggie pizza sub' no problem. 
 even tho it's not on the menu & at $5 for a footlong. 
 the price can't be beat. 
 *includes tax. 

Couldn't count how many.

Reliable and inexpensive for Dinner. 
 Standard subway open 24. 
7. 

We enjoyed our dinner and free cookies for completing the survey on line. 


It is conveniently located on the corner of katella and harbour. 
 they were fast and friendly. 
 The store was clean . 
 not a lot of seating area. 


being close to Disneyland you would expect inflated prices. 
 . 
 not so. 
 The are at the far corner of harbor and Katella so a walk depending on what hotel you are at . 
 worth the walk if you are tired of overpriced junkfood. 


2 large foot longs fed our young family of 6 (2 adults. 
 4 kids 11. 
 9. 
 6. 
 & 3) along with a two liter of pop from the 7-11 around the corner. 
 Subway food quality. 
 great prices. 


The staff were friendly. 
 especially the guy on the cashier. 
 he was superb. 
 really made an effort to speak to you and thank you for your patronage. 
 Thanks heaps. 


A nice lunch break from the park. 
 Sandwiches were good. 
 Place was clean and the staff was nice and friendly. 


Had lunch here one day and it was so nice to eat a sandwich. 
 filled roll for a change instead of a cooked meal. 


We love Subway because we can share a footlong & there are always monthly specials plus lots of choices as well. 
. 
. 
built to our specifications. 


It's so nice after a long day in the Disney parks to have something semi-healthy to offer the family. 
 The service was quick and the prices were just like home. 
 They could have charged more simply because every other business around this location does. 
 . 
 not this Subway. 
 Thank you for helping this family out. 


Wanted something to eat one night. 
. 
. 
everywhere the prices were inflated. 
 because of the location. 
 Not this Subway. 
 Good quick service and regular prices. 
 No wonder it was crowded. 


This subway was excellent it saw 24 hours open just across our hotel desert Palm hotels the service was fantastic food was great

Tired. 
 and didn't want to go to a restaurant. 
 So we ordered our sandwiches as Subway. 
 just around the corner from our hotel. 
 and so we enjoyed our dinner in our room. 
 relaxing after a very long day at the parks. 


The food in subway is fresh. 
 pocket friendly and tasty. 
 You get a chance to actually make your own sandwich. 


Convenient location. 
 This is within walking distance to several hotels. 
 and I bought breakfast sandwiches there instead of the expensive hotel breakfast

Subway was located close to our hotel so we took advantage of this and ate there most days. 
 either brunch before we entered the park or a late lunch around 3pm after leaving the park. 
 The food was always good and the service (once we hot used to the American way of doing things and the different menu) was always.

location was great considering our hotel was nearby. 
 Employee making our sandwiches was not so great. 
 He could hardly keep his eyes open for whatever reason and I had to repeat my simple order multiple times. 

Cashier charged me full price for beverages that I asked to be included in combo meals. 
 Wasn't even worth the effort to get it.

The bread was slightly stale. 
 . 
 other than that it was a totally what you would expect at a Subway. 


Awesome for cheap and quick breakfast before heading to Disneyland. 
 Open 24 hours. 
 Super expensive. 
 no problem with service. 
 clean and friendly. 


On your way to Disneyland. 
 pack a lunch and save money. 
 This was an average Subway restaurant with the perfect location about 8 minutes from Disneyland's Main Gate. 


After spending too much for breakfast at the hotel. 
 we stopped by Subway on the way to the park on day two. 
 The prices were reasonable and the sandwich was better than I expected. 
 This was my first time having Subway for breakfast. 
 I would do this again on another visit. 


We eat at subway all the time. 
 so food was as expected. 
 a bit heavy on ranch sauce. 
 Told me they did not have a cup of water available. 
 Was told later unlawful in CA to refuse water to customers. 
 Mmmm. 
. 
. 


Subway is always a great choice when you are in a hurry. 
 We did miss not having the option of carrot though. 
 which is an Aussie staple. 


Across the street from the Candy Cane Inn. 
 Always good. 
 Get a coupon in a map brochure at the front desk. 


I like subway. 
 These subs are fresh and healthy. 
 . 
 for my personal preference. 
 Togo's is the way to go. 


Subway is my top choice for quick fast food. 
 Best $5 sandwich anywhere. 
 My favorite bread is the 9 grain honey oat. 


Great sandwiches and drinks. 
 Some subways a good and some are duds. 
 this one was good. 
 The only downside is that the employees. 
 all 3 of them. 
 looked and acted like they didnt want to be there and this was around noon. 
 Very Very tiny sitting area that gets crowed and over packs the store. 


This is a great Subway and we found a good cheesesteak we liked. 
 Best way to go for 2 people is to share a large one. 
 Make sure to ask them to put on the sauces and condiments you like - they have a lot of options. 
 We took our food out. 
 . 
 there is seating there. 


We visited the Subway Sandwich shop and the staff was very polite. 
 fast and helpful. 
 The veggies were fresh and so was the bread. 
. 
. 
a very good sandwich. 
 Would go back next time we are out there. 


A familiar and friendly spot to stop. 
 in a convenient location near a bus stop. 
 They had the usual fresh ingredients that we are used to in Canada. 


If you need a quick and cheap snack. 
 this is the place . 
 don't expect much to choose from particularly warm food. 


You really can't go wrong with Subway. 
 . 
 this place deserves a mention because it's crazy busy and the service is still efficient and friendly. 
 There's not much seating there. 
 so it's probably a good idea to plan to take your food with you. 
 This is a great alternative to Disney food - fresh and at a reasonable price.

Fresh sandwich toppings. 
 home made bread and reliable quality. 
 Can't go wrong with this choice. 
 Prices here are also very reasonable considering the cost of eating at Disney restaurants. 
 A great option for a quick and healthy meal. 


Very dependable everywhere. 
 No bad surprises. 
 Fresh is what they advertise. 
 & fresh & clean it is. 
 A welcome nutritious selection. 


During our eight week world tour. 
 we have relied on Subway in so many countries for a feed. 
 This store was no exception. 
 The store was clean. 
 the quality was as it should have Ben and the staff were fantastic. 
 The store does lack seating. 
 . 
 we were returning to our hotel room for the feed. 
 so it was not.

Close to hotel and open late. 
 I think it's actually open 24 hrs. 
 Good price. 
fresh avocados. 
 Tomatoes could have been fresher though. 
 But pretty good. 


Friendly service and fresh food. 
 There wasn't enough places for people to sit down. 
 Other than that it was ok. 


Good sandwiches. 
busy. 
long lines. 
small store. 
the best thing was that it was right across the street from our hotel. 
Love subway. 


Only drawback was slow service. 
 Not enough employees working for the amount of people. 
 The sandwiches were fresh and the cookies were hot out of the oven. 
 Yum. 


Just like what Subway says Eat Fresh . 
 Great sandwiches . 
 Healthy eating . 
 They make eating sandwiches a delightful experience. 


We took the train up to Anaheim and we were hungry when we got off the train. 
 We split a turkey sub. 
 toasted. 
 with fresh veggies and it was a great way to start our fueling for a Disney day

This is one of the best subways it was next to are hotel which was great and the service was great it was busy . 
 the line just went quickly and the sandwichs are great and everybody was nice. 


Its your typical Subway. 
 just happier because of its proximity with disneyland. 
 Average Subway though. 


Short walk from the convention center. 
 that walk is quick and its gorgeous outside. 
 Good point to break from the madness at the convention center. 
 and grab something somewhat healthy to go. 


We are all on a diet. 
 and were trying to stick to it on vacation. 
 so this is a good inexpensive place for the family to eat healthy. 


They moved the line along well and asked the right questions. 
 No mistakes made on my orders there. 
 Cheap option for families heading to the parks. 


Great place to grab sandwiches if you're not eating at a restaurant . 
 need something to bring back to your room to eat. 


We order sandwiches for dinner to take into Disneyland. 
 The employee working that night marked our sandwiches as mom. 
 dad. 
 etc. 
 Made it easy to tell who's sandwich was who's. 
 Great service. 


Everyday during our Disney vacation we'd head back the hotel for a break and get some lunch at the nearby Subway. 
 This is a typical Subway that offers great alternative to over price food in the park. 
 We'd get some extra cookies to bring with us into Disneyland for snacks. 


We were visiting Disneyland for 3 days and looking for an inexpensive dinner option before we headed back to the park. 
 My kids were very psyched to find the stripmall with Subway. 
 Greek food and Chinese food. 
 Everyone got something different and was very happy. 
 Staff at Subway was friendly and fast. 
 Highly recommend if you are looking for an.

Attentive staff. 
 Also liked the fact that they changed gloves for each set of customers - felt good being a vegetarian. 


We grabbed sandwiches after a long day at Disneyland. 
It wasn't too crowded and it was quick. 
 clean and across the street from our hotel. 
 It's a typical subway so you know what to expect. 


We have 4 kids and the staff was very patient and efficient when the kids ordered their sandwiches. 
 They had patience with them and were very nice.

Prompt service. 
 good sandwiches and good prices make this a great place for a quick lunch. 
 The restaurant was clean and well-run. 
 I would eat here again. 


We bought lunch here before leaving to drive back home from Disneyland. 
 The prices were so good in comparison to what we had been paying in the parks all week. 
 The bread. 
 meats. 
 and vegetables to make the sandwiches were perfect to eat a healthy meal in the car.
