My son went back to school today. 
 . 
 wanted to visit his favorite place before he left. 
 Our server was Evelyn. 
 and she was on point. 
 We have been visiting Mr. 
 BBQ for over a year. 
 the food is always good. 
 . 
 service is either hit or miss. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
Today service and food was direct hit. 
 So thanks for a bitter sweet.

Came for my daughters Birthday Party after seeing the great reviews on Yelp. 
 Had to wait approximately an hour to get in the door (not to bad). 
 They do not take reservations. 
 However. 
 if you can. 
 stop by here and hour early. 
 put your name on the list. 
 and come back. 
.

This restaurant is not vey big. 
 and was packed when.

Great food. 
 . 
 be prepared for an extremely long wait to get a table. 
 Also dress in comfortable clothes for 2 reasons - 1) if you do it right you'll be absolutely stuffed. 
 and 2) it is always very warm in the restaurant. 


My coworker suggested I go here while in town and I'm glad she did. 
 The food was SO good. 
 We mainly got the bulgogi and tried some other stuff I don't remember. 
 . 
 they were good too. 
 You get free ice cream at the end so that's a nice touch. 
 I didn't like all the clanking from the workers cleaning.

We weren't sure we were gonna be able to fit Mr. 
 BBQ into our schedule. 
 suffice to say that we're glad we did. 
 We opted for a weekday lunch at this AYCE (all you can eat) figuring it would not be as busy and that we would avoid a too-long wait plus one in our party would not be able.

Lots of sides to choose from. 

Consistently good. 

Wonderful service. 

A small scoop of ice cream at the end the meal. 


We have visited this place 3 times in just a couple of months. 
 Our family enjoyed it so much. 
 The staffs are very friendly. 
 So many choices of food. 
 The price is right. 


We picked this place because we had a Korean student traveling with us. 
 She hadn't eaten a 'home- cooked' meal since studying in the US for several months. 
 She was overjoyed with our great find. 
 We were all loving the great food. 
 indeed. 
 I think we finally rolled out of the restaurant two hours later. 
 TIP. 
. 
. 
get there early. 
 I don't.

Came on a Friday evening around 5:30pm. 
 and it was around a 30 minute wait. 
 We got the $23. 
99 dinner All You Can Eat. 

This place apparently only has tables of 6. 
 so the two of use were confused when we got to a table of 6. 
 . 
 the waiter said it was alright. 
 Started off with Brisket and pork.

Tried on a whim. 
 So glad our other place was closed for remodel. 
 Service attentive and hospitable. 
 So many choices. 
 Kimchi varieties great . 
 my favorite the cucumber. 
 Ate beef tongue for first time. 
 Not bad. 
 Good portion. 
 fair price. 
 Totally coming back. 
 I'm so full I will have to walk dogs again tonight. 
 Yummy

We had dinner for my 50th birthday celebration and we were all amazed with the service from the staff. 
 the food were awesomely delicious. 
 They sang and danced as the staff sing a happy birthday song. 
 Will come back soon and extremely highly recommended. 
 The wait was long . 
 definitely worth it. 
 You will not regret. 


Mr. 
 BBQ-Well so much has been said. 
 . 
 I had to add to it. 
 My husband took me and our daughter here today for my belated birthday dinner at Mr. 
 BBQ. 
 Korean BBQ turned out to be a truly fun (and totally filling) experience. 
 And this spot has incredible meats and seriously AMAZING waitstaff. 

The standard PAYCE on weekends is.

We've been to a lot of Korean BBQs in OC. 
 Usually the service is poor or the quality of the meat is poor or the atmosphere is poor. 
 But not here. 

They really deserve a high national ranking. 
 I'm not sure about #27 in the country on Yelp. 
 But they deserve a high ranking. 
 Is it better than Per Se?.

What a great experience. 
 Not a cheap date. 
 . 
 a great meal. 
 If you've never been to Korean BBQ before. 
 don't be scared. 
 The servers are excellent and will help you through those first time jitters. 
 The food just keeps coming. 
 Sides were delicious. 
 Meats were even better. 

Special shout out to our server. 
 Jenny.

Picked this place because of ratings. 
 Yup. 
 agree with the ratings. 
 Excellent food . 
 and even my picky daughter and wife eat happily. 
 Be ready for a very long long looooog wait though. 
 We waited for 90mins before e got a place. 
 Wait would be difficult . 
 . 
 in our case was worth it. 
 Must try at least once

For a party of 4 we were told it would be 45-60 min and waited for almost 2 hours. 
 Once we sat we took our time since we were so hungry . 
 I enjoyed my first korean bbq experience. 
 The food was tasty. 
 all the sides were good. 
 All you can eat for $22. 
99 is pretty darn good. 
 We ordered.

This is a super cheap bbq placed owned by Koreans. 
 It's good and cheap meat - unlimited. 
 But if you're looking for a &quot. 
korean&quot. 
 bbq experience. 
 this isn't the place. 

Two items that we ordered that I don't recommend are the baby squid and gopchang (small intestines). 

Definitely order the black Angus. 


Excellent food with a large array of pickled vegetables and numerous meats to choose from. 
 Service is fast and friendly and prices are reasonable. 
 Try it once and you'll want to return for more. 


I can only echo everything that has already been said. 
 Amazing service. 
 excellent food. 
 outstanding value. 
 etc. 
. 
 etc. 
. 
 etc. 
. 
. 
 We had the best time at Mr BBQ and I highly recommend you check it out. 
 Just like everyone else says. 
 however. 
 there typically is a wait so just plan on that happening. 


For about $20 per person you can get the All Your Can eat mid range menu offering. 
 There is so much to pick from you will not go hungry. 
 The staff is great. 
 and the restaurant is spotless. 
 I am giving this place 5 stars even though I am cooking my own food.

We went to Mr. 
 BBQ with our daughter and some friends for lunch. 
 This was our first experience of Korean barbecue and we thoroughly enjoyed it. 
 The quality and the variety of meats is impressive. 
 Even when they are cooked well done. 
 they are amazingly tender. 
 The acompanying small salads and condiments perfectly balance the richness of the meats.

Went to Mr. 
 BBQ since it was recommended by a local Korean resident. 
 Wanted to do dinner originally . 
 there's a line. 
 So ended up going for lunch the next day. 
 There's lunch special . 
 we opt for the all you can eat. 
 Love the beef belly. 
 Bulgogi and pork ribs are good. 
 too. 
 They even have a special serving.

Quality meats and I love all the sides that come with the BBQ. 
 if you run out of something they are right there to bring more. 
 No reservations - means LONG wait times for a table at busy times. 
 Servers are great. 
 once you get seated. 
 Atmosphere is a bit hectic (neon lights. 
 pop music) . 
 makes for a fun.

This is an all-you-can-eat BBQ place. 
 That being said. 
 the meat you get is well above the quality you get at other comparable restaurants AND they brought new ones quickly. 
 Lot's of side dishes for you to enjoy. 

We went at around 5:00 and were able to be seated immediately.

 by the time we left the lobby and outside.

 scallops. 
 Waygu beef.

Cool place and very clean. 
 I like that they give you new grill tops often since they do get dirty. 
 Our server Mina was AWESOME. 
 I am very picky about my meats and she helped find a meat with less fat and a texture I would like. 
 Success. 
 Mina found something. 
 She made the whole experience so enjoyable. 
 Bravo to.

I finally found an AYCE KBBQ down the street from home. 
 We arrived right before 6pm and there was no wait. 
 Our server. 
 Michael. 
 was friendly. 
 provided excellent service (changed our grill at least 5 times. 
) and was just all-around awesome. 
 They have a pretty good meat selection and plenty of sides for $20. 
99 a person. 
 And.

 they have vanilla.

We celebrated my wife's birthday at this restaurant and had a great time. 
 If you've never been to a Korean BBQ place you need to try it at least once. 

They bring the marinated meats out to you and you cook it on your table with the built-in grills attached. 
 The food smells so good while they are being cooked.

4 1. 
2 stars. 
 First time visit and on a Thursday for lunch. 
 Price increased to $14. 
99 a person for AYCE. 
 The interior is modern and comfy even though it was hot outside. 
 We were seated asap and brought a bottle of filtered drinking water. 
 banchan and salad. 

Even with the price increase there was a solid selection of beef. 
 pork.

There used to be another very average Korean restaurant here. 
 The new owner remodeled and had a grand opening about 6 months ago. 
 I did not look on-line for the review . 
 decided to try it last week for a quick lunch. 
 The meat was really fresh and service was good. 
 We went back again yesterday as a family and.
