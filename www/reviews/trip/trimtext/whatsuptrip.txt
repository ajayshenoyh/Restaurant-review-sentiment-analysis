Always good. 
 Chuka Soba (chicken broth ramen) with a side of Kimchi rice is the norm for us
The karaage chicken is good. 
 We have never had a bad meal here

This was my family's first time to this ramen place. 
 First of all. 
 the prices are fair. 
 The portions are good and the ramen isn't too salty. 
 That's an issue with some of the ramen places I've been to before. 
 There are plenty of spices and stuff ok the table that we can add to enhance the flavored to taste.

This is a small place near Cal State Fullerton. 
 This is authentic Japanese noodle dishes. 
 This is the type of place that you would find in the small towns of Japan. 
 Good food. 
 very reasonable prices. 
 Beside their delicious noodle dishes. 
 they have katsu and curry and other dishes. 


This is really a little hole in the wall type restaurant neat CSUF. 
 that my daughter and I tried out. 
 If you like Pho. 
 then you will really like this place. 
 as it is similar with a Japanese twist. 
 The food is fresh. 
 and made right in front of you sushi bar style. 
 Very friendly and happy staff. 
 This place.

My frequent trips to Pieology got me curious about this ramen establishment that was always buzzing next door. 
 I found them to be the most popular of ramen places in a 20 miles radius (even though there's only two others). 
 So. 
 I checked them out. 

Having been here a handful of times. 
 I can confidently say the ramen is pretty.

I was delightfully surprised when we walked into What's Up. 
. 
. 
I always pass by and thought it was just a pay up front place and when we walked in. 
 it was a cute. 
 small sit down restaurant with nice seating and really authentic food and real Japanese chefs. 
 Lots of ramen to choose from. 
 really fast service. 
 and a huge line.

After eating at so many &quot. 
Asian&quot. 
 restaurants. 
 it's nice to find a Japanese ramen shop that is truly Japanese. 
 Fusion can be fine. 
 . 
 I like my ramen Japanese rather than Japanese-ish style. 
 The shoyu ramen was tasty. 
 and the noodles had a nice texture that was neither &quot. 
al dente&quot. 
 nor squishy. 
 There was a decent crowd waiting when we.

I stopped in to get a take out order and was greeted by a friendly staff. 
 I ordered some ramen and pot stickers and they were very good. 
 The food came out quickly and I took it home to eat it about 1. 
2 hour later. 
 It was still delicious. 
 I will be back. 


The broth here is the best-ever. 
 It is rich and homemade. 
 You'll really enjoy this on a cold rainy night. 
 The guys that work here are hardworking and put out a great product. 


The place is tiny. 
 so don't expect to have a huge party here. 
 Located next door to Pieology is this ramen place. 
 Its not the best in Orange County. 
 . 
 I'm sure there's worse. 
 To me. 
 its ok. 
 I wasn't terribly disappointed. 
 . 
 I can't say that this is the first place I'll think of for ramen. 
 when there's so.

 The ramen broth is nice and rich. 
 fatty. 
 milky.

 the best part is that it is open late at night. 
 It wasn't too crowded . 
 isn't geared for groups of more than 4. 
 Its a little restaurant so if you plan on visiting with.

I have been looking for a good Ramen place since the one in San Diego closed. 
 I was in Fullerton on Business and I stopped in for a quick lunch. 
 Best noodles that I have had in years. 
 service was quick and the staff was very friendly. 


This ramen is amazing. 
 The noodles have a great bite not soggy. 
 The soup is excellent (the spicy miso. 
 the aka. 
 is yummy). 
 The gyosa is thin. 
 crispy on the bottom and so good. 
 The service and atmosphere are always great. 
 I've been to a few ramen houses in tokyo and &quot. 
Whats up Ramen&quot. 
 is the real deal. 

It can.

I was introduced to this newly establishment by my friend who lives in neighborhood. 
 I was told that it has been just six months this place was opened. 
 . 
 it became very popular quick casual dinning joint for locals. 
 It is hidden in the corner of the shopping strip and the size is not so large. 
 Including counter seats. 
 30-40.
