Sort of like a Subway for pizza. 
 You chose your toppings and the pizza is made in front of you. 
 The pizza was good and the beer selection for a small pizza joint was excellent. 
 Quiet enough while I was there to have a conversation. 


I love the thin crust and unlimited toppings. 
 Ingredients are very fresh. 
 My husband got a craft beer and I ordered a cider. 
 Really great meal and affordable. 


My wife and I decided to try Pizza Press last Sunday and we have mixed feelings about our experience. 
 The staff are friendly and knowledgeable . 
 they are so cheap with the toppings that you literally have to keep asking. 
 &quot. 
can I have more sauce? Can I get more tomatoes?&quot. 
 Etc. 
 I think it's weird that they count out 6.
