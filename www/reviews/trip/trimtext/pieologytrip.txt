I love Piology. 
 I love the concept. 
 and they do a great job getting all of the requested ingredients on that pizza dough. 
 I have always gone with the pick-from-the-ingredients kind of pizza and not from the menu pizzas. 
 and I find that one pizza is enough to share. 
 I have seen others put away a whole pizza on their.

Looking for somewhere new to eat. 
 so we thought we'd try Pieology. 
 The staff was friendly and helpful. 
 The pizza was great. 
 you get to choose whatever you want. 
 and the results are amazing. 
 I've told as many people as I can about this place. 
 Go there. 


Love being able to select EVERYTHING on you pie for the same price. 
 From the type of sauce to anything for toppings. 
 Mix & match. 
 type of crust. 
 5 types of sauce which can be mixed. 
 Don't like the open industrial building. 
 makes it TOO loud. 
 Usually 1 pie will make 2 meals. 
 EXTREMELY fast service. 


What a great concept and such fun. 
 plus I made a great pizza. 
 How can you not like a place where you build you own pizza and they have everything that you could possibly want on a pizza. 
 Great service. 
 clean restaurant. 
 and fun. 
 As you que up in line. 
 all of your choices are right there before you get.

Have enjoyed this. 
 its just good thin crush fresh pizza. 
 You go through the line choose what you want from sauce to cheese to veggies and meats. 
 It is just good. 


I was hesitant to go to Pieology. 
 Lakewood due to some previous poor reviews. 
 But I was invited with friends. 
and was thrilled to enjoy a clean restaurant. 
 ac working fine in 100 degree weather. 
 and friendly help for a first timer in making my pizza. 
 Prices are very reasonable. 
 and I will return often. 
 I had the wheat crust.

This place is by far the best new pizzeria in town. 
 At times it can be crowded . 
 WELL WORTH THE WAIT. 
 Heres the skinny: 11. 
5&quot. 
 pizza (size of a dinner plate). 
 unlimited toppings (including gourmet ones like artichoke. 
 bbq chicken. 
 etc) you pick your pizza crust. 
 sauces and all topping all for a great price of $8. 
95. 
 Now.

You design your own pizza. 
 selecting from dozens of cheeses. 
 veggies. 
 and meats. 
 It's all 1 price so you can pile it on. 
 Take out or eat in. 
 free refills on the drinks. 


When you're in the mood for good individual pizzas. 
 pieology is the place. 
 The concept is awesome and the pizzas are actually good. 
 Not the best deal when feeding a large family. 
 . 
 awesome for lunch. 


this is one of those build it yourself pizza places. 
 It's designed to provide an individual size pizza with made to order toppings. 
 Had a little trouble understanding the concept because I'm used to being charged for each topping. 
 Here it's unlimited toppings for veggies. 
 meats. 
 and others. 
 Doesn't take long to get the pizza made and cooked easy for.

It seemed like no matter what you ordered. 
 the price was the same for all pizzas. 
 Many kinds to try. 
 or make your own. 
 Our party did two standards. 
 and two create your owns. 
 The pie crusts are just larger than and individual size. 
 are tasty. 
 and amply stacked with ingredients. 
 The buffalo chicken pizza has a spicy buffalo sauce.

Thought I'd give this a shot since I got a coupon in the mail. 
 and it was close to my work. 

I called ahead to order. 
 . 
 they said they didn't take orders over the phone. 
 I hesitated. 
 . 
 still had plenty of time for lunch. 
 so I decided to still give it a try. 

The store is set up.
