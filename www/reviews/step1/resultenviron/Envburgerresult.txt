 who discovered this great gourmet burger place near Fullerton College. 
We have been going to this burger place for years. 
We stopped here for dinner one night thinking it would be only a burger place. 
 This is a walk up and order place with food brought to you. 
I really enjoyed dining at this place. 
Heard about this place from a friend and decided to try it. 
 For basically a fast food place the prices are way out of line. 
I love hamburgers and this place knows how to do them. 
I can't tell you how happy I was to find this place. 
 Friendly staff and very clean place. 
Wonderful place and great food. 
 Downtown Fullerton is lots of fun and this place is a fabulous addtion to the city. 
This place is great. 
 It's a busy place . 
 it is a great causal place to get a really great gourmet style burger. 
While trying to decide where to eat we figured since this place is packed we might as well try it. 
Let me say that the service at this places de me feel very welcomed. 
The place has great atmosphere with the big windows open to downtown Fullerton and the old brick structure. 
My husband and I had just attended an organ concert at Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton and were looking for a good place to eat. 
 this place should close immediately what a terrible franchise to allow this to happen. 
 and kindly said she was sorry it took long and that for my patience she placed a bag or newly hot fries (small) for my troubles. 
Place is hot inside and dirty. 
 this place has no air-conditioning even though their rude manager. 
 if you're hungry and don't have a lot of time there are worse places you could stop for a bite.
