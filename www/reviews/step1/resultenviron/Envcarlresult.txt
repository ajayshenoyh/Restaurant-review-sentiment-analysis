Literally the worst service I've ever gotten. I never post reviews and I had to for this place. Awful. 
 this place can go from either jam-packed to half full. 
 this place gets it's good haul of customers. 
 one of the big ups about this place is how friendly everyone is. 
  It's not that this place is just that good. 
 There are a number of other places on campus for coffee lovers to get that cup of java and this Carl's Jr is one you should avoid. 
The most commonly ordered items are made in advance and placed under heat lamps. 
  I hate this place. 
This is the only place I've ever had trouble paying for something with my debit card. 
 there are better places a short walk around the corner. 
 The place is pretty clean for the most part and the price is obviously great. 
I only give 5 stars to places that blow me away. 
 Leaps and bounds better than the place in Orange.
