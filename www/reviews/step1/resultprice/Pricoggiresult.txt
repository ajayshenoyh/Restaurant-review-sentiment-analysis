 The garlic parmesan fried chicken was too greasy and I think the quality was not worth the price. 
 Pretty small portion for its given price. 
Salad cons: small for price. 
 Cutting down portion sizes while charging the same high price is what runs customers off. 
 the pizza prices are kind of pricey -- it's probably because it's near CSUF. 
 it cost $4 an hour during the week BUT OGGI'S VALIDATES parking so don't worry. 
 is only free for a half hour normally and then skyrockets in price to a ridiculous rate of $4 for 31 minutes to the first hour. 
Prices are high for the quality. 
  The wings were a very good size for the price. 
 service and prices need to be improved. 
 Is this a way for them to justify the price? We ordered a 14" of the Oggi's special and man was there a lot of crust. 
 Costco. 
 fairly priced. 
 and the beer is priced decently. 
 The bartender even acknowledged that it was pricey and that she should validate my ticket "just in case" - which I thought was good service. 
 Totally not worth the cost and the good was not good. 
  Price was very reasonable given there was six of us.

 Prices were reasonable. 
Costco's pizza is better. 
 those 6 wings cost about $15.
