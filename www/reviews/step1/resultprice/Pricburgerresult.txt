the big problem cones in at the price. 
 way too pricey. 
Pricey . 
 For basically a fast food place the prices are way out of line. 
 not for the price. 
A bit overpriced for the serving size. 
Good fast food, good prices and good choice in combos. Need to be more clean and organized.
 and it was more expensive then what I ordered. 
 its the same price.
