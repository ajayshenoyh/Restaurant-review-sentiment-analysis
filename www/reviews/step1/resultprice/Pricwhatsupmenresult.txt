 the prices are fair. 
 very reasonable prices. 
I love this place. It has good ramen and the service and prices are fair. Come in during lunch for lunch special. 
Ramen that will blow your mind and they are open late. Everything is delicious and prices are great.Love coming here with friends when I'm near Cal State.
Their seared pork is absolutely amazing and I order it every time. Quick service and attentive staff. Very reasonably priced! I prefer this place over Kopan Ramen because the prices are better and you don't have to order every ingredient separately. 
 At least the price and service was good. 
 great prices. 
 Great portions and good price. 
I'm surprised that a place that prices about $8 a bowl is this good. 
For the portion size I thought it was a little overpriced.
