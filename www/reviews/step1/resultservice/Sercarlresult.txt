 service was nice and quick. 
 Fast service. 
 Even when there were 10 people in line there was only one till open and staff wandered around slowly. 
 Staff was right in front of us . 
 Staff was really friendly. 
 It was accompanied by a very good service. 
 All the members of the staff were attentive. 
 and treat every customer with respect and friendliness which makes a difference in the fast food service. 
 This place is good for quick bites and has a very friendly staff. 
 The staff is friendly and the dining area is well kept. 
Service is eh and Carl's overall marketing campaign I don't appreciate.
Fast service for the amount of traffic, go to if you're on campus and need a quick snack 
Literally the worst service I've ever gotten. I never post reviews and I had to for this place. Awful. 
I have never experienced the negative experiences with customer services others have had. 
 The service is not very good either. 
 The manager tries to appear friendly and professional . 
 what do you expect from a customer service job? Guess the entire staff puts up with it because they need the money because I can't see them doing the job for fun. 
Pros: Fast service before 11:30. 
  I can't reverse the service charge so it doesn't matter anymore. 
 worst customer service ever. 
 muttering that it didn't work until a manager (the one short lady with the unnaturally high bangs) smugly goes. 
  They always have great consistent service. 
Customer Service: 5. 
Fast service by pleasant people. 
for THIS kind of service we're supposed to support the idea of $15 per hour for fast food employees? this was a service disaster
t service from the awful girl at the window?
 the service has gotten progressively worse since the re-opening and I think I'll take the time to drive to the Rose Drive location the next time we get a Carl's craving.
