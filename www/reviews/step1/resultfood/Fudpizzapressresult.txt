I came here out of curiosity at first, and now it's one of my more regular places to eat. The location and atmosphere is interesting and pleasant, the service is good, and of course the pizza is delicious. With plenty of choices and the ability to create your own pizza for a great price, this makes coming back to try different combinations utterly worth it. That being said, if there is one thing I'm not sold on, it's the way the pizza is given to the customer if you don't ask for a to-go box. The pizza is placed on a wooden peel after it is cooked (a wooden peel is basically a flat wooden board with tapered sides and a handle that's usually used to stick certain types of pizza into an oven) and the customer is given that to use as the plate.  While it does look rather stylish and is pretty unique, this truthfully just comes off as clunky at best and really awkward to carry at worst. Not only do you have to worry about potentially dropping it or mosquitoes from outside, but this also means the pizza itself is getting colder faster. Plus it also makes getting a drink if your alone much more difficult since you either have to worry about dropping it while getting a drink or leaving it back at your table where anyone could take it/touch it. It's never happened yet, but  weird things do happen. Maybe this is supposed to be environmentally friendly or something, but Needless to say, I always ask for a to-go box. Overall, a great place for quick and delicious pizza, with a rather odd and awkward bit that I'm not sold on.
Build your own pizza with local breweries on tap. Driving through tonight we stopped in by chance and liked it. Very clean, curious, friendly and helpful employees. Liked the food, beer and atmosphere.
 Then guy has us pay and asks if we want drinks. 
 So I got my girlfriend and I two regular drinks. 
 So we're like ok maybe we get our drinks when we get our pizza. 
 We had to ask another guy for the drinks because the other guy was talking to the girl working. 
  They gave us a free drink for a Yelp check-in and would stop by our table to check up on us. 
  If you enjoy drinking beer while eating pizza. 
 There's a subtle taste of garlic. 
 beverages (includes fountain drinks. 
 Check in on Yelp to redeem a free soft drink. 
 let's break down the food. 
  Don't forget to check in on yelp to receive a free fountain drink with your pizza as well. 
 I enjoyed the food. 
 Especially because my mom spilled her drink all over the floor. 
  The pepperoni tastes better here. 
  They should have someone who handle the money and not handle the food as well. 
 the food itself just wasn't doing it for me. 
 tasted more creamy than I was expecting for a pasta salad. 
All that being said about the food and beer. 
# The lines are long during lunch time because they're really new. 
 the most beer-friendly and stereotypical food item. 
# The pizza here makes for a decent lunch. 
 Each personal pizza is a good size that's plenty for lunch. 
 A wider variety of options (both food and drank) make it a little more desirable than its bajillion competitors. 
The food is still great. 
Food was pretty bomb though. 
 They even reminded me of the free drink I could get when I checked in on Yelp. 
What makes this place so good is that it is so fresh and you can taste the quality. 
 the food is great. 
CRUST - Winner: Pizza Press - Something about it just makes the pizza's taste profile better. 
CHEESE - Winner: Pieology - I think the cheese at Pieology tastes better. 
VEGGIES: Pieology's veggies seem to taste more fresh (may be because of the way they're baked). 
 you will get a lot of food. 
OVERALL TASTE: Pizza Press. 
 and I don't feel like I'm in a food coma afterwards. 
 I'm not a drinker. 
 so go drink on your own and find out. 
 I was very satisfied with the food with great customer service as well. 
 I can't finish a ton of food. 
 The taste was very good. 
But how this place beats out Pieology and Blaze is is the cheese is put on better and tastes better. 
 the pizza is too dry for my taste. 
 it still tastes good. 
 Amazing how great it tasted. 
Now to the actual food. 
 couldn't really taste anything else on it and the dipping sauce was ehh. 
 the taste of this pizza was much better. 
 with not super different food. 
 the guy preparing my food was only wearing gloves half the time. 
 I work with food for my job and I know how big of a no-no it is to not be wearing protective gloves when dealing with customers food. 
Overall the taste of the pizza wasn't terrible. 
 4 out of 4 music graduate students approve of the food and the beer. 
 I didn't mention a thing since I'm not one to waste food. 
The food is structured the same way as Pieology or Blaze. 
The food: nicely baked. 
god it was like drinking oil with a hint of dry dough. 
 I was amazed at how fresh the pizza still tasted. 
 the pizza from the Pizza Press tasted like it was still fresh out of the oven. 
 quality ingredients in their food which definitely stands out against places like Blaze Pizza and Pizza Studio. 
 They gave me a 15% discount for being a CSUF  student so dinner ended up being cheaper than Pieology. 
Now the food. 
 I can not taste the sauce like at all. 
 all i tasted was the cheese. 
fast customer service and the quality food. 
 The spice level was non existent and just tastes like a lot of salt.
