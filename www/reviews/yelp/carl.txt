<p itemprop="description">Always friendly, fast and my breakfast sandwich is great.  Love that it's next to my office !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">With CSUFs limited food options especially if you're only taking classes in Mihaylo, this place is a hit or miss. 

I've had a great burger from here and a down right, premade/sitting below a hot lamp burger. The quality of ingredients here is sub par to most other Carl's. 

Although it is convient, I would rather cross the street and have something else.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of the things I take serious in life is my fast food.  So serious, that I wrote a totally not serious article about the greatness that is the 4 dollar Real Deal at Carl's Jr. (More on that later)

http://foryourreadingdispleasure.weebly.com/blog/fofofo-dollar-fast-food-plus-tax

Tucked away on the campus of CSUF behind Mihaylo Hall is a Carl's Jr, my go to spot for food on campus.  Depending on when you come, this place can go from either jam-packed to half full.  Because they offer a no-sales tax policy for CSUF students, and is the onlyBurger spot on campus, this place gets it's good haul of customers.

I have never experienced the negative experiences with customer services others have had.  In fact, one of the big ups about this place is how friendly everyone is.  

Because they run busy shifts, there is a minor drop off in quality from other Carl's Jr's I've been too. It usually comes down to the food sitting under the heat lamp a bit longer, or food being not piping hot.  And, I am personally okay with that.  

As long as Carl's Jr's as a whole continues to run their 4 dollar deal and I have classes on campus and don't have food on me, this is where I'll go for my fast food fix.  Heck, I might even come here if I packed food.  It's not that this place is just that good, it's that, in general, fast food is that good to me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pros.
1. Convenient 
Cons
1. Sub par food 
2. unfriendly 

Carls. Jr. is located on campus.  While it is convenient, the food tastes terrible. Other Carl's Jr.s taste 10 times better. The service is not very good either. The workers are not very friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Location is convenient with ample seating. Service is fast and friendly but the quality of food is sub par. The fries especially are very soggy and, most times, you'll get the food that's been sitting under the heat lamps. The burgers are messy and sloppy as if they had just thrown all the ingredients into a greasy paper and crumpled them into a ball shape. They also charge $1 for soda refills and keep the soda machine behind the counter. Way to treat the college kids.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">staff over there, trys to charge more money from customers. Beware of the prices and check your bill after every purchase. This is second time, they tried to charge more from me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't come here, manager is very rude. Aside from their increased prices, it's just the standard Carl's jr. Atmosphere is terrible, oily musk floating about.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always enjoy my experience here, employees are always friendly, & service is quick. Every time during passing classes, I can count on my food to be served ASAP. Though the line is long, it moves very fast. The most I've waited for my food is a good 7-8 minutes. Definitely my new lunch spot being that I just found out that Carl's also does the "protein style" burger!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Your guys are sick you treat your customers with such kind of food i oredered a spicy chicken burger and they gave me a old one the leafs in it looks like rotten which lokks like two days old if we eat such kind of stuff we will get sick you guys are located in university you guys need to provide some quality food ..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">**Very Short Review!!**  **CSUF Location**

I don't usually go to Carl's Jr. but I was starving and I wanted to buy some fries. This location has a very LONG line because it's on campus. I just read another reviewer saying that if you show you're student I.D. we don't have to pay for tax?! Say Whaaat?! I'm going to try that next time!! 

Anyway, I needed to get to class and was afraid I'd have to wait forever but since I just ordered fries, I got my order in a jiffy. I also ordered a Snickerdoodle! I seen the advertisement while I was ordering and being a dessert freak, I couldn't resist it. It's ice cream cookie sandwich!!! Never had that before!! It was so goooooooooooood!!   :))))))))))

Just a note if you're going to order sweet potato fries, that is going to be a bit of wait because not many people order it so it's freshly made with every order.  :)

Refills are a buck and you have to get it before 30 minutes after your order. Past 30 minutes and no refills for you.  :\

Thanks for reading!  Short as promised!!  :)))

 ~**kenzie**~<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pros: It's just a short walk to the restaurant and there's quick service.

Cons: Food is very poor quality than other Carl's Jr. 3 out of 5 times most of the burgers are reheated and taste horrible. Overall quality in other fast food restaurants and in other Carl's Jr. are far superior than this one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have always been a fan of the charbroiled burgers and their breakfast menu items but the coffee served here is absolutely terrible! It is so bland that it almost has no flavor!

I believe they get stingy with the amount of coffee grinds used to prepare the coffee. It has to be in its preparation because I do not think a major food franchise like Carl's Jr would serve an inferior product. I hope the management team will start implementing improvement strategies here by sampling the coffee themselves, read these complaints and then reassess how their food and beverages are prepared. 

In the meantime, the coffee here is a real bad option. It is very unfortunate you cannot enjoy some decent coffee to go along with a breakfast burrito or a sausage & egg muffin. There are a number of other places on campus for coffee lovers to get that cup of java and this Carl's Jr is one you should avoid.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">one stars for not food-poisoning me 

Here is why the low score
You are located on a state university campus with over 38000 students already. Besides the summer break and winter break, You will never lack any customer. Forget to mentions, CSUF is the third largest state university in the California. You feel the need to put the soda machine behind the counter and charge a dollar for every refill?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm not sure why all the crappy reviews. Many are about charges for using a debit card. Uh.  Bring cash. There's an ATM machine outside if you don't have cash. Maybe if you don't have cash, you shouldn't be eating here. 

I work on campus, so I have eaten here many times over the years. It's Carl Jr.  I know what to expect. I've generally had good food, usually prepared to order. At times, between classes, for example, it can get busy. That's true anywhere. 

The selection is the same as at any CJ. So are the prices. When I don't want to go off campus, it's fine, and since I bring cash and I visit when I know it won't be busy, I am in and out fairly quickly. 

I like that now there is one feeder line for ordering, so you don't have to worry if one cashier is faster than another.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just walk in about to order. This rude lady yells we we are not taking anymore order! It's only 10 am. Very rude and annoying. It was very disappointing as there are only a few places to eat on campus.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is horrible. Place is dirty, and smells like armpits. Service is fine. Unfortunately, out of all the fast food chains, Carl's Jr. made it onto campus. Ughh, I wish it was something else. I'll take McD, Jack's, Wendys, BKs, Dels over this crap any time. I'll never come to this place ever again during my time here at CSUF. Please go away!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They are very stingy with their ranch. The worker explained you must get ur ranch from the person you ordered with. They serving now?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'll give this a two star since I like their spicy chicken sandwich, but do not order their onion rings!!! It's seriously a waste of money. Does not taste like onion rings, and the batter and onion just falls apart.. I couldn't even finish it cause it was that bad. Flavorless and a waste of money<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The last two times I've gone in my food has been either cold or not what I ordered. On both occasions business was slow, so I don't see reason for the mess up. I appreciate the worker who went and got me the correct meal but given my experience I don't plan on going back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Bit into a bone in my spicy chicken sandwich. Pic was from a snapchat i took. You cant see in the pic, but the mayo was a bit yellow. I ended up throwing it away. Would complain in store, but I was in class. Goodbye my dollar and a half. T_T I understand that spicy chickens are made in demand because they are the cheapest and best bang for the buck at CSUF, but health should be considered as well. Finding a bone probably doesn't happen alot, but that one experience killed any future visits to Carles Jr there. I'd rather just get a bag of chips at the Yum.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love the bacon thick burger, it tastes so good but I always feel sick after eating it, but they have one of the best milkshakes. I usually get a strawberry or vanilla flavor and they taste so good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The place just keeps getting worse - now they only do refills on large drinks and then only within 30 minutes - don't they realize that the cost of a refill is next to zero and the customer goodwill is probably worth more?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ehh. Campus food. If you want fresh fries- ask for no salt.It will take longer, but that way your fries will actually be warm. Some days are better than others,their food has consistency issues. Show campus ID and you don't have to pay for tax.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm sorry but this place is not good. Not sure what it is, but the food here tastes horrible compared to other Carl Jr. locations. Since it is on CSUF there is always a long line, especially during lunch time. They never messed up my order, but the quality of the food is not great. After going to this place for 6 years, I'm completely put off from eating at another Carl's Jr. in the near future.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the 2nd time they didn't give me my full order. I ordered the 5 pieces chicken, and they only gave me 3 pieces. I'd rather go to Habit Burrger across the street next time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my fourth year coming to this Carl's Jr.
Workers always seem pissed off, annoyed, or impatient. Usually it's a combination of two of the three. The manager tries to appear friendly and professional but it's been four years and I can tell her front is slowly becoming more and more obvious. She is no different than the employees in that it's obvious she hates her job and would rather be elsewhere (attitude, actions, tone of voice, etc.)

A lot of times, the students/customers don't hear their order being called which is obviously annoying for the employees, plus they have random requests or are sometimes just idiots, but then again, what do you expect from a customer service job? Guess the entire staff puts up with it because they need the money because I can't see them doing the job for fun.

The most commonly ordered items are made in advance and placed under heat lamps, fries taste slightly sour versus fries at any other Carl's Jr.s off-campus, no free refills, and you WILL get attitude or sometimes ignored outright if you try to show them your CSUF ID to get tax taken off your order. Been realizing that most students know about the discount but don't bother showing their ID in order to prevent any problems with the employees (seriously, you're in the center of a public university, basically everyone walking through the door is a student).

Tip: If you want something that hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp, order something like a six dollar burger or a premium chicken sandwich - they don't make those ahead in advance.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The worst Carl's Jr. ever.

Food sits for hours under heat lamps.
Food tastes so bad my dog won't even eat it.
Food is overpriced.

Another strikeout for CSUF dining.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I always go before the lunch rush, so it's not too bad. When they get really busy, they open a cash only line to serve you faster. They don't serve chicken before 10:30, except for the spicy chicken sandwich. I think the patties here are 150% the size of patties elsewhere. They have never given me a problem about getting sauce (BBQ, ranch) for my chicken sandwich. The manager with the funky bangs that a few reviewers have mentioned has always been courteous to everybody that I've seen her interact with.

Pros: Fast service before 11:30, no tax with student I.D., cash only line opens during busy periods for those of us that remember to have cash on hand.

Cons: 1 soda refill within 30 minutes of purchase, $1 charge for debit (all Carl's do this).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is the place to be if you don't have much time. The problem is that the food is not exactly the best. I ordered two famous stars once and one of them had essentially on layer of onion. The meat looked awful and kind of the wrong color. It's a decent deal if you have coupons, but just don't expect much for the food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">All I wanted was a quick $2 order of onion rings with ranch to snack on during my break.  The cashier rung me up and I handed her my debit card.  While I punched in my pin number, I looked at the amount and it was $3.

Me:  "Am I getting charged for using my debit card?"

Cashier:  "Yes, and we charge for ranch dressing too."

Me:  "Why didn't you tell me?  I have cash."

Cashier:  "Because we don't have to."  (with attitude)

I give her a dirty look.

Cashier:  "Anyway, it's too late.  I can't reverse the service charge so it doesn't matter anymore."  (with even more attitude)

So I continued punching in my pin number, irritated because the cashier was so rude.  I know her life must suck as a Carl's Jr. cashier, but geeeeeeeeeez, please notify your customers when you charge for extra stuff like that.  $1 is no biggie, but give us a courtesy heads up minus the attitude.  

As I walked away with my food, she added, "For future reference, choose the credit option to avoid the fee."  Uhhhhhh, thanks for the late notice asshole.  You're the one who punched in 'debit' on your screen and made me pay that unnecessary fee.

Overall, worst customer service ever.  And the onion rings weren't even hot.  They were probably sitting there forever.  I hate this place.

Oh well, I'll just pretend I donated that $1 to her college fund.  I feel better already.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Located at Cal State Fullerton, it's one of only a handful of eateries on campus. Knowing that, most of the prices have been hiked compared with other Carl's Jrs. 

Most everything is made ahead of time. Unless you order something obscure or without an ingredient (which you can't do on the outside window), what you're handed has been sitting a while. 

They also practice timed refills based on what size drink you ordered. If you get a large, you have 30 minutes to get your one free refill. Less time for smaller sizes, if you get any time at all. The approximate time you ordered is written on your cup. 

This is the only place I've ever had trouble paying for something with my debit card. Their machines are beaten, with the number pad cracked from overuse. Both times my card didn't work, they kept giving me the run-around, making me re-slide my card and enter a number, muttering that it didn't work until a manager (the one short lady with the unnaturally high bangs) smugly goes, "Tell her why" to the cashier who'll lean in and insinuate that it must not be working because I don't have money on the card. They really make a scene of it, and it ends up just wasting time and making the 20 people behind me upset that they couldn't get their soggy Super Stars fast enough. 

If you're a commuter and you either took the bus or don't want to lose your parking space, but still want to eat on campus, there are better places a short walk around the corner.

**UPDATE: They now only allow refills on large size drinks. You have 30 minutes to pound that soda before you can get another one, and depending on who's filling your order he or she might short you 10 minutes.

On the plus side, they still take off sales tax if you show them your school ID.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The only reason you should come here is for their free water and too lazy to walk to the TSU or use their restroom if you're too lazy to walk to UH<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The service (as from the reviews) is pretty decent in my opinion. You can't expect nurturing service from a chaotic Carl's Jr on campus. I go up to the counter, they take my order, they take my money, give me my food, and I'm out of there. What is there to complain about?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is on the CSUF campus. I went there for a educational seminar during their spring break so all the students were gone. Service at this Carls is slow. No drink refills WTH?! They were stingy with french fries too. This Carls sucks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The lady who was supposed to take our order just stood there off to the side. After waiting for 10+ minutes we left. Fail.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">located at csuf and unlike the two togo's on campus it has much higher prices and no refills unless you pay extra. 

avoid<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the worst restaurant on the CSUF campus. Its also the worst carls jr ive ever been to. The service sucks ass. The first time i went there, I placed an order for my boyfriend and I and after I received the order, I went back up to the front to ask for water.  The worker I asked said I needed to go back to the person who helped me with my order and I could only receive one cup of water.  So i went back to the person who helped me and I asked for two cups of water.  She only gave me one cup, while I asked for two, one for me and one for my boyfriend.  She said that he would have to come up here and get his water himself.  WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS SERVICE?  I WAS THE ONE WHO PLACED THE ORDER.  I ordered two sandwiches.  Does it really matter who comes up for the water as long as I have the receipt with me ?  What if I had come in there by myself and I ordered two sandwiches and I am only allowed 1 cup of water?  Does that even make any sense.....?  I don't get why they are so stingy with their water.  Are they on a budget?  or is CSUF on a budget?...  Second time I come here, I ask for two packs of ranch for my large fries instead of one, and the worker said she had to charge me 10 cents for the second one.  She specifically said "The second one is ONLY 10 cents more."  I didn't like the fact that she added the "ONLY".  It's not that I don't have money to pay for it.  However, it just seemed like she was being judgmental, more like mocking me if I was unable to pay 10 cents for it.  And since when do they charge you for asking for extra ranch?  Seriously... this place is on a budget I swear...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very nice team and clean restaurant. Overall great deal and nice atmosphere. The salsa bar was well stocked. Five star customer service despite it being a fast food joint. Very cool!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">1. The girl taking my order tried to upsell me on different food items 3 times...after I kept telling her I just wanted a quesadilla
2. The iced coffee sucks
3. The cheese wasn't even MELTED in my quesadilla...I mean that's really all you have to do to make a quesadilla is MELT the damn cheese...Come onnnnn.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I Love Keith And Elsa!! They Are So Personable And Warm And Truly Hospitable And Fun, The Few Times I've Dined Here They've Helped Make My Experience So Happy And Memorable. The Rest Of The Staff Is Really Friendly And Kind And Nice To Each Other Too, Which Makes The Environment So Pleasing And Comfortable To Dine In<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you are going to work in the food industry you need to have a genuine smile on your face. If someone ask a question it is probably because they need to know so they can decide what to order. Should have just gone to Del Taco they are friendly. Carl's Jr. Needs to put their employee through customer service training. Seriously. The attitude totally kills the desire to go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I go to a lot of Carl's Jr., but none really deserve mentioning or type a review for, especially a five stars rating. I came ro this location three times at minimum, truly, it's always an exceptional experience. 

Maybe I got lucky, because I am super surprised how low their rating is.  They always have great consistent service. The place is pretty clean for the most part and the price is obviously great. Above all, everything you order is always hot, fresh and yummy! My ultimate favorite is of course their Shakes. They got some serious flavors and are made with real ice creams. Another yummy for my tummy. I personally think that the Management in this location is doing an outstanding job holding the ship.  Will definitely be back very soon.

Usually this is the time where the burgers are freshest since I'm a weirdo and don't like breakfast food at breakfast time. Horrible.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just went to buy my godson a chicken star meal and 3 taquitos for myself..  As soon as we got home the food was so cold, chicken stars felt like they were a leftovers from the night before, fries felt like they were cooked in the morning and the taquitos were cold inside.. Just wasted 10 dollars I ended up tossing the food unfortunately I do not have time to go back nor do I want to! Last time I'll be going to there...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Customer service was amazing. they were very nice and friendly.
Maybe i just came in a good day, i don't know. but i came with 2 of my friends, and we were just really surprised at how well they treated us. my friends and i all agreed, it was the best experience we had at a fast food restaurant. it was a couple of dudes working in the front.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">All good here. 

Fast service by pleasant people. The food was good so I am happy.

The Carl's Jr. In Orange on Main St. Should send the people they have working there over here to see how it is done.

The other nice thing is that it was clean and did not smell like sewage.

I only give 5 stars to places that blow me away. Theses guys did not blow me away but they are very good. Leaps and bounds better than the place in Orange.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you are in the drive-thru and they ask you to pull forward and park to wait for your food, you should refuse. You will sit there for 15 minutes until you have to go inside to get your food only to find out they forgot about you and to top it off, the mgr quickly apologizes and tries to hurry you out the door like you are inconveniencing them! Maybe this is the best customer service this particular location has to offer. Very disappointing<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Carl's Jr. Is the worst. All of the people here should be fired! EVERYONE. Last time I said next time I go here if I have to go back to get my order  fixed I won't be going back. Well it happened! So you have lost me at this location!! Employees are rude and put finger print imprints in food!!  My bun on my burger was literally smashed with a finger print. Gross. Also laugh in the back when we bring the food back.. That they messed up. They mess up on purpose so that you come back. Multiple occurrences. Have figured out the cycle of these employees at this location. All are awful. Store manager check your cameras!! I'm trying to help you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">drove through for quick dinner with my family. I almost had to make a list of all the things wrong with our order so I didn't forget any...
my root beer tastes like Perrier. its a bummer to be pay over $2 for a cup of soda and the syrup is so low its literally got no flavor
we ordered 3 different items that come with sauce. I asked for BBQ sauce for everything. the order guy even confirmed it at the end of the order - not a single packet of any sauce in the bag much less BBQ
I ordered and was charged for a beef, bean, and cheese burrito = $1.99. i received a 99c bean and cheese value menu burrito
my sons chicken nugget kids meal was tossed so sloppily into the bag that it was all floating around loose when he opened it - and he didn't get the number of nuggets I ordered
for THIS kind of service we're supposed to support the idea of $15 per hour for fast food employees? this was a service disaster<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place !! Always yummy, people are complaining on the wait or that it takes longer than OTHER fast food places but I think they also fail to realize a lot of their food is made to order and it's always fresh soooo shut up and eat your burger.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They started taking my order at 10:58 ish and mid order they just turned off their microphone and menu light outside and ignored us. After trying to figure out what just happened we pulled up the the drive thru window to finish the order. Was barred shut and all we got was a little "sorry" wave. It took me aback how awful someone's service could be when they just flip the sign off in the middle of taking my order and then expecting me to just leave.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Kevin was great, go Kevin! Great customer service which normally I just don't expect in fast food. Keep up the good work and try not to become too bitter from all the shitty customers I'm sure you encounter.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was super great! The lady at the window was so nice and not to mention that the burger is delicious. Better than in n out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review would probably be a three star cuz last time we got some really gross undercooked fried zucchini and onion rings but I made it five because of our awesome window server Eugenia! She redeemed this place. We always have a special (aka complicated) order since we're vegan. We ordered two western bacons without the patty or bacon or cheese (sounds crazy but we put our own veggie patties and vegan cheese on at home, we have a system). And then when my boyfriend asked for a famous star with no cheese she said they had a meatless burger that was only 99 cents so we didn't have to do that. And then at the window she let us know in the future that we can just build our own veggie burgs starting with the meatless burger; super helpful info for vegans who like the occasional fast food! Side note: the cherry coke tasted awful so we came back through the drive thru to replace it, she thought it was cause she accidentally gave us diet cherry coke. But the replacement tasted terrible too. We didn't want to go through a third time so we just cut our losses and headed home to make our delicious burgers but just a heads up y'all need to fix that cherry coke situation. Anywho thanks Eugenia for being so patient and helpful, we really appreciated it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been going to this Carls Jr now for over 20 years.  The last year or so it has not been the same.  My last two visits the food was horrible.  Seemed like it had been sitting around for quite some time, it was very cold and the buns seemed stale.  I called to try to speak with a manager tonight and not surprised but nobody is available.  So I told the girl on the phone about my complaint and she said that if I come and buy more food tonight it should be good.  I just cannot understand why a business would not at least say I am sorry for the bad experience and how can we make it up to you.  Poor customer service. No communication.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm generally a fan of Carls Jr. and find the staff here to be friendly and capable. My 1-star is for the food I had on my recent visit. From what I did get to eat, the good itself was bad tasting, however eat with caution! My son pulled a bobby pin out of his Big Carl burger. Not only was it disgusting, but it was potentially EXTREMELY dangerous - as it could have easily been swallowed and choked on. His discovery sickened the table and we ended up throwing all the food away. I tried several times to contact the restaurant via the corporate website, calling the restaurant, and tweeting. No response. I will not be returning to Carl's until I receive some communication from them. Depending on how they handle this, it will speak volumes about their customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their drive thru is terrible. I've only gone at night but every time I have their employee is rude. I've never had an issue with the food, just the service is crap.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">These guys suck.

I usually like ketchup, but recently some sh*t went down with ketchup and my ex that I just can't get into, so I did not want ketchup anywhere near my food.  So I pull up to the drive thru and order a Superstar with no ketchup.
Speaker:  Silence.....
Gandalf: hello?
Speaker: -Superstar with no cheese?
Gandalf: No. Superstar with no ketchup.
Speaker:  Long pause...Superstar doesn't come with ketchup.

That's bullshit, I know it does, but clearly she doesn't get it or she doesn't give a shit, so I just say okay and pull up to the window. A different lady hands me the bag and says, " The burger has a pink sauce, like a thousand island. But its not ketchup"

Bottom line, it had ketchup. Eff u biatches. Why's every woman trying to force ketchup on Gandalf? This is not the first time they've gotten my order wrong, but it will be the last.  They just don't give a shit and anyone should feel uncomfortable with the thought of such people handling ground beef and chicken.

But you say, Gandalf, what's the big deal about ketchup? I used to love ketchup. Trust me, you don't want to know what went down, but it was almost as bad as when Gandalf dropped the soap in the shower in prison. Besides, it's not about the ketchup, it's about the "I don't give a F" attitude the employees have.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not worth one star! Why dont they work on keeping the hamburger the same  the original 6 dollar burger was not the same size as the famous star but it is now!<p>

</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm no burger fan. I may have a burger 5 times a year and only unders some duress. But last night I ordered their Big Burger and wow, it hit the spot.  Okay, I also ordered two beef tacos from the green burrito side too.  Yes, yes, I was a little piggie ... but I didn't eat lunch and I was starving!! That my be why everything tasted darn yummy.  The guy who took our order was really nice and sweet.  So a big star just for him!  

The only thing I didn't like was their pico de gallo and salsa.  All you who read my reviews know I like flavor and there were none for both.  Add a little salt will ya?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My mother made a pretty terrific turkey burger when I was growing up. Naturally, you can understand why I gagged on the tasteless and rubbery disc -- adorned by a hard hunk of yellow lettuce and a slice of pale-pink tomato -- in the hand-held entree that Carl's describes as a turkey burger.

Did I mention that when I ordered one of these bad boys, I was the only customer in the drive-through line at 1:50 p.m., waited seven minutes for my order and STILL received I-don't-give-a-sh!t service from the awful girl at the window?

Carl Karcher would've been ashamed to have seen this spectacle at one of his stores.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This was my first time here and I went through the drive thru during my lunch break. I ordered a western bacon burger and it tasted great. The service was as could be expected. But as soon as I started eating my burger my stomach felt funny. I'm currently at work vomiting like crazy. I feel nauseous and sick. My expectations with food is that it won't make me so sick I have to leave work early and stay by a bucket all day. Will never eat here again. Be careful what you eat here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Drive thru is slow and 3 different people were taking my order!
 1st guy: hi welcome to Carl's blah blah blah 
So I start saying my order 
Girl: I'm sorry what was that
I repeat
Guy again: what was that agin?
Seriously guys are we playing games here??<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was ok.What really made me mad is that I went up to ask for a water cup and nobody gave me service I was standing there for about 5 minutes FOOD was OK service was TERRIBLE.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't go for breakfast, I went at 7:30am, I'm pretty sure the drive-thru waitress was half asleep when she took my order. I went with my dad since we had a coupon for BOGO Chorizo Egg and Cheese Burritos(Coupon # 9621 for biscuit,#9622 for burrito, but read-on before venturing.) The experience was a disaster. 

I ordered two of the burritos, and told her i had a coupon. I had to repeat the coupon number like 4 times before she got the number right... I ordered two drinks, same size, a diet coke and a dr pepper. Then she screws up writing it down on the drive-thru order screen thinking it was two biscuits instead of two burritos, coupon number was clearly for burritos, anyways she tells me to drive to the window before she can get the order correct on the screen let alone a total... She says some total when I pull up, I give her the money, get the change, she hands me the first drink and says "This is the Diet Coke." 
(On the lid, she had pushed in the  "OTHER" indicator - of the possible OTHER, COKE, DIET) 

Then she hands me what should have been a Dr. Pepper, with no indications marked on the lid. I ignore it, thinking she must have marked other instead of diet and asked for some salsa for the burritos. We take off.

 I take a sip of my drink and notice right away notice she switched the two by mistake, giving my father, who has diabetes and congestive heart failure a  high sugar, high caffeine, Dr. Pepper. My dad says his is fine and tastes like diet coke but I'm drinking a diet coke as I type this.. maybe she gave us two diet cokes... but all she had to do was punch in the diet marker for the right lid and there would have been no problem.

We get home and open the bag, she only gave me one packet of salsa for two burritos, she also didn't give me a receipt and i'm pretty sure she overcharged me by ignoring the coupon altogether. 

And the burrito...

The burrito consisted of 4-5 "Hash Rounds"(Round Hashbrowns aka tater-tots), less than an oz of some really processed pico de gallo (old or previously frozen for some time), literally a tablespoon of the so-called Chorizo (basically a brown, somewhat spicy, soy-based meat substitute.) The other 90-95% of the burrito was instant eggs and tortilla.  I was not impressed. I've finished the burrito and still have yet to find the cheese. Or a reason to come back for breakfast.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review is for drive-thru service only and is based on 4 visits at different times of the day and different days of the week.  My first visit was right after the remodel was done and I gave them some slack, thinking the drive-thru was brand new and things would improve with time.  But months later, the only way to describe the service AND the food is mediocre, bordering on horrible.

Each time I've ordered, I've waited way too long for someone to take my order, they've claimed to not have standard menu items, sighed at me when I asked questions, left food out of my order and have given me the wrong food.  And the wait times are ridiculous, even when I've been the only person in line.

Last Thursday was the worst visit yet.  There were 2 cars ahead of us in the drive-thru, they ordered, pulled up and when we got to the speaker...silence.  Both cars ahead of us got their food and pulled away and no one had even said hello to us.  We waited for a good 5 minutes and the only reason we stayed was because we had a hungry 3 year old in the car.  We finally had to ask if anyone was there and she acted totally startled, like she had dozed off or something.  We finally ordered, got our food and when we started unpacking the bags, everything was just tossed in, including french fry containers that were put in upside down.  It seriously looked like my 3 year old granddaughter had packed it herself.  The food itself was sloppy looking, my tomato was the stem end and my lettuce was a huge chunk of yellow core.  My husband's jalapeno patty melt was a mess and both orders of fries were stale tasting.

Bottom line, you get the definite impression that the employees don't give a shit.  If anything, the service has gotten progressively worse since the re-opening and I think I'll take the time to drive to the Rose Drive location the next time we get a Carl's craving.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">terrible service. I walked in and was behind one person. he finished ordering then the cashier left to do I don't know what. understandable but she didn't say sh+t to me. then more people came in. still no word. a good 5 Minutes of waiting then I finally get to order. went to pay and they want you to pay $1 for card fee. are you kidding me. they're going to profit from us using a card? I know no bank is going to charge them 1$. I'm not cheap but 1$ is outrageous. so I looked in my wallet for cash. total was 5.71 and I had 5$. gave it to her and said I'll be right back with the 71 cents. she looked at me like she couldn't put in the order unless fully paid. I told her I will be right back. she says wait. are you going to give me exactly 71 cents? who gives a f+-& if its exact or not. you can't do math to figure out my change or what ? never coming back. 4$ for a steak burrito that had nothing but mooshy beans.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The staff is hit or miss here, but usually fine. Nothing extraordinary just your basic fast food joint. The restaurant always appears to be clean although i've never dined in. The salsas at the salsa area look like they've been sitting there for a while, can't say how fresh they taste as I'm hesitant because of their appearance.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">On 9-21-2013 @ 4:15 p.m.  Pulled into the "drive through" .  There was 1 car ahead of me waiting at the speaker to place his order.  After he waited at least 3 minutes for your "drive through order taker" to take his order the customer honked his horn hoping to wake-up the person from their siesta.  Still no answer; they must be texting and can't be busy with customers.  Disgusted with the poor service he continued on his way through & out of the drive through lane.  I did the same.  I'm sure Carl's Jr. has lost much more business due to this employee.  This employee should be fired and perhaps the entire crew also that was on duty at that time of day.   

Carl Karcher ran a class business, unlike the people in charge today.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My order is wrong every time I've been here. The staff really struggle with basic English.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am giving this Carl's jr a 5 star just based off their customer service and new general manager. Last night I went in the drive thru and got my food but part of my order was missing. Obviously this is not fun to deal with so I called them and they said they would be happy to give me a free meal for my troubles. I ended up not going last night but called today and they were quick to help me out and give me a free meal for messing up my order the night before. The new general managers name was Norma (I think) and she was professional and very kind in making sure I was comfortable and taken care of. This Carl's jr is also very clean and nice on the inside and the food is always pretty good. Because of the new management and customer service I will be coming back for a while.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ultra bad service. The fountain drink just tastes like water. The woman who took our order was working on Sunday afternoon. She did it wrong and we asked her that we didn't want these things. She gave us stare and attitude like it was our fault, then she told the manager like can you do it plz, I dont want these people to yell at me.

Fuck.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My daughter and I ate here today and we both got very nauseous about 10 minutes afterward. Both of us had a famous star with cheese and french fries. By the time we got home we both vomited. It's five hours later and we are both still sick and vomiting and it has moved through my "system" now. I am weak, nauseous, have a head ache and trying to go to sleep. I will never eat at a Carl's Jr. again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have never received the kind of service I got here at any other fast food joint I have ever been to. Every few minutes, someone would ask me if everything was ok and if I needed anything. I had an extra hamburger that I was going to take with me. A service lady saw me getting ready to leave, and asked if I wanted to take it to go. She promptly took the burger from me and returned it in a bag with napkins.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Too slow! Every time I eat here, I have to wait 10-15 minutes for my food. That is way too long for a fast food place! By comparison, I get my food from Taco Bell down the street before I have time to fill up my drink.<p>
