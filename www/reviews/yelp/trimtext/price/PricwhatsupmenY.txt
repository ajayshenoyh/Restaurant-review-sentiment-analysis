I prefer this place over Kopan Ramen because the prices are better and you don't have to order every ingredient separately. 
 At least the price and service was good. 
 great prices. 
 Great portions and good price. 
I'm surprised that a place that prices about $8 a bowl is this good. 
For the portion size I thought it was a little overpriced.
