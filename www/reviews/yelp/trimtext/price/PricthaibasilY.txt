 For the price. 
Prices are okay. 
I feel like this was overpriced for mediocre and bland dishes. 
But the food is really overpriced considering how little the portion is. 
 all of the items were a small portion for the price. 
 there was a mismatch between portion size and price. 
  Look for a restaurant with a better balance of authentic flavors and lower prices or more generous portions
  The price are also super decent. 
Price: 5. 
Prices have gone up about $1. 
 Which isnt that bad considering they dont often raise their prices. 
 veggie pad thai costs like $9. 
 My total lunch price was $11. 
 My only recommendation would be anyone desiring a bigger food serving when ordering lunch buy from the dinner menu at that serving size and price. 
-Decent food and decent prices
 The prices are reasonable for what your paying. 
 fair prices. 
Overall its a decent meal at a decent price with a decent  menu. 
Best of all the prices are very good . 
 the prices are outrageous for Thai food ($9 for most meals plus $2 for a small cup of rice?. 
 reasonably priced options so maybe I will go back and give a follow-up review
 The price was great too. 
 it costs like $9 for a lunch combo that comes with rice. 
 I suggest dining here - Good prices - great food. 
 Prices are ok.

 and not super expensive. 
 the prices are a bit high and the portions smaller than i'm used to. 
 at this price. 
 the price was good. 
For the prices.

 the perfect seasoning and a decently priced portion. 
Lunch specials have very good prices and satisfying portions.
