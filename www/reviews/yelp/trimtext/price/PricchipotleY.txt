I rather eat across the street where it will fill me up for a cheaper price along with great taste. 
 I know it seems expensive . 
?   Guacamole is the only thing that costs a little extra. 
Even though the prices just went up for a few of the times on the menu. 
 I think the price for a burrito here is totally worth it. 
this is always a good choice to come and grab some lunch for an inexpensive price. 
 since the guy putting on the topping didn't hear i got a double steak bowl for the price of a regular bowl. 
 my real gripe are the prices they charge for their food. 
Take guac for example - That shit is expensive to get it added on to your dish. 
Now I have noticed that they have smaller portions for the same price so that was upsetting 
My only thing I have to nitpick about is the price. 
 It can get pricey. 
The prices aren't bad at all either. 
 Prices went up recently. 
 the gaucomole is overpriced. 
The prices for the burritos and other stuff I think are pretty fair. 
 too expensive. 
Avoid this particular location at all costs. 
Price for a burrito bowl is around $6. 
 its pretty expensive. 
The gauc is overpriced.
