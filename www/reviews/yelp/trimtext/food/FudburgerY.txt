 Who wants old hard cold food???
The customer service is terrible with an employee and her boyfriend spreading mulch and then going to the counter to take your order and to handle your food. 
 food and orders and even just people being who they are. 
not only for the food . 
 I asked if they could fill up my drink behind the counter and they said that one was out of order too. 
 Horrible food quality compared to other Burger Kings. 
 it took me FOREVER to get my drinks. 
To make matters even worse the smoothies tasted terrible. 
the bun on my burger tasted old and hard 
 the manager was working and he had my food ready and i came to pick it up and checked my order for accuracy.
