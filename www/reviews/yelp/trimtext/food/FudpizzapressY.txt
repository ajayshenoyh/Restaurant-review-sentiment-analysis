 Then guy has us pay and asks if we want drinks. 
 So I got my girlfriend and I two regular drinks. 
 So we're like ok maybe we get our drinks when we get our pizza. 
 We had to ask another guy for the drinks because the other guy was talking to the girl working. 
  They gave us a free drink for a Yelp check-in and would stop by our table to check up on us. 
  If you enjoy drinking beer while eating pizza. 
 There's a subtle taste of garlic. 
 beverages (includes fountain drinks. 
 Check in on Yelp to redeem a free soft drink. 
 let's break down the food. 
  Don't forget to check in on yelp to receive a free fountain drink with your pizza as well. 
 I enjoyed the food. 
 Especially because my mom spilled her drink all over the floor. 
  The pepperoni tastes better here. 
  They should have someone who handle the money and not handle the food as well. 
 the food itself just wasn't doing it for me. 
 tasted more creamy than I was expecting for a pasta salad. 
All that being said about the food and beer. 
# The lines are long during lunch time because they're really new. 
 the most beer-friendly and stereotypical food item. 
# The pizza here makes for a decent lunch. 
 Each personal pizza is a good size that's plenty for lunch. 
 A wider variety of options (both food and drank) make it a little more desirable than its bajillion competitors. 
The food is still great. 
Food was pretty bomb though. 
 They even reminded me of the free drink I could get when I checked in on Yelp. 
What makes this place so good is that it is so fresh and you can taste the quality. 
 the food is great. 
CRUST - Winner: Pizza Press - Something about it just makes the pizza's taste profile better. 
CHEESE - Winner: Pieology - I think the cheese at Pieology tastes better. 
VEGGIES: Pieology's veggies seem to taste more fresh (may be because of the way they're baked). 
 you will get a lot of food. 
OVERALL TASTE: Pizza Press. 
 and I don't feel like I'm in a food coma afterwards. 
 I'm not a drinker. 
 so go drink on your own and find out. 
 I was very satisfied with the food with great customer service as well. 
 I can't finish a ton of food. 
 The taste was very good. 
But how this place beats out Pieology and Blaze is is the cheese is put on better and tastes better. 
 the pizza is too dry for my taste. 
 it still tastes good. 
 Amazing how great it tasted. 
Now to the actual food. 
 couldn't really taste anything else on it and the dipping sauce was ehh. 
 the taste of this pizza was much better. 
 with not super different food. 
 the guy preparing my food was only wearing gloves half the time. 
 I work with food for my job and I know how big of a no-no it is to not be wearing protective gloves when dealing with customers food. 
Overall the taste of the pizza wasn't terrible. 
 4 out of 4 music graduate students approve of the food and the beer. 
 I didn't mention a thing since I'm not one to waste food. 
The food is structured the same way as Pieology or Blaze. 
The food: nicely baked. 
god it was like drinking oil with a hint of dry dough. 
 I was amazed at how fresh the pizza still tasted. 
 the pizza from the Pizza Press tasted like it was still fresh out of the oven. 
 quality ingredients in their food which definitely stands out against places like Blaze Pizza and Pizza Studio. 
 They gave me a 15% discount for being a CSUF  student so dinner ended up being cheaper than Pieology. 
Now the food. 
 I can not taste the sauce like at all. 
 all i tasted was the cheese. 
fast customer service and the quality food. 
 The spice level was non existent and just tastes like a lot of salt.
