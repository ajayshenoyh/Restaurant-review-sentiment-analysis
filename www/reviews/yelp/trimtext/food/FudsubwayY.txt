 and I seriously hope that this owner learns to take food safety more seriously. 
 has a great fountain drink dispenser. 
I'm still not a fan of the 101 flavor soda machine (every time I use it my soda always seems to have a lingering taste of whatever the person before me had). 
 I'm usually friendly and polite to whoever's making my sandwich (they do have control of my food. 
 and almost like fast food. 
 and pick from about a bajillion drinks. 
 and crazy Coke drinks. 
) I got honey mustard sauce (my usual) on one of my sandwiches and it tasted extremely sour. 
  I come back to the cashier and tell her I think the honey mustard is expired and that it tastes very sour. 
  She says "that's how honey mustard is supposed to taste" with a look on her face like I'm an idiot. 
2 the sandwich I'm really regretting not doing so cause it tastes like shit with the salt.
