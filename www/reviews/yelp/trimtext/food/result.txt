 Who wants old hard cold food???
The customer service is terrible with an employee and her boyfriend spreading mulch and then going to the counter to take your order and to handle your food. 
 food and orders and even just people being who they are. 
not only for the food . 
 I asked if they could fill up my drink behind the counter and they said that one was out of order too. 
 Horrible food quality compared to other Burger Kings. 
 it took me FOREVER to get my drinks. 
To make matters even worse the smoothies tasted terrible. 
the bun on my burger tasted old and hard 
 the manager was working and he had my food ready and i came to pick it up and checked my order for accuracy. 
fofofo-dollar-fast-food-plus-tax
 my go to spot for food on campus. 
 It usually comes down to the food sitting under the heat lamp a bit longer. 
 or food being not piping hot. 
As long as Carl's Jr's as a whole continues to run their 4 dollar deal and I have classes on campus and don't have food on me. 
 this is where I'll go for my fast food fix. 
 I might even come here if I packed food. 
 fast food is that good to me. 
 Sub par food 
 the food tastes terrible. 
s taste 10 times better. 
Cons: Food is very poor quality than other Carl's Jr. 
 3 out of 5 times most of the burgers are reheated and taste horrible. 
 Overall quality in other fast food restaurants and in other Carl's Jr. 
 It has to be in its preparation because I do not think a major food franchise like Carl's Jr would serve an inferior product. 
 read these complaints and then reassess how their food and beverages are prepared. 
 It is very unfortunate you cannot enjoy some decent coffee to go along with a breakfast burrito or a sausage & egg muffin. 
 I've generally had good food. 
 fries taste slightly sour versus fries at any other Carl's Jr. 
Food sits for hours under heat lamps. 
Food tastes so bad my dog won't even eat it. 
Food is overpriced. 
As I walked away with my food. 
They also practice timed refills based on what size drink you ordered. 
**UPDATE: They now only allow refills on large size drinks. 
 it was the best experience we had at a fast food restaurant. 
 The food was good so I am happy. 
my root beer tastes like Perrier. 
for THIS kind of service we're supposed to support the idea of $15 per hour for fast food employees? this was a service disaster
 so I did not want ketchup anywhere near my food. 
 I ordered two drinks. 
 she hands me the first drink and says "This is the Diet Coke. 
 I take a sip of my drink and notice right away notice she switched the two by mistake. 
 My dad says his is fine and tastes like diet coke . 
 I'm drinking a diet coke as I type this. 
 Or a reason to come back for breakfast. 
 left food out of my order and have given me the wrong food. 
  Both cars ahead of us got their food and pulled away and no one had even said hello to us. 
 got our food and when we started unpacking the bags. 
  The food itself was sloppy looking. 
 I come in and order my food and I can't help . 
 I was so much more happier when I sat down to eat my food. 
I'm giving it 4 stars because overall I've had good experiences and the taste of Chipotle is amazing. 
The only thing that still taste good is the chips. 
Food is still good. 
felt like the little souffl√© cups that you put ketchup in at most fastfood places. 
[FOOD]
 The food is always fresh tasting and piping hot. 
 It's still a lot of food overall. 
 you'd think I asked for extra food for free. 
 The food needs flavor. 
 Tasted like. 
 The food is too good to avoid haha. 
 Don't go here if you want 'fast' food. 
I rather eat across the street where it will fill me up for a cheaper price along with great taste. 
 This food is DELICIOUS. 
 there are actually quite a few different items you can order as you build your own meal to suit your own tastes. 
 and it's all up to you and your individual tastes. 
 and absent hormones or antibiotics so you can feel as confident about the health benefits as you do about the taste. 
 The chicken is the best tasting chicken you can get for a fast food chain. 
So there goes my food down the food line while i stay behind the patrons in front. 
 But what can you expect? The food court at CSUF is absolutely terrible and this is one of the few places around that serves quality food. 
 The tortillas are the freshest that I have ever tasted. 
 as for me Chipotles quality of food is garbage and the customer service was terrible. 
 this place has flies flying around everywhere getting near the food and by far got the least amount of food here out of all the chipotles ive been to. 
If you're doing catering lemme recommend this: cover your food until you serve. 
 I understand if there are corporate standards that only permit workers to give you a certain amount of food. 
 what grossed me out was she was cleaning around the trash and stuck her hand in there to push it down then ran back to the register and was handling the food and closing tops to containers. 
 and lettuce for a grand total of 485 calories and 11 grams of fat which isn't bad considering the huge portion and the fact it's fast food. 
  All the ingredients tasted really fresh and went well together. 
I go here when I want a Mexican food kick . 
 don't want to risk food poisoning by going "authentic". 
*Food Quality:
 they obviously don't care about the food they're serving. 
 I am willing to drive the extra miles for the classic Chipotle service & food quality. 
this is always a good choice to come and grab some lunch for an inexpensive price. 
The food was good at least. 
 and tasty as hell food. 
Just because it is fast food doesn't mean the service has to be so terrible. 
They need to really maintain quality control of their food. 
The food here is OK here . 
 my real gripe are the prices they charge for their food. 
 I can't remember the last time I paid $10 for to go food and the quality being mediocre. 
 I want to be able to bite into beef that's lean and doesn't take me 30 chews to get the food down. 
 I checked out their food calorie content. 
 Makes me wonder why I exercise and still continue to make poor food choices. 
 I didn't come here for a dinner and a show. 
 next time I'll skip the lunch and go next door to shop at Total Wine & More. 
It's a lot of food for your money. 
I don't come  often only cuz I can think of other places to spend less than $6 on Mex-style food. 
The only issue with this location is the amount of people who come here during the lunch rush. 
The food is as good as you can expect chipotle to be - . 
Love the food here. 
Love the food. 
It was in the middle of the lunch rush and they ran out of chicken for maybe 5 min. 
Great customer service & delicious food here. 
 they did give us 2 free drinks. 
 I went there with my boyfriend for Sunday night dinner and we both got the burrito bowls. 
 she adds the pico de gallo and cheese and literally throws my food towards the cashier. 
 always give me crap for eating at Chipotle because it's not "authentic" Mexican food. 
 do I look Mexican to you? Do you actually think I would know the difference between "authentic" and non-authentic Mexican food? Come on. 
 if the food taste good. 
 I would have given this place a 4 stars for their food. 
 The hell you think this is pre-school sit down and eat your food don't hulahoop in front of me ya loser. 
*Tastes the same as any other Chipotle. 
 But the food makes up for it. 
Pros: quick lunch & close to school
 we went for dinner and. 
 the food was fresh and the portion was so generous. 
 Just wanted to get a late dinner from being at school all day. 
 double-check your food for bugs. 
AND if you have the time and chance to (if you find a critter in your food) go complain. 
 I love places like this because you literally make your food how you want it done. 
 And if it doesn't taste good. 
 I thought the "typical lunch hour" was over so there wouldn't be that much of a wait. 
I rather wait to eat lunch when I get home or just eat somewhere else in general. 
and this location prob has the most seats in the complex -- the parking lot gets full during the week at lunch so carpool. 
My food of choice is the burrito. 
 I do not experience the food coma (insulin spike). 
 and they give a little more food :)
  They have high-quality food that always tastes delicious. 
  They follow the statement "Food With Integrity" which is always a big plus. 
tastes so good with the guacamole :)
Around lunch time. 
 They always serve good portions of the food. 
The only bad thing is that if you go during lunch time. 
No - It's not authentic Mexican food. 
 Honestly it's a huge fast food chain how authentic do you want it. 
 So basically because Chipotle wants to be stingy with a few cents worth of food. 
 its often not long before you are done paying for your food and finding a seat. 
The quality of the food is excellent. 
 I still get it because it tastes so good. 
 didn't you give up fast food for Lent?"
  "Let's define fast food. 
Service is quick here and sometimes it does feel like a fast food joint. 
 the ingredients are fresher and taste a bit better. 
 you can place your order online and cut the long lunch line. 
  ~$6 for lunch. 
 and far be it from me to tell anyone how to order their food. 
  I've never had a Chipotle refuse to prepare my food like that. 
  It's been so BAD that they have compensated by giving my entire office free lunch and there were still items wrong even on the compensation order. 
The only time I will come here now is when I am desperate and forget my lunch on the counter at home. 
This location gets CRAZY crowded during lunch so come early (before 11:30) or expect a long wait (and no available seats). 
The staff is pretty friendly and I was always satisfied with the food. 
 there is always a line and don't even think about going there during lunch time if you do not have 20 extra minutes to wait in line. 
 and if you have a student id freee drink. 
cheap fast yummy food :)
 the food is good. 
During lunch hours. 
 I only ate half and am saving the other half for dinner. 
The service is usually pretty quick though sometimes I think they focus more on getting food done quickly than being friendly and not seeming rushed. 
 there's times where your burrito will get well ahead of you while in line and you have to shout what you'd like on it across a number of people because the cash register can't keep up with the people making the food. 
 The tables are rarely cleaned off by the workers and pieces of food frequently cover the floor. 
 Too much food. 
The food was amazing. 
 the food was still really good. 
FAST FOOD? I THINK NOT. 
I have not even tasted the food yet. 
I love Indian food and we've eaten at like a dozen mom and pop places around OC. 
 And this place had delicious food. 
 The food looks soooo good. 
 the taste doesn't match the face. 
 because a lot of people like the food here. 
 Don't drink a lot since their is no public bathroom. 
 Tikka Masala tasted like something was missing. 
 The food is piping hot and the aromatics of the spices are sublime. 
 Good food and a great price is a universal phenomenon all people can understand. 
I love Indian food because it's so flavorful with all the spices and Curry Hut offers some of the best curry around. 
 you'll probably want to taste a bit of everything anyway. 
 my favorite reason to enjoy Indian food--comes paired with your meal. 
  And if the food alone doesn't bring you back--I mean. 
I do have to admit that the food can be a bit inconsistent on different days. 
  It is kinda of a fast food type of Indian restaurant. 
This place is always packed at lunch. 
 The food is always piping hot and tasty. 
  I saw the signage for fastish Indian food. 
  I had food in my fridge at home . 
 They actually let you taste test before you order a full serving. 
 Which is cool for people who don't eat this kind of lovely food . 
 The food is SUPER FRESH. 
I guess this is considered Indian fast food. 
 my church has become a regular at this place and we'll definitely come back for our Sunday lunches . 
 and we were craving Indian food. 
 It literally looks like a fast food joint. 
 and inside looks like a fast food joint. 
 to the taste. 
 The first thing I noticed was the deep rich spices and the creamy taste of tikka masala. 
 your stomach would slowly get fuller and your eyelids get heavier = food coma. 
 Indian food would always be followed by an Indian nap. 
 Americanized Indian food is the best way to describe the curry here. 
 it was so runny and lacked that richness that I associate with Indian food. 
 It tasted watered down basically. 
 It tasted fine . 
 their prices are very reasonable and you will walk out with a decent amount of food. 
 I would personally just pay a little more and have better tasting food. 
 so it's a pretty good introduction for anyone who hasn't tried much Indian food yet. 
I think this place is excellent in value and great in terms of taste. 
 I know where to go for Indian food in Fullerton. 
Food: 4. 
 They don't fish them out and it tastes totally gross to bite into one of those seeds. 
 Wide variety of drinks and they also have 2 TV screens usually playing Indian soaps on both ends of the little store. 
 the food. 
 at fist glance the food doesn't look really appetizing. 
 so don't be surprised if you have to wait a little for parking or getting your food. 
The food is amazing and on top of that. 
 At the very first taste I was HEAD OVER HEELS. 
 a bit spicy for my taste for a mid day meal. 
 I was there on a Sat lunch. 
  That is my only taste complaint. 
Food is excellent. 
 it doesn't affect my opinion of the food. 
 you can watch Bollywood videos while your food is being prepared. 
Good food. 
Good food. 
Lunches on Sunday are usually spent at Mickey-D's
"Daddy's choice for lunch. 
For value and Indian food fun
For value and Indian food fun
If you're in the mood for some quick yet delicious Indian food check out Curry Hut. 
 tastes pretty not special. 
I know it claims to be fast food. 
 Foods off the hook. 
 Really great food. 
 We were offered samples of the food too. 
We were a little worried when we arrived because we thought it was a fast food place . 
 the person behind the counter gave us samples and all the food was delicious. 
DELICIOUS FOOD+AFFORDABLE PRICE= PARADISE. 
 there is a small buffet of hot food trays with helpful labels on the sneeze guard directly in front of you and nice aromas from the kitchen. 
 more for me to drink later. 
  I'm not an expert on Indian food . 
 I would recommend this place for a fast Indian food craving. 
Now to the food. 
  This place is where people go so they can claim they are a fan of Indian food even though most dishes barely qualifies as such. 
Most of the dishes did not taste like the dish it was suppose to be. 
 The food is fresh. 
 really who cares? If you're a foodie you'll get over it. 
I do recommend you NOT get a fountain drink and purchase a canned soda instead. 
 The workers are very kind and they seem happy to be serving you their food. 
 This is Panda-style Indian food. 
Is Curry Hut's food as good as my other favorite place? Not quite. 
 I did not taste much . 
 Goes hand in hand with the flavor profile in their food. 
1) A little too far from our house to drive here during Fullerton rush hour to get dinner to go. 
Comfort food. 
 Not here - I was out of food before I finished my bread. 
Taste wise my husband and mother in law did not like the chicken samosa at all. 
 Haven't tried the actual food. 
 We will stick to Indian food in Artesia
Authentic Indian food in quick. 
I would get the food to go. 
I was super hesitant trying a fast food Indian place as the few "Indian" type foods that I've tried in the north OC area have been subpar. 
 I was surprisingly amazed at how delicious and flavorful my lunch was. 
 I'm not an Indian food expert. 
 I didn't feel I was eating "fast food". 
 I will be back for sure and recommend for anyone who has the Indian food cravings. 
Will still return because of the quality of the food. 
The food quality and the service is great. 
 But the food taste is too comforting. 
 I prefer Indian food to be more authentic. 
 a lot more usage of spice (higher food cost. 
5 star place and people rave about how authentic the food tasted. 
So my reason to give this place a 3-star is that comparing to my experience having tried great Indian and Nepali food in the past. 
 But what I'm looking for the most in restaurants are "good food". 
 I always have this sensitive stomach which I rely on to determine of the food cleanliness when I dine out. 
Food taste: 2 Stars
 I really like the food. 
 I really craved Indian food so I drove all the way up here from Garden Grove. 
 and I don't feel like going out for food tomorrow. 
 I've had a lot of Indian food before and this is as good as you can get for the price. 
You should definitely try this place out if you both want Indian food and don't want to break the bank. 
 you get a STRONG DELICIOUS WIFF of the food. 
  I've been craving indian food for a while so i was really happy. 
  Check this place out if you like Indian Food and don't mind the strong smell. 
But the food is good. 
Good food. 
I am a HUGE fan of Indian food. 
 I have to say that it is definitely my favorite food. 
 the tikka masala had far too much yogurt or heavy cream (whichever was used) for my taste. 
 The dairy taste overpowered the spices that make Indian food so great. 
 The vegetable pakoras tasted stale and old. 
 BBQ - They raised the lunch prices from $9. 
 I got the Pa Nang Curry and wasn't impressed with the taste. 
Guppy's - Popcorn chicken meal lunch special for $7. 
 That's like a dinner price. 
85C - I'm NOT going to spend $10 worth of pastries for lunch. 
Fast food Indian? Think of yourself going to Panda Express and getting rice and 2 or 3 entrees. 
 The bang out for the buck instead of paying $12-$15 a dish to dine in at dinner. 
Vegetable korma - Creamy taste of the chicken tikka masala. 
 Indian food is like grabbing Mexican food at King Taco. 
 If you love Indian food or feeling a little bit adventurous like The Goonies. 
 and the food is delivered really quickly. 
Minus one star because it can be inconsistent at times with taste or undercooked meat. 
 good place if you're looking for tasty indian food. 
The place is small - a little amount of seating with TV for Indian music video (so hilirious - Indian people have a queer taste in dance and music video). 
I eat the foods and judge the place by myself. 
The foods were tasty unexpectedly. 
99 had a plenty of food for me. 
The food is set up like Panda express or any takeout food place you know. 
 I know that I can't eat indian food without it. 
Would I call it the best indian food place? Probably not. 
 We soon realized that we had ordered WAY too much food. 
 mango lassi drinks (and other lassi drinks). 
 I like having this hole-in-the-wall take out option for a quick lunch or dinner. 
 and get their mango lassi drinks. 
 it's just way too much food. 
 Chicken tikka masala was great and i believe they grilled the chicken first before the it swims in tikka masala sauce because there is a smoky taste with the chicken. 
The food was so rich in taste. 
Looks like a fast food restaurant and its also called fast food . 
 the food is beyond that. 
Food was awesome . 
 The food was hot and tasty and the naan bread came almost as soon as we sat down. 
dirty and the trash cans and tables are both covered in food and whatnot. 
 But that in no way detracts from the great food. 
I'm no expert on Indian food. 
 this place is great to get a quick fix of Indian food. 
I really enjoyed the food . 
The food is simply delicious. 
Come here if you like great Indian food at a fair price. 
 The service was great and the food was delicious
 I added a drink with my two item combo and it came out to around $10-$11. 
 The portions of food was huge. 
 I was full about halfway through my meal and I realized that the 2 item combo with naan was more than enough food for myself. 
Authentic indian food with fresh naan makes this a quality place. 
I was really craving Indian food. 
 I really disliked the presentation of food and knowing that the plastic cutlery and container were going in the trash (because I was dining in). 
 the food wasn't the same. 
 the Arnold that loves Indian food had some this past Sunday. 
 fat boy third person Arnold wanted Indian food again today. 
  I drive up to a loud orange & green designed Indian fast food restaurant. 
  Same great food. 
  I suggest y'all get your Indian food on. 
 the closest Indian food is probably Cerritos. 
 if you're DTF (Down To Foodie). 
 I still say nothing beats Little India Grill's food in Artesia. 
 watery chicken curry? It was so bland and tasted like spicy water that we had to throw it away :( what a waste. 
As it is a fast food joint. 
 But if you're looking for good food quick with great service. 
 With the food being so dense. 
 I ordered the 2 item combo deal of Goat Curry and Chicken Curry with Garlic Naan and a drink of Mango Lassi. 
Food was delicious. 
 consider you can get all you can eat indian lunch buffet around $10. 
  You would be better off going a few miles south to Punjabi (?) for better tasting food
 I have never tasted such sweet curry in my life. 
 I have tasted better. 
 the wild orange and green colors of the restaurant might give the appearance that the food can't be taken seriously. 
  This food is great and I consider the owner a friend. 
you won't be disappointed if you like Indian food. 
 restaurants can put too much seasoning and then all the potato tastes like is that one flavor. 
I love me some good Desi food - and this just doesn't cut it. 
 I absolutely LOVE the idea of Indian fast food - . 
 you do not taste the garam masala spices AT all. 
 I would much rather drive an extra 10 minutes and call in my order at a real Indian restaurant that can offer me better service and food for about $5 more bucks. 
One could go along and only comment on the food. 
Food was fine. 
 I was unsure on how it would taste . 
 All this was around $10 which is affordable or a big lunch that will last ya to dinner. 
 As a south indian i like spicy food. 
 otherwise you should absolutely come try the food. 
  The garlic naan was ok and the yogurt drink was nice also. 
Overall the food is good. 
 especially if you factor that it is fast food. 
The food was really good I'm not HUGE on Curry . 
 we ordered both the hot and cold dessert which I honestly wouldn't recommend BUT the food was definitely good. 
Parking can be difficult during the lunch rush. 
There's something about the meats that tastes so flavorful. 
 Everyone is so nice and food is always served on time and they never made any mistakes whenever we visit. 
 The food will speak for itself once you try it. 
 The rice sheets tasted slightly old and stiff. 
I came here today for lunch with my brother and have probably received the best service ive ever had at any Korean BBQ and ive been eating KBB for almost 10 years. 
On to the food. 
99 per person to experience the highest quality food they could provide. 
 Most of our items were beef and seafood. 
 Thanks to the Back Room which is a bar located behind the restaurant as that made our time go by after having a couple of drinks before our buzzer went off. 
99 on weekends and dinner. 
 fish cakes. 
Food: We went with the premium menu for $31. 
Drinks:  Since it was Monday night football. 
 The food is delicious and you won't be disappointed. 
Foodie tip: enjoy your meat even more by asking for the salt & sesame oil and dip all your meat in it. 
My recommendation for this place is to try them during lunch. 
  They don't have as many choices on the lunch menu. 
Our group of 10 had two grills to work with so that made cooking much more efficient and also allowed us to order more food at once. 
 tasted delicious. 
You like to have drinks while you're having amazing steaks?. 
  Other than that the food and service is 5 stars. 
 So I'm gonna start off by saying all their meat is very good and is above average quality and taste. 
 I guess they are hoping that as you're getting more full you don't notice that the quality of the food is going down and you might even blame your own judgement since you are full. 
 and she said that they always have a wait time during dinner everyday. 
 The only time you can come without waiting is weekdays at lunch time according to her. 
 I come during dinner time. 
The quality of the food is superb. 
 they are super stingy and are anal about food loss. 
  No other BBQ joints serves Filet as a part of their AYCE menu and it just tastes incredibly delicious. 
  they have a wide variety of side dishes that taste Aiites. 
 this is an AYCE and we just paid $32 per person for dinner. 
Coming in for a weekend dinner? Expect at least an hour+ wait. 
 Not sure if it's because it's lunch time. 
 I did not taste quality that was better than other places . 
 fish cakes. 
Whats asian food without rice??? We are sooooo needy . 
 I would definitely suggest coming for lunch to save a few bucks. 
its a lot of food choose from. 
food coma was creeping up. 
They didn't seem to have a charge for not eating all your food . 
Food:
) - knew when we wanted to order more food. 
 and have a few drinks as you wait. 
 the dinner price applies (+$20). 
What I love about Korean style food is the spread. 
 I knew I was at the right place when the majority of the table was covered in food and you can't fit all of it in a picture haha. 
drinks. 
 kept everything clean and asked if we wanted more food. 
yelps-top-100-places-to-eat-in-the-us-for-2016-fast-track-to-a-food-coma
I love the food there. 
 They have tons of different kind of meats and other food items like cold noodles. 
AYCE Dinner is $24 for the lowest one. 
The food here is your typical ayce Korean Barbeque . 
 refill drinks. 
Bulgogi: The best item from their AYCE lunch menu was the bulgogi. 
 stir fried fish cakes. 
Food was excellent - probably the widest array and most generous portions of banchan I've ever seen at KBBQ. 
99 for "PAYCE" (premium all you can eat lunch menu) was super reasonable - we started off the brisket (of course). 
 offering great food and not skimping. 
The food was ridiculously awesome. 
  they brought out a complimentary lunch tray with rice. 
 drink. 
 I can't wait to go back for lunch again. 
 i was there for lunch and was 1st customer so no wait. 
the food. 
- Great variety of meats and seafood items
  Mist everyone did not feel good and had to pack the food and left. 
  If you're a seafood person. 
It's $16 for lunch and they have a wide selection of quality meats. 
Food 3. 
 and food get burnt easily. 
 for the same price I get better food somewhere else. 
 tastes similar to Gen's Hawaiian steak. 
 its not the best kbbq I've tasted so far . 
 BBQ in Fullerton is one of the best spots and only spots I go to for the best quality food and excellent service. 
 Their menu options are extensive no matter which package you go to and during lunch or dinner. 
 Their food is consistently good quality from the side dishes to the meat selections. 
 their meat tasted bland compared to the meat here. 
 then it just tasted like the dry brisket. 
 Tastes like pure cream and sugar. 
Food quality - excellent 
 matches the food quality 
$23 dinner is a more than reasonable price for the variety and quality of meat you get. 
 honestly those samples were a round of drinks itself. 
The food was fresh and full of flavor. 
 If you come for lunch. 
99 and dinner is $23. 
 I'm going to say that lunch is wayyy more worth it value. 
 Dinner menu. 
 you get to spin it if you order $15 worth of drinks. 
 If you are coming during normal lunch or dinner hours. 
 I've learned my lesson and just show up at 11am for lunch to get my KBBQ fix here. 
food:
LUNCH ayce (11am-4pm M-F): $14. 
DINNER ayce (every other time ^. 
 dinner. 
 don't be dumb like us and show up thinking you're paying lunch price on weekends): $22. 
 they have a lot of different ones from the norm and they taste fresh
The variety of drinks that they have is also very nice. 
 they were charging dinner prices all day. 
 He did forget to bring our drinks. 
 That was a good thing because I'm eliminating sodas from my daily drinks . 
 Other than that we had a great lunch. 
 Perfect end to an awesome lunch. 
 especially the fish cakes and the radish wraps. 
The food is good. 
Great QUALITY selection of premium meats & seafood. 
 there was a weird taste to it. 
  Food was good. 
 A busser came to take our drink orders because the server was busy. 
I was in a rotten mood when we sat down for dinner because we literally waited an 1. 
FOODS: Great. 
Pro: A wide variety of quality meat and seafood. 
 It's so good and doesn't taste like alcohol. 
 it has odd taste. 
The food was delicious. 
Food was good. 
 Great food and service and I was glad I didn't have to wait
 food was quick. 
As for the food itself. 
 we've tried both dinner menus. 
 Lots of meat varieties and seafood as well. 
 $32 ayce dinner is a bit pricey. 
 the dinner prices are pricey. 
They have a decent selection of banchan (fish cake anyone?) and side dishes. 
  It tasted great and complimented the heaps of korean bbq in my stomach at that point. 
 smoke and sizzling food from all the grills at each table. 
  The manager came by and asked how our evening and meal was at the end of our dinner and thanked us for being there as well as wishing me a happy birthday. 
lounge restaurant type area in the back where you can hang out and get drinks while waiting. 
In terms of the food. 
 think of it as a nice walk to walk off all the food you just ate. 
Lunch: It's about $14. 
 I know they just recently discontinued the steamed egg during lunch time which is a bummer. 
 At some KBBQ restaurants the banchan options are very limited during lunch time. 
 BBQ they still have a pretty big selection whether you visit during lunch or dinner. 
 They usually have a buy one drink get one drink 50% off during lunch time Monday through Thursday. 
Dinner: For $22. 
99 for just the regular dinner selection. 
 Their banchan selection is typically larger during dinner time. 
 Employees here are always willing to refill you drinks. 
 Went here for lunch which runs about $20 a person with drinks. 
 I heard dinner is even better (choice-wise). 
 Lunch was no wait around 12:30 pm during the weekday. 
 I loved the fact that they were changing out our grill consistently so we didnt get the charred taste from cooking the meats. 
The food. 
 and the Scallop were the seafoods that we had. 
At least they have a bar in the back where you can grab some drinks and apps to kill the time. 
The quality of the food is very good for AYCE KBBQ. 
 I went during lunch hours so the price was about $16. 
Food: Less fat on the meat. 
Went on a weekday during lunch time so there was no crowd and the meal was cheaper being $15 for the lunch special. 
 The down side of this is that they didn't taste too good. 
 it tasted like it was watered down or similar to the broth made from instant noodle packets. 
 fish cake. 
We had a la cart food from the lunch menu which still came with banchan. 
 They didn't even bother with offering us rice so it was a protein packed dinner with little servings of ban chan. 
 The dinner was actually a great deal at $23. 
Came here for my sisters bday lunch on a Tuesday. 
 and getting you all the food you need. 
 probably during lunch time. 
 because lunch is only $15. 
 we already knew what we wanted so we ordered our meat and drinks right away. 
 I had to track someone down for our drinks. 
 maybe for lunch when it shouldn't be as busy or hectic. 
- - food - -
 dip in the sauces provided for an extra taste. 
 it makes it taste that much better. 
i don't know why i thought this tasted so good. 
 i swear there was a different taste added to this steamed egg compared to other restaurants. 
 not only for the food. 
 I was referring to the yummy food. 
 the food and the service were exceptional. 
 I think it's around $24 for the basic dinner AYCE. 
especially because there is a bar (The Back Room) connected to it so that you can hang out and get a drink to whet your appetite. 
 My BF started adding stuff to it to make it taste better. 
The food was yummy. 
  The food also came out pretty quick which is awesome. 
 I'm not a huge drinker. 
  But considering how good the food is here. 
 I noticed some plates of brisket tasted almost marinaded while others didn't. 
Would I want to try my luck at dinner?  Probably not. 
 After two rounds of drinks our buzzer went off. 
99 dinner menu. 
 The food and the service were on point. 
 About 90 minutes of gut-busting food gorging finished me. 
However the downside is that their prices for dinner sky rocket which is a big increase from their reasonable lunch price 
All that trouble and the Food 
 we've come early to beat the dinner crowd. 
  Really great KBBQ food and drink and service all around. 
 your drinks. 
99USD dinner price. 
 drink a couple shots of soju and enjoy the welcoming atmosphere that Mr. 
This restaurant is a little bit pricier than most of the K-town AYCE KBBQ places with the lowest tier of their dinner menu being priced at $22. 
  I believe you can order drinks too (non alcoholic). 
  I came through on the weekend so there wasn't the usual lunch deal of 14. 
  I had Eight a couple of days ago (which specializes in pork belly and even that didn't taste as good as this). 
 and the food was pretty good (on the same level as other KBBQ places). 
(Last note: the weekend AYCE price is the dinner price: $20. 
 Lunch: $15)
FOOD. 
 food is delish. 
 Food and service are A1 top notch. 
 When they came around for our third round saying that it's the last time we could order food because they were closing soon. 
 there was no way we could finish all of the food. 
The wait during lunch time is around 10-15 minutes which isn't bad at all. 
 There are also FOUR types of pork belly on the lunch menu and they were all fantastic. 
I love this place and will definitely be back for the fine service and delicious food. 
 and you can drink while you wait for your table. 
 they actually have a big waiting area where you can actually order drinks & play some board games to make the time pass by quicker. 
 The food was whatever taste like any other Korean bbq place. 
Food: Best Korean bbq joint in Orange County. 
  It seems like their marination it spot on with the meat or seafood they offer. 
 The quality of their meat here just tastes a lot better than a lot of places I've been to. 
 Their seafood was also very spot on. 
 they definitely know how to prep a mean kbbq dinner. 
Service: Their food is what keeps me coming back . 
 Their food is amazing and their customer service is even better. 
99 for premium menu (for dinner) 
The prices for dinner 1 is around $23 and to upgrade to dinner 2 is about $30. 
 There are better quality meat of course in dinner 2. 
 For lunch you can also order dinner menu so don't you worry. 
 very great place for family dinners. 
Food:  oh my goodness everything is definitely super DieLicous. 
 the taste in the meat in the way its marinated and the way they do things is so organized and no clusterF**** 
Great food and way better than Gen BBQ . 
Food: 
* Drinks: They have beer towers here. 
 and yummy food
If you were to do a blind taste test with the meat here and from another KBBQ place. 
 Meat tastes like any other meat. 
 it tasted great . 
 along with drinks. 
 We probably got about 2-3 plates of brisket because it's quick to cook and it tastes great. 
 After a couple drinks. 
 perhaps the change in taste is to shed light on my upcoming trip to Korea? Lol. 
 Maybe I'll try to go during lunch to avoid the crazy crowds. 
 Wish I could've rated the food. 
 Also the pricing is on the higher end of kbbq with dinner low at $20 per person. 
 The beef belly is like little fatty pieces of meaty perfection - it's really hard to describe taste lol. 
You cook the food yourself on a table with a grill. 
 The waiter was very friendly and explained the process a d regularly came back to change our grill because the food gets burnt on them. 
 wait for food to be cooked. 
 the food. 
 The two stews we got? Oh my god? Do you people even know what its supposed to taste like? No. 
 Tasted it once and didnt touch it again. 
 you handled the lunch rush so well. 
The food here is always superb. 
  Go to the bar on the other side of the building to get a drink or two while you're waiting. 
  The premium is pretty awesome too - you'll be able to get seafood options. 
Food Selection: 5 Stars
  Go at lunch when the line is more reasonable. 
THE FOOD: 
One thing I will say is that they took off the mr BBQ meat and egg soup off their lunch menu. 
 guess I just have to come back for dinner. 
 I've had my fair share of lunches and dinners here. 
 If you come for dinner & have a long wait. 
 Good place to kill time & have a few drinks. 
The standard PAYCE on weekends is the dinner on weeknights. 
 We tried every beef and seafood option on the list and threw in the Teriyaki chicken as well. 
 which had a great taste. 
  Christine seriously has made me question every putting up with the way sub par service we have gotten here and there for the sake of decent food. 
   We decided on the all you can eat lunch which is reasonably priced at $14. 
The service was fantastic and the quality of meat was fresh tasted great and seemed to be of the highest quality. 
The only negative is they do not have a soda fountain and only serve their soft drinks in a can. 
 I didn't want to waste the food. 
As for the food. 
 We had to take half of our food to-go. 
 If you don't care for the quality of the food or service and just want to watch a football game. 
 the pineapple did not taste fresh and might have been straight out of a can. 
 the pizza was layered with way too much cheese which masked any other flavors except the strange pineapple taste. 
 I can see myself stopping by for appetizers and a drink. 
 ours and ignored us for over twenty minutes without one person even coming up to ask what we would like to drink. 
 let alone order food. 
 received food and drinks. 
I can't say anything bad about free food. 
 It had a weird taste to it. 
 The drinks could do better. 
 There was nothing wrong with the whiskey portion of the drink. 
 I couldn't tell what I was drinking. 
 we saw that they set aside a glass of coke to make their drinks. 
 The server was nice about it and went back to the kitchen to get another glass of coke to make our drinks. 
 i feel sorry for whoever orders the next drink that needs coke. 
 I hate to say although we really like the food we will not be returning to this location. 
 and the food was decent. 
Three stars for food. 
 along with the food and drinks. 
 Not only was she completely absent when trying to order food . 
 I just wanted the quality of the food to match. 
 I had looked down at my watch and realized we had been here for over 15 minutes without so much as an acknowledgment from a server let alone a drink order being placed. 
  As I looked around I noticed that all 3 other booths seated after us had drinks and servers coming to the tables to take orders. 
The only plus for the night was the delicious In & Out Burger for saving the day and finally allowing us the food and beverage we so craved. 
They have a wide variety of food to choose from. 
 service and food was outstanding . 
We ordered a bunch of happy hour food (HH ends at 7 pm) and the food came out hot and fresh. 
 food was tasty. 
The best part of the whole experience is definitely the food. 
 We began with soft drinks and garlic knots (my fave. 
 The drinks came out quickly - then the knots. 
 Here comes the food. 
 The lady who sat us was also running food. 
 we enjoy our food. 
 a large meat pizza and a few rounds of drinks. 
Expect to wait even longer for your food. 
 a solid 15-20 for drinks. 
Mediocre food and beers on tap. 
The food was slighty on par with BJs and Yardhouse. 
 or other bar inspired foods. 
 so our food was going to take longer. 
 especially since we came just as the rush of the dinner crowd came. 
  Bartender hubby made me a strong drink. 
 he made me another drink. 
 we didn't have any food in our new place because we just moved in. 
All of the foods were piping hot. 
  We went to the one in Tustin by our house and we weren't impressed with the food or service. 
  Food. 
Food: 5. 
  We sat at the bar and trying to find our waitress the entire time we were there after she took our food orders was a mission in itself. 
Food is 4. 
It was a slow day and it took forever for the food to come out and 10 minutes for a scoop of ice cream?. 
 The food was good. 
 Average bar type restaurant food. 
Now for the food. 
 The bread and beef itself was just too dry and tasteless I couldn't finish start on the second slider. 
 Frozen wings taste better. 
 dry and tasteless. 
 If I ever get dragged back here and forced to order a pizza yet alone their food. 
 I rather just watch them at home and enjoy better food from the freezer isle. 
every time we come here the food is really good and the service is good as well. 
As for the food. 
As far as food goes. 
  My husband had the fish tacos and he said they were good as well. 
 We were seated fairly quickly and given our menus and we're able to get in one round of drinks in before happy hour ended. 
 almost like drinking water. 
 I tasted the lemon that I squeezed in more than the beer. 
I also ordered the fish and chips which were (surprise. 
 just like the fish. 
 the fish was much better mostly because the tartar sauce had a nice flavor to it. 
 My friend ended up getting the chicken parmesan that looked like something out of a banquet dinner box. 
 Her chicken parm was cold and tasted like it was just microwaved. 
 Their coleslaw was brown and tasted like it was made days ago and was just sitting out drying up waiting for someone to order it. 
 I had almost all of my food left and she didn't even offer a box. 
 Then all the "What happened?" "What's wrong?" "Was it the food?" questions started. 
Oggi's does a lunch special from 11am-4pm. 
 Before ordering from the lunch special menu. 
 I asked my server if I was allowed to use my VIP card with the lunch special. 
 I also ordered a drink that was 2. 
49 for the drink(the drink was ok). 
 apparently you can't use the VIP card with the lunch special. 
Two massive breaded and fried chicken breast pieces pounded down and severed on top of pasta that unfortunately was served with the same tasteless sauce. 
 Food was inedible. 
Today at lunch. 
  This is lunch folks--we don't have all day. 
  Good food. 
One time we watched the assistant manager smoke a cigarette and chit chat with the manager outside while my food order was wrong. 
 I need to go back to focusing on the food. 
 Come in for happy hour to get good food & drink specials. 
You can get a similar menu at a much better value and taste elsewhere in Fullerton. 
I took my roommate here today for lunch and we were both extremely hungry. 
 The hostess finally emerged from the kitchen to give 3 people waiting with their to-go food and seated us. 
 may give their take-out a try since the food is quite tasty. 
 The food was cold. 
 and the fries tasted like they been sitting for a while. 
 I managed to sit at the bar until 10:08 without being acknowledged  or offered a drink. 
The entrees just taste like any other typical brewery pizza spot- nothing special.

 in the end it was the food that was mediocre. 
 We were greeted promptly at the desk and our waiter was quite prompt with menus and taking our drink order. 
 Had to ask for silverware and napkins twice and when my friend arrived took forever to get someone's attention to get him a beer and food. 
 Highly disappointed in service food was enough to give them 2 stars. 
 ^^ not going to complain too much on free food
 they have great food and beer too. 
The mini cheesecake dessert is worth saving room for as well and definitely check out the lunch specials. 
 when I arrived I did not get my food until 1:16pm all while people who were walk ins waited in line. 
 got their food and left all the time I was there waiting for my food because it wasn't ready. 
 my food order was incorrect & missing items. 
I love Panda Express for their food . 
So on to the food. 
 The food didn't leave me wanting more or thinking what I want on my next visit. 
 ran out of food. 
  Unfortunately no other half decent Chinese fast food around the area. 
 it tasted pretty bad. 
 I decided to be nice since the food was delicious and fresh and give you 2 stars. 
Then the line to order food is horrifically long. 
  They have only 2 people working behind the counter during dinner rush hour. 
 and can't restock food items fast enough. 
 15 minutes to order my food. 
  My chow mein noodles were burnt and tasted smoky gross. 
  And my egg roll tastes like a hot dog. 
TASTE:
 don't make up for lame food. 
It's now 24 minutes into the lunch rush and 5 customers have been waiting off to the side for their selections to be cooked. 
 never seen one so poorly staffed and run especially at lunch time. 
The food was awesome
 What I really liked is that when I went to pay the cashier attending me gave me a free drink because we decided to wait :) which was nice. 
  There were like 3 servers on the food line and the 1st lady (American gal) seems pretty nice and doesn't skimp. 
The 2nd staff  (old Chinese lady) who worked at the main section of the food line. 
 I left the store with a pretty bad taste. 
  All in all it was a successful trip to a chain fast food place. 
 Food? Whoever the cooks are. 
-great taste(consistent to other Panda Expresses)
  Food is always reliable and service is typically exceptional and right on point. 
  I just ask for half the amount of starch and its still more than enough food. 
 panda express food is the same . 
thats why if i want american i go to mcdonalds and if i want chinese fast food. 
  It tasted OK. 
  The tangy taste is sooooo good when fresh. 
 they were trying to sell what they had as to not waste food. 
  That's some stiff fast food competition for you my friends. 
I've previously only taken breakfast pastries or drinks to-go and this is my first time dining in at this location. 
 We placed our order and sat down to wait for our food to come. 
 Quite the regret upon the arrival of our food. 
 I am a little disappointed at the server because despite looking at our food as he brought it to us. 
 No one wants to eat at a dirty place and while your pastries and food selections may be good. 
 She also let me keep my outside food (which you are apparently not allowed??. 
- I ordered my food online. 
 as I was going here on my lunch break and wanted to go in and out as quickly as possible. 
- I wasted my entire lunch at this place waiting on my order. 
The food is what you would expect at any other location and the layout is very similar to many other Panera locations. 
 The food was what you would expect. 
  It tasted like they drenched the salad with vinegar. 
  It left an unpleasant aftertaste. 
Food- Decent
 If you order a drink. 
Breakfast recommendation: asiago bacon egg and cheese. 
     I would avoid this Panera location like the Plague because you'll get the Plague since they don't cook their food at the proper temperature. 
 I came here with my boyfriend for dinner. 
 When they brought us our food everything was in order. 
 No ice for drinks. 
The food is great. 
 food tasty. 
Then when we got our food I ordered the lentil quinoa broth bowl it was only 1. 
The food however. 
 good food. 
 And the breakfast sandwiches are good. 
Another time I wanted a while for a cashier to figure something out on the register and she gave me a free drink while I waited. 
 Customer service there is great and I haven't had any issues with my food at all. 
 it super soft and tastes really fresh. 
 The food also comes out pretty quickly which is always a plus. 
 Just a salad with a cup of soup and a small drink was just over $15 bucks. 
 which is a little high in my opinion when it's not really a sit down dinner kind of place. 
 you don't have a server and you get your own drinks. 
 It was very clear that they used some sort of powder to mix this drink together. 
 There was this weird chemical-like taste from the powder as well. 
 It used to taste great when I first started getting them from Panera. 
 They would taste rather old as well - the croissant. 
 and it was like drinking syrup. 
 It tasted good. 
 I was still hoping for the green tea taste as well. 
 Their food and drinks are awful. 
 I eat dinner about five hours later. 
  The food remains pretty much the same. 
 Well my food came out before I even was able to get my drink. 
 It took so long that my food came out and the server was trying to find me. 
My friend waited about 20 minutes for her food and I waited with her to be polite. 
 food comes out and it's Corn Chowder. 
Friday: I go somewhere else because the line during the lunch rush isn't worth having to wait for them to fix my order. 
 I prefer their bread loaves over their actual food. 
 When I picked up the food today. 
I picked up my food today at 12:30pm. 
Best thing about this location (other than the usual rah-rah I would add about Panera's food. 
drink) is it's huge and the staff don't bother you if you're there for hours working on a project. 
I have no idea about their food or products they sell. 
 make sure you get the rewards cards to collect points and get yourself a free pastry or drink. 
or a quick and kind-of-cheap lunch. 
The food is great. 
We ordered a refillable soft drink and a muffin to share. 
Came during lunch and ordered for my brother and mom. 
Ultimately the food here isn't quality and their panini's aren't even crunchy. 
Since this website is all about the review of FOOD. 
 I also had some food. 
 I think the bread at the Huntington Beach location just tastes better. 
The food was decent. 
 if you're there for the sole purpose of eating or drinking. 
I love that I am suggested to try new things and that employees are incredibly knowledge about their food. 
Mac and Cheese is uncomfortable comfort food. 
 Drinkable. 
 Almost tasted like there was soy in there. 
I knew exactly what I wanted and I knew it would taste ok. 
I found both the quality of the food and the service to be inconsistant here. 
 I ended up paying about $22 for lunch for me and my brother. 
  But if you really want quality food and don't mind too much about costs. 
 unfortunately if you go during lunchtime or dinnertime. 
 shouldn't it be great?  Soup tasted like from a can. 
 i was looking at the cranberry orange smoothie that was hanging from the ceiling and the cashier said my freebie today was a free drink. 
 Because I don't like the taste of yogurt too much. 
 pretty pricey for the taste and quality. 
I would want to recommend the spinach souffle for breakfast. 
 not too much for a breakfast. 
The food is good. 
 not 21 dollars for a two lunches good. 
I was intrigued by some of their breakfast sandwich offerings (egg sandwiches and the like) . 
 which is when they stop serving breakfast. 
-The drink area is messy
 drink. 
 and cookie was over $15 during lunch. 
 The food is way over priced. 
Got my food delivered to the table and they gave me a bag of chips instead of the apple. 
BOTTOM LINE: Dropping almost $10 for lunch (especially when it's a half salad. 
 although tasty was not impressive than a heart alertos breakfast burrito. 
  They offer a lot of teas and drink choices. 
 almost and equal arsenal to the food menu. 
They have decent food. 
  If you need food. 
 My first college lunch date awhile back. 
 I had to go to the counter since 15 minutes passed and my food wasn't there. 
 there are also people on business lunches so I didn't feel like I was in a completely casual zone. 
best I've ever tasted. 
Whether you want to grab a quick lunch or study all day long. 
 this is the perfect place because you can have breakfast. 
 lunch. 
 and dinner and never have to leave your study spot. 
 But I came here for breakfast yesterday morning with my friend and was totally let down. 
I ordered the Breakfast Power sandwich. 
 I dont think the food here is THAT great. 
 and drinks filled up my nose and made my mouth water. 
As i made my way up to the register i didn't know what to get as they had so many wonderful selections and the friendly worker suggested their lunch combo. 
Panera bread is the perfect place to do lunch with a friend to just catch up or study up for a quiz while pigging out on some tasty delectable goods whether it be salty or sweet. 
The food always taste fresh and good. 
I would've gave them 4 stars for the fresh food and good soup . 
Thanks Panera for fresh food and delicious soup . 
 went for breakfast today. 
 The green tea is syrupy and doesn't taste like tea. 
I also like that it's a casual sit-down restaurant: more classy than a  fast-food joint . 
We love coming here because we can come when we are sweaty and gross right after the gym or come in for a quick cheap lunch or dinner. 
 I will come to have lunch with friends and chit chat. 
 From the interior design to the food served to all the little perks. 
 Gotta drink it while it's hot. 
 Lunchtime brings in all the local students and parking can be a pain. 
 If you are into healthy food this is the spot. 
 lunch with friends. 
 The food is very good and healthy enough to not feel guilty. 
 For breakfast they offer bagels. 
 and breakfast sandwiches. 
 For lunch and dinner they have an assortment of both hot and cold salads. 
 The sun-dried tomato ale with mustard gives a very unique taste which compliments the bacon and smokehouse turkey perfectly. 
 You order your food at the counter. 
 they bring your food and so far I have not had any problems. 
  I'm just hating because I was thinking about having a healthier lunch. 
 It had a taste of yogurt in it which was pretty good and tasted healthy. 
  They seem to focus on having fresh organic foods that are light and health conscious. 
  But the food seems to be pretty good. 
A little pricier for a simple breakfast or lunch. 
 the food quality and great service is well worth the extra $$. 
 Ordered the Smokehouse Turkey  Panini as well and you can really taste the quality. 
 I think the bacon was smoked with applewood because you could taste the sweetness. 
 On top of the good food the girl at the cashier was really cool. 
  The food is mediocre. 
 the food and service are bleh. 
 Their cookies taste like junior high. 
 she delivers your food. 
  We were still hungry after we finished our "snacks" so we ended up getting more food somewhere else. 
  The quality of the food was good as usual. 
The breakfast that I get includes a plain bagel with cream cheese. 
 They seem to be doing a better job at keeping plain bagels on hand as when I stopped by for breakfast last Saturday around 10 they still had some. 
It's not quite clear when they change over from breakfast menus to lunch and then to dinner. 
I had the three cheese crispani for dinner one night. 
 it tasted alright. 
 this place just did not tickle my tummy in all the right places and definitely didn't seduce my tastebuds. 
 if youre looking for taste and quality. 
 It was too much food. 
 But the price is compensated by their cleanliness in their decor and food. 
 I found their lunch special to not only be tasty . 
  All lunch specials come with an egg roll and a small portion of fried rice. 
If you're in the area for lunch and looking for some pho I would recommend this place. 
Food: I loved the taste of the flavorful broth & tender brisket. 
 definitely would recommend this joint if you're craving Vietnamese food in Fullerton. 
The dining room is clean and the lights are dim and inviting for you to stay awhile and enjoy the food. 
now to my food. 
 overall the food is great. 
The food is okay. 
 I come during the lunch special when they give you the extra eggroll & friend rice along with your pho. 
 They just take your order & give you your food . 
 bf ordered the seafood pho. 
 The sauce didn't really taste like the peanut sauce I was used to. 
Had some of the boyfriend's seafood pho. 
 and the broth tasted a lot better. 
 seafood was the frozen. 
They have an awesome combo deal for lunch and dinner where you can get your choice of pho with an egg roll and fried rice for about $1 more depending on which one you choose. 
 Food - Just your average Vietnamese BBQ pork
  I went with friends before the lunch rush (approximately 11:30am). 
Menu: There is a special lunch menu that has 3 items (ranging from pho and appetizer or vermicelli and appeteizer for around $10). 
 and everything else tasted bland. 
The noodles were great - I liked the texture and taste. 
 But the broth lacked flavor and tasted weak. 
 I recommend coming here for their lunch specials. 
 Even though service was friendly and they bring the food out to you in a timely manner. 
 the lack of taste was bothersome. 
 I couldn't even drink water without it coming back out until around 6-7 PM the next day. 
 Below average food (besides the Pho). 
 The seafood omelette is ok . 
My food came fairly quickly. 
 The food was delicious. 
A+ food. 
I had the seafood pho which hit the spot. 
 foods taste good. 
We will drive littler further to get cheaper and about the same quality food. 
This place average food price is $9~$10. 
My bf ordered the BBQ pork rice under my recommendation cause no place that claims to be vietnamese can mess up that grilled pork with the tasty fish sauce drizzle. 
 appearance and taste wise. 
Food 4. 
spices or water down the fish sauce. 
 all the food is missing some kind of flavor maybe to cater to a certain palate. 
 All in all a great hole in the wall for authentic vietnamese food. 
The only minor detail that may have distorted my taste buds then was that I was pretty hungover. 
Anyway this place did an amazing job to cure my hangover and also created a great eating experience with quality food. 
 She said it tasted okay. 
 On to the food. 
 It's probably just a personal reaction I have to something in the food and not their fault. 
You can tell you are eating fresh food and not pre-package from the local vendor. 
 and my friend ordered a fish curry rice dish that was delicious. 
They just didn't have some other Vietnamese food items and beverages. 
 they did not stray from the real taste of traditional dishes. 
 I had to raise my hand and wave it side to side in order to be noticed so that our food can be brought out. 
 and the explanation of people wanting a relaxing environment and enjoy dinner. 
 *enjoy what dinner? It hasn't even been brought out. 
In conclusion this establishment has horrible service for mediocre food. 
 You receive a friendlier environment at any other food restaurant. 
 For the price I paid here I could go to Pho 45 at Garden Grove (excellent place) and eat twice and with a real pho taste. 
 Who knows what she would do to my food. 
My side of veggies tasted old and cost $2. 
 It tasted like eggs and white rice. 
 both tasted like something was missing. 
 fish sauce was very light as well. 
 the food wasn't good. 
 Nothing special about the food here and the small bowl of Pho is tiny compared to the small or regular sized bowls at other nearby Pho houses. 
 I always feel I pay too much and get too little food at this place and their sister restaurant. 
 Lunch here the other day will also be my last. 
While their food is not BLOW ME AWAY DELICIOUS. 
 and the people here are very attentive and the food is WELL PRICED. 
Really affordable yummy food. 
 I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for the whole meal--it was a very strong salty taste--. 
 I took a tentative sip of the new glass of water he brought me and it tasted like soap. 
When the food came out. 
 The food speaks for itself. 
 this restaurant has probably a similar taste to that. 
 and they have lunch specials for less than 10 dollars which includes small pho. 
 It tasted watered down as if they just filled the pot with water when it was running low. 
 Didn't taste the spices or that hint of pork bones. 
 I think we got a steal for all the food we got. 
Food: mediocre
Food. 
I like to eat my pho plain and simple--to really taste all the flavors. 
 Taste-wise. 
 In this gap was all sorts of nasty food and trash particles that probably hasn't been cleaned out in god knows how long. 
Didn't wait long for the food and the food was so flavorful. 
The spring special for dinner is perfect . 
 well with some fish. 
 I should only rate this place for the food. 
  I'd give a hole in the wall a 5 star if the food was fantastic. 
 2 drinks = $22. 
 Food. 
 The carrot slices kind of tasted like soap. 
 Charged full price for food we barely ate for something they had control over. 
 the quality of food was not up to a standard. 
 and food came out reasonably quickly. 
 that's enough food. 
 Will return for their lunch special (M-F $5. 
The food itself was really good. 
 The only thing I put in my Pho is a little bit of lime juice after I taste the broth. 
I know that she hates to eat Vietnamese food
But tonight my taste buds she wants to please
That put the taste buds in my mouth ill at ease
the food's good . 
 taste was fine. 
  Overall the food was very good and service was friendly and prompt. 
 and comfy booths and they have extremely eclectic taste in music. 
Foodwise. 
 I am extremely sensitive to food containing MSG - I get a headache. 
stomach ache immediately after consumption- so I am amble to confidently say that Pho Olivia does not use any MSG in their food because I have not felt these symptoms any time that i've dined here. 
healthy food. 
 Just as the food. 
 the beef didn't taste to fresh. 
 I had the spring rolls without mint (the only thing I don't eat) and it tasted bland. 
 It tasted like coconut meat. 
My friends & I frequent this place a lot for it's good food and friendly. 
 this is also the only Vietnamese restaurant i go to where I have ordered food other than Pho. 
NO MSG = missing pho sweetness = not quite authentic taste
 the food is excellent. 
Seafood - Yes. 
  Wham bam thank you ma'am I had my food--all with that lovely smile. 
Food
  I will pay higher prices for great tasting food. 
 and once you order seafood. 
 Hopefully I just came in on a bad day and that normally food taste awesome here. 
 I've tasted the croque monsieur and chicken curry skewers. 
FOOD AND VALUE
  That was some of the most tender chicken I've ever had from an asian food grill. 
FOOD: 2 star
 the broth was so clear that it literally felt like I was drinking hot watered down soup that had no richness to it. 
Definitely regretted getting this cause not only was the spring roll's rice paper kinda hard and super chewy on my end (it's suppose to be soft when fresh) and the fillings inside where so sparse that you literally just taste the noodles and pieces of mint. 
 It was taste-less and unappetizing. 
 all they pretty much did was just take your order and drop off your food at your table. 
 and tasted even better. 
 and the taste of the coconut milk in the egg was not at all overpowering. 
 The chargrilled taste of the pork was an A+. 
 The shrimp released taste with every chew. 
The owner was clearly delighted to see us enjoy her food and takes well earned pride in it. 
  It doesn't taste overly salty like other places. 
  All the food is very fresh and so far everything we've ordered has been equally as good. 
 we were very happy with our dinner. 
 and we're both originally from the San Gabriel area which is like the mecca of all Asian related foods so I've had plenty of pho. 
 The broth didn't taste too sweet or anything. 
 Food is great and service is great. 
 lunch was dissatisfying for me that day. 
 it did become pretty watered down to the point where I could barely taste the flavor of the Thai Tea. 
 The serving size was quite generous and the food itself came to me quickly. 
 The presentation of the food itself was nice. 
 the servers still helped us and served us with a smile and were even able to refill my drinks almost instantly. 
 their food was also excellent. 
  This restaurant is a very cozy and romantic setting if you want to go out for lunch or a date. 
 tastes best) and it's usually the perfect size. 
 Within a handful minutes of sitting down they took my order and my food was at the table. 
 that's because normally when I go out for food I go to where my friends are which is other parts of Fullerton and the surrounding cities. 
 casual with a very mild formal taste. 
 Never tasted broth like it before. 
Taste:  Fair. 
  Will probably opt for a dirtier place for better food next time. 
 My sister then asks for just the milktea that is the basic tea you drink boba with. 
 We get our food. 
And the best part? The whole time we were eating our food. 
 all the servers basically disappeared into the kitchen or back room somewhere after we got our food. 
 I honestly could not get over how great my pho tasted that day. 
 I took another two bites after that because I could not get over how good the rice tasted. 
 my pho did not taste as great as the first time. 
 The broth had tasted a little different and not as rich. 
Food: 10. 
 Food arrived within minutes of orders (literally the fastest sit down service I've ever had). 
 they wanted to have dinner here. 
 The food is amazing. 
I wasn't sure what to get so I just ordered the same as my friend (veggie and tofu pho and young coconut water [?] to drink). 
 everything tasted good. 
 the produce appeared and tasted fresh. 
This food establishment is located in a dingy dirty strip mall. 
 for the amount of food you get the price is worth it. 
They have a cheesy singer with a guitar on Friday nights which kinda ruined my dinner. 
food was still good though. 
My food was served rather on the cool side. 
 or lemon before scooping up a spoonful of the broth to taste. 
 not too much star anise taste or smell. 
  The food is just what I expect to get and tasty. 
Highly recommend anyone who wants to eat good vietnamese food to come here. 
- Was excited to drink the thai ice tea . 
 The tea itself tasted extremely watered down and the boba was all crumbled up and weird at the bottom. 
 Told them in the nicest way possible with a smile that it tasted watered down thinking maybe they just messed up on this one drink. 
 The waiter just poured more of the same bland drink in after removing some of the ice. 
I love the lunch specials. 
  The broth tasted clean. 
 it's a good local place with good food and the restaurant was clean. 
 they still tasted fine. 
Food was good. 
 chicken and seafood. 
 I know the taste when I try it. 
On to the food. 
 The broth tastes very clean and the quality of meat is excellent. 
Let's talk about the food now. 
 food. 
 even for our drinks (&& we were the only customers there . 
-) The food was ehh also. 
 I'm a soda drinker. 
 It tasted the SAME. 
 & I didn't even drink it. 
The food was excellent. 
 ask our opinion on the food. 
Food is always tasty and good. 
  Here you get good food and good service with an ambience of RELAX . 
 One waiter also had pretty good service and came to refill our drinks without being asked. 
 I looked for drinks such as my usual soda chanh muoi (pickled lemon soda) and soda sua hot ga (egg soda) . 
  Everything tastes very fresh and clean. 
I like the food here they have really good dough and toppings very fresh and great tasting . 
 sausage  and all the topping tasted really good way better quality than other pizza places . 
 you go down the food line to create your meal. 
 The pizza tasted as good as it looked. 
 and mouthwatering good taste. 
My friend and I agreed on a late lunch and arrived at 3 PM. 
For the price and the amount of food I get on my personal pizza. 
Good food - loud place. 
 During lunch times. 
 Wild Thoughts run through my mind as I try to remember what the last slice I ate tasted like. 
 food has arrived and i sit stagnant as i stare at what I have wanted for months. 
The crust is super thin and the pizza taste really good. 
 it's like $8 for the pizza and with a drink it's about $10. 
The staff and food here are the best. 
 if you hit lunch. 
dinner time. 
 great food. 
ter and Red Sauce (Tastes GREAT together) 
 I went on a Sunday and had a early dinner so there wasn't much of a line. 
 Huge dinner rushes probably come and go. 
 I'd consider it fast food. 
 it tastes a lot better than you 'd expect and definitely a go-to. 
 quality of the food is pretty good for a medium sized pizza with unlimited toppings. 
 A pizza dinner that you can customize with your own toppings that costs around $10 is not only delicious. 
- the taste of the food is better than other places I've been
 Just order your pizza and drink and have a sat. 
 you serve yourself drinks so it's all you can drink. 
 so that way you know where to deliver the food instead of walking around looking all lost calling out David. 
  we ended up having way too much food left over. 
  Anyone who loves having the ability to customize their food will fall in love with this place. 
You can customize your own food. 
 the fountain drink tasted like wax. 
Because of their decline to level of 'fast food' mentality. 
Awesome taste. 
 I cant wait for lunch so I can eat the other half of the pie I ordered and ate half of yesterday. 
This is definitely going to be one of my go to lunch places in the area. 
Pieology tastes better then the competition. 
 the pizza was runny and very bland compared to how it tasted when they first opened. 
 the line was pretty long because I went during lunch time. 
 its a great deal here for lunch and dinner. 
Food:  SO GOOD. 
 The sauce was tasted very watery. 
7:07pm: Ok so the food came out really fast. 
 But I was disappointed that I could not get a good taste of the red sauce. 
 I probably would not return as compared to other pizzas I have tasted. 
 the way he commented about my pizza (which tasted devine by the way) was intently rude. 
  Expect to wait in line for about 20-30 min during dinner time. 
  I couldn't really taste anything. 
For the food. 
My Verdict is that the pizza tasted alright. 
 my foodie ego says "Man Vs Food finish it. 
 Pieology exploded onto the OC foodie scene very much like how Michael exploded onto the tennis scene a few decades ago. 
 especially during lunch hour. 
FOOD: I always choose my own toppings. 
 good food. 
 The line gets really long during peak dinner time. 
I tasted the other pizzas that my group created and the sausages were delish as well as the roasted peppers and pepperoni. 
 just like this place which kind of re-invents a very old food concept. 
 drinks and ding dongs (Yeah. 
  I prefer to taste my toppings vs eating a gutbuster Pizza Hut version that is all crust. 
 The greatest part is that it truely tastes fresh. 
 once I tasted my first slice. 
 the toppings tasted great. 
  Although they also have bottled drinks. 
The food is probably more like a four star. 
I prefer the taste of 800 degrees in Westwood's crust. 
Great Food
 tasted good and had all the crap I like. 
 just eat it and remember next time to tell them to cook it just a little longer  4+****Star food
 that you can customize to suit your on tastes. 
 I just love the concept and how fast and delicious the food is. 
 you would be able to fully appreciate the tastes that comes with them. 
 if you need your quiet time during a romantic dinner this is NOT the place for you. 
 Expect to see people of all backgrounds enjoy their food and buddies. 
Food. 
Drinks: The good thing about these type of places is that the food can taste good or bad. 
 filling lunch. 
dinner. 
 I'm giving a 4 for the food. 
Food: 
Drinks: 
Bottled drinks or refillable soft drinks on the side
 it was my first time and it was really rude that they didn't even give me 5 seconds to pick my food. 
 We liked the pizza so much we were even craving the pizza the following day and we considered going back for lunch. 
 this time I had the worst food poisoning. 
  I have never had food poisoning before so this was a traumatic experience for me. 
I'd classify pieology as a fast food joint. 
 you order off a board and have your food in about 10 minutes. 
 the place can get packed around lunch time. 
 They bake a smaller pizza and toss it some cinnamon sugar and glaze for a great after dinner treat. 
 it's a clever food option for the hungry college student. 
 tastes kinda like Blaze
 the pizzas taste very similar. 
 I went back to Blaze after and found their taste slightly more in my preference. 
 there was seating and the food was ready. 
 Recommended for any lunch or dinner when craving pizza. 
 You won't get this amazing taste out of any delivery pizzas out there and def not for less than $10. 
I assumed it would take a while to get our food . 
 we got it within like 10-12 minutes after ordering our food. 
it tasted like disappointment
 great taste. 
  If you got $8 to spend for dinner. 
 good food. 
 which they were - if you don't like the taste of the mix of toppings you put on. 
 choose a drink and whether or not you want a ding dong - have a seat and wait for your name to be called - then eat. 
 add a drink and. 
Mozzarella: Tastes like whole milk mozs. 
 after I order for my food to come. 
the taste is indescribable. 
Only downside is that there can be a bit of a line if you go during rush hour lunch time. 
 The cheese was oOey gOoey and the pesto added a creaminess to it that just hit all of my taste buds. 
 a great dinner. 
Don't expect a quiet dinner here. 
We hoped that the taste of our pizza would be so divine that we'd overlook everything else. 
 We found the thin pizza to be a bit undercooked and rather tasteless. 
 savory and pungent notes in my food so this creation really hits the spot. 
As for the taste? What's better than to eat a creation filled with your favorite toppings? 
 for $9 I got a good sized pizza and a drink. 
I used the 10% off yelp deal when I checked into this place as long as I bought a drink so it was all good. 
 I'd say -- about being able to customize your food. 
FOOD:
 the food is great and worth trying if you're craving pizza. 
 luckily the pizza tastes good no matter what you put on it. 
The place was super packed and I thought I'd never get my food. 
 with a drink. 
If you're a true foodie. 
 it was really cold inside the restaurant during dinner time. 
 taste. 
 so much food. 
 The meatball topping was ground up and tasted so good. 
 the food kicked ass. 
  Not sure what that mess was going to taste like. 
  At lunch time. 
  They bring the food to your table. 
 Then guy has us pay and asks if we want drinks. 
 So I got my girlfriend and I two regular drinks. 
 So we're like ok maybe we get our drinks when we get our pizza. 
 We had to ask another guy for the drinks because the other guy was talking to the girl working. 
  They gave us a free drink for a Yelp check-in and would stop by our table to check up on us. 
  If you enjoy drinking beer while eating pizza. 
 There's a subtle taste of garlic. 
 beverages (includes fountain drinks. 
 Check in on Yelp to redeem a free soft drink. 
 let's break down the food. 
  Don't forget to check in on yelp to receive a free fountain drink with your pizza as well. 
 I enjoyed the food. 
 Especially because my mom spilled her drink all over the floor. 
  The pepperoni tastes better here. 
  They should have someone who handle the money and not handle the food as well. 
 the food itself just wasn't doing it for me. 
 tasted more creamy than I was expecting for a pasta salad. 
All that being said about the food and beer. 
# The lines are long during lunch time because they're really new. 
 the most beer-friendly and stereotypical food item. 
# The pizza here makes for a decent lunch. 
 Each personal pizza is a good size that's plenty for lunch. 
 A wider variety of options (both food and drank) make it a little more desirable than its bajillion competitors. 
The food is still great. 
Food was pretty bomb though. 
 They even reminded me of the free drink I could get when I checked in on Yelp. 
What makes this place so good is that it is so fresh and you can taste the quality. 
 the food is great. 
CRUST - Winner: Pizza Press - Something about it just makes the pizza's taste profile better. 
CHEESE - Winner: Pieology - I think the cheese at Pieology tastes better. 
VEGGIES: Pieology's veggies seem to taste more fresh (may be because of the way they're baked). 
 you will get a lot of food. 
OVERALL TASTE: Pizza Press. 
 and I don't feel like I'm in a food coma afterwards. 
 I'm not a drinker. 
 so go drink on your own and find out. 
 I was very satisfied with the food with great customer service as well. 
 I can't finish a ton of food. 
 The taste was very good. 
But how this place beats out Pieology and Blaze is is the cheese is put on better and tastes better. 
 the pizza is too dry for my taste. 
 it still tastes good. 
 Amazing how great it tasted. 
Now to the actual food. 
 couldn't really taste anything else on it and the dipping sauce was ehh. 
 the taste of this pizza was much better. 
 with not super different food. 
 the guy preparing my food was only wearing gloves half the time. 
 I work with food for my job and I know how big of a no-no it is to not be wearing protective gloves when dealing with customers food. 
Overall the taste of the pizza wasn't terrible. 
 4 out of 4 music graduate students approve of the food and the beer. 
 I didn't mention a thing since I'm not one to waste food. 
The food is structured the same way as Pieology or Blaze. 
The food: nicely baked. 
god it was like drinking oil with a hint of dry dough. 
 I was amazed at how fresh the pizza still tasted. 
 the pizza from the Pizza Press tasted like it was still fresh out of the oven. 
 quality ingredients in their food which definitely stands out against places like Blaze Pizza and Pizza Studio. 
 They gave me a 15% discount for being a CSUF  student so dinner ended up being cheaper than Pieology. 
Now the food. 
 I can not taste the sauce like at all. 
 all i tasted was the cheese. 
fast customer service and the quality food. 
 The spice level was non existent and just tastes like a lot of salt. 
 and I seriously hope that this owner learns to take food safety more seriously. 
 has a great fountain drink dispenser. 
I'm still not a fan of the 101 flavor soda machine (every time I use it my soda always seems to have a lingering taste of whatever the person before me had). 
 I'm usually friendly and polite to whoever's making my sandwich (they do have control of my food. 
 and almost like fast food. 
 and pick from about a bajillion drinks. 
 and crazy Coke drinks. 
) I got honey mustard sauce (my usual) on one of my sandwiches and it tasted extremely sour. 
  I come back to the cashier and tell her I think the honey mustard is expired and that it tastes very sour. 
  She says "that's how honey mustard is supposed to taste" with a look on her face like I'm an idiot. 
2 the sandwich I'm really regretting not doing so cause it tastes like shit with the salt. 
 it's easy to get burnt out on Thai food. 
 I'm ready to burn myself out on this Thai food. 
 Like I said hit or miss (50% chance you will get good food): 
You know it's a miss when the pad thai tastes like nothing . 
  Whenever we have our thai food cravings. 
  Reasonable for the amount of food you get. 
 and for the quality of food. 
Food: I personally don't like to try new things lol so I just stick to my favorites. 
 It tasted good with rice mixed in. 
 Right down the street from CSUF which is so nice for the students there to get some authentic Thai food. 
Food:
The check was dropped off with our food. 
 love love love the food. 
But the food is really overpriced considering how little the portion is. 
  The green jasmine tea tasted and smelled like soapy water. 
 the wait time to receive our food was long-at least 40 minutes. 
 it certainly took a loooong time to receive our food. 
Food: I ordered the veggie pad Thai. 
 It was a pretty small portion compared to other Thai restaurants I've gone to and taste-wise. 
Food (ranking): family style. 
 Catfish Curry
 Might have been the first time I've tried catfish to be honest haha
 My friends like spicy food so we chose two non spicy and two spicy. 
Time during a hectic week to make dinner every day. 
 I can't even describe the taste of the soup. 
 fish. 
 The Pad Thai has been really tasty too (PEANUTS IN THIS DISH) They do offer lunch specials . 
 I'll be honest and say I haven't been here for lunch. 
 I do think your kids can take in food from other restaurants . 
 if my kids ever go with me I just might try because of the food allergy situation my son has. 
  The sauce in the fish with ginger and the calamari with basil were both packed with flavor. 
Tips: They can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner. 
FOOD
 The boyfriend tried the lunch special which we both weren't a fan of. 
 I noticed many people that drop by for lunch are regulars - they were addressed by their name and sit at their usual table. 
 We were seated and then left with our menus for a good 10 to 15 minutes with no one coming to get our drink order. 
 Two other parties were sat after us and were served drinks and taken orders before we were. 
returned the food and got my money back. 
Food is served HOT. 
 so we know what real Thai food is and are used to excellent service. 
I think the food still tastes the same which is delicious. 
 then it took about 30 minutes before someone asked if we wanted drinks while a party on the next table were seated about 5 minutes after us and they had their drinks and were able to order and get their food before we even got drinks. 
I personally love their Dinner Specials (Lemon Chicken) They give you so much and it definitely hits the spot. 
 Within five minutes I ordered beef Panang from the dinner menu with sticky rice. 
 The owner told me that he could give me that choice as a lunch with two appetizers. 
 My total lunch price was $11. 
 My only recommendation would be anyone desiring a bigger food serving when ordering lunch buy from the dinner menu at that serving size and price. 
I was finished with lunch by 12:40 PM. 
 they have lunch specials 
 Food is pretty good . 
 add more food. 
The food is absolutely amazing. 
-Decent food and decent prices
-Busy during prime hours(lunch mostly)
 They also have a daily lunch menu with a lot of choices. 
This place is just an authentic Thai restaurant the foods amazing I always come here for the pad Thai or any of the noodle dishes and if I want it spicy hot. 
Overall it's a good place for some real good Thai food
 But hey- everyone has different taste. 
 Also did not taste so great. 
Points for solid Thai food and ambiance. 
 I still love the food. 
 refilling drinks and pre-bussing tables. 
 it makes for a perfect lunch. 
 This place is really busy during dinner and unfortunately it's around that time that service starts to slack a little. 
There's a nice variety of drinks such as Thai tea or Thai iced coffee (highly recommended by the way) and several import and domestic beers. 
In short - good food. 
 busy dinners. 
I'm impressed with how good the service is considering how busy this place gets around dinner. 
 the soup and eggroll with the lunch menu have almost no taste at all whereas the fried wonton was totally average. 
 The pad see ew however had a good amount of taste. 
 the prices are outrageous for Thai food ($9 for most meals plus $2 for a small cup of rice?. 
 Food comes out pretty fast. 
The food wasn't that great enough for me to want to come back anymore and the service was terrible. 
 this is my favorite spot for lunch. 
 tasted way too bland
Spicy eggplant: A little too oily for my tastebuds
Food just didn't taste authentic enough. 
 spicy shrimp fried rice and catfish curry. 
 even during lunch time. 
 my suspicions were confirmed - it tasted like burned oil. 
Deep fried fish cake ($6. 
Thai coffee: not strong and borderline tasteless. 
 Not only is the food delicious and healthy. 
 it costs like $9 for a lunch combo that comes with rice. 
 I suggest dining here - Good prices - great food. 
They recommend  me so strongly 2 try Thai food rite here
This makes me open 2 eat Thai food
Let's get onto the food. 
 I've been to Thailand and I always tell people that most Thai food you get here in the U. 
 Their food is better. 
Helpful ordering information : just tell them how spicy you want your food and that's what you will get. 
 not so much you can't taste the food anymore. 
The food was "okay" to say the least. 
 Between the horrible service and mediocre food this is definitely not on my list to return to. 
 I don't think I've ever had pad thai so tasteless. 
 I found a hair in my food. 
 they have customers because the food is good. 
 I would definitely recommend Thai Basil for anyone craving Thai food in the Fullerton area. 
We found Thai Basil when our usual Thai food restaurant changed hands and the food quality took a dive. 
 The food is always. 
Food suggestions:
Looking at some of the other reviews I'm really surprised to see complaints about the service and the food. 
  They are always friendly and efficient and the food is always delicious. 
  Cloth napkins at dinner time and an actual page-turn menu. 
  Given that both locations do not have the BEST Thai food. 
The food overall seemed bland to me. 
 I'm not sure that lack of flavors equates healthy food. 
 when they made the food in a way they thought an American would like it. 
 Thai food varies depending on which part of the country you are in. 
  Lunch deals are great. 
 though Cal State is only blocks away and a lot of faculty and staff head there for lunch. 
Thai Basil is my favorite Thai food locally. 
 the food was superb. 
 either way the food is great. 
 I was impressed with how it tasted. 
Eggs were perfectly mixed into the noodles so that it had the soy sauce taste in it as well and it didn't just taste like eggs. 
 You really do get the check like 5 minutes after your food is brought to the table. 
 Drinks were refilled once they saw that it was almost empty. 
Typically when I review I compare against other Thai restaurants I've been to and the level of food standard and service. 
One thing that got me confused was that she went out of her way to mention that the lunch menu is available even during dinner. 
  We asked what the difference was and she said the lunch one is smaller. 
  We ordered the dinner portion . 
 when it came out it was clearly the lunch portion. 
The food was not bad. 
Each lunch comes with a small soup (the weakest part of the meal. 
 very busy at lunch time. 
 this place has some really tasty authentic thai food. 
 specially if you love spicy food. 
They had a egg drop soup (included in the lunch special) which was perfect for the chilly weather and their egg rolls and wontons are never overly breaded and crispy. 
 We were all very polite and ordered our food and drinks within 5 minutes of sitting down. 
I will probably give this restaurant another chance because the food was decent. 
 I can only imagine that the reason someone has given Thai Basil a poor rating is because of how crowded it gets and that it may have taken a while for them to get their food. 
 When? Every single day at lunch time. 
 and most always get the food out in a reasonable time is beyond me. 
Food is top notch. 
 Everything I get here tastes wonderful . 
Food can be a bit on the spicy end though. 
 i still feel that the food is spicy. 
Food: 
 They have great dinner and lunch deals that include appetizers and great thai tea. 
 The staff is friendly and quality of food is very tasty. 
 I had Thai food once before at this hole-in-the-wall spot in Anaheim on Gilbert and Lincoln. 
 they give you large portions of food here at Thai Basil. 
 as we were finishing up our foods. 
 Thai food is growing in popularity nowadays. 
 Such delicious food. 
Highly recommend this place for those who love Thai food. 
 or are curious to try out Thai food. 
 Their food packs some heat. 
 Salmon is a fish I hate. 
 it tasted SOUR. 
 It tasted old and I felt like I was going to get food poisoned. 
 they opened up a new milk carton and made me another drink. 
 It tasted better at first. 
 strangely again it started to taste sour. 
 It was kind of them to make me a new drink. 
 I know it's not just me because my boyfriend said it tasted sour. 
BUT it's okay because I care more about food than service. 
Both the sweets and I got the dinner specials which were $12 something and just enough for 1 meal. 
 Since last weekend's early dinner. 
FOOD:
 The food inside the soup was totally lacking. 
The only reason I come here is for the food. 
 Always have Lunch and dinner Specials. 
 Dinner is 12. 
 They are SO nice and go the extra mile to help you box your food and refill your water without asking. 
 i like the service & the food is consistent and tasty enough to satisfy my thai food cravings. 
I had the duck salad for my lunch. 
 You mix it yourself according to your own taste. 
The food is fresh. 
 Taste good every time. 
The food came out in 5 minutes. 
 Seems everyone got their food quickly. 
  With cheap lunches. 
 The food itself was average. 
 and the food was just ok. 
 the food here is OK and decent. 
 and flavorful food. 
 Thai Basil is a great spot to grab a quick bite for lunch or dinner. 
 My family was more annoyed that the waitress just left us boxes for us to box our own food yet the same waitress boxed the food of the table next to us. 
 We have no problems boxing food ourselves . 
  they give you the choice of how spicy you want your food from 1 to 10. 
 If I ever crave thai food. 
 Love their lunch specials. 
I go here whenever I'm craving thai food in the Fullerton area. 
 and food had always been delicious. 
Lunch specials have very good prices and satisfying portions. 
 But at the end of the day it's the food that counts here. 
My usual is the chuka soba lunch combo. 
  Definitely impressed with the quality of the food here. 
My usual drink selection is the iced great tea. 
 "Karaage" (who doesn't love deep fried goodness?) and "Agedashi Tofu" (Crispy yet soft in the middle and the fish broth compliments the tofu very well). 
  Granted my taste buds were just as inebriated as I was. 
 Also the broth at Kopan is way too creamy for my taste. 
I think there are better ramen places (better taste and slightly cheaper) if you go towards LA. 
 always missing Japanese food. 
 not only the taste of food . 
 anything---their quality of the service including the speed of taking order and the time until the food comes. 
 for the taste of food other than Ramens are also good. 
Their lunch specials look pretty awesome. 
 the taste and texture was pretty on par) it was probably the only dish we actually finished. 
 a lunch combo with tonkatsu shoyu ramen and beef bowl. 
 I thought everything tasted pretty good. 
 It tastes like the yoshinoya beef bowl. 
** BUT wouldn't you order your food. 
 receive your food. 
Food:
 We enjoyed our food. 
 My drinks even remained full without having to flag anybody down - try doing that at Santouka. 
 after the food coma that is. 
  I particularly liked the flavored soft boil egg that was in it as well as the fish cake (I'm a sucker for that stuff). 
  I had a taste of the spicy miso broth and in comparison with mine. 
 Even though it was salty it still tasted a bit bland overall. 
 I had to drink at least 3 cups of water to get halfway through the broth. 
 The restaurant itself is small and there's often a wait for a table during lunch or dinner. 
 They also serve alcohol here (like soju) for those who need a drink with their meal. 
 someone coming over and ask you what you wanted to drink. 
 it came with when the food arrived. 
It was busy so I understand if drinks aren't always refilled. 
Like food is good and all. 
 I love the aromatic grilled meats and lunch combos . 
 parking was actually challenging during lunch time . 
The food came to our table within 5 min after we ordered. 
 I believe it was the spicy paste on top that I didn't like because the broth tasted great before the paste was mixed in. 
 It wasn't processed well and still had that pork stink taste. 
 a great place to go for comfort food especially they open late. 
FOOD: I got the Koro Ramen ($8. 
 Basic taste. 
 it just didn't compliment the taste. 
I highly recommend the chuka-soba to anyone who wants to taste the chuka-soba like the ones in Japan. 
 Server was so friendly and food was satisfying. 
 this place is good if you are craving ramen and don't want to wait too long for your food. 
 and it tasted surprisingly better without extra soy sauce. 
Overall: I would definitely come back to try out more of the food. 
 a little too salty and thick for my taste. 
  I usually drink alot of the broth . 
 We got our food rather quickly. 
 Their lunch specials pretty much gives you an extra entree on top of a bowl of ramen (. 
 it does not come with an egg though so make sure to order that separate if you're ordering lunch). 
  Broth tasted okay. 
 you have to share the lot with plenty of other food establishments. 
 the food was okay. 
  An added plus is that they are open beyond midnight making them a great alternative to late night fast food. 
 I thought the broth was a little fatty for my taste. 
 Food was fast and tasty. 
 The lunch special was perfect - soup and appetizer. 
  I thought mine tasted better though. 
 I LOVE the egg and have never tasted such a delicious egg ever before in my life. 
 great service and great food. 
It's just no other option for Japanese food at late night. 
 Everything we ordered tasted pretty authentic and I'm really picky when it comes to ramen especially their broth. 
 Only con for me was that the broth had a little pungent pork taste . 
The ramen tastes like packets of Maruchan. 
 It tasted like fried rice with just a hint of kimchi. 
 especially if you love the kimchi taste. 
 food came out in good time. 
 This is a plus for me because I'd be stricken with "food coma" after eating such meals. 
They have lunch combos you can choose from if you're extra hangry. 
 and it tasted pretty diluted. 
 it was just a bit too marinaded in soy sauce for it actually tasted more like a tea egg. 
 I don't usually like bamboo shoots unless they are very cooked and taste similar to the broth. 
 and I think there were 5 or 6 tables? Definitely there will be a wait if it's slightly packed or if it's lunch. 
dinner rush. 
 fish cake. 
 tasted like it came out of powder packaging. 
 Brought food out on time. 
Favorite is the Chanpon (seafood and veggie ramen) with side of Cha Shu pork combo. 
Food:We ordered 2 Cha ramen with 2 extra eggs and corns.
