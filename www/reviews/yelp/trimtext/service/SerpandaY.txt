 So eventually they took too long and I ask for my money back so finally the manager comes out off her lazy ass to ask wheres my receipt. 
 this location has very poor service. 
  The staff has already begun to shut down. 
 the staff does try to get your entree ready. 
The place gets very busy and under staffed so it's not kept clean. 
 The service was bad. 
  Had I been going on customer service only you would have gotten zero stars. 
 never seen one so poorly staffed and run especially at lunch time. 
I also did a kids meal which the manager frowned upon . 
  Why can't all places take this same approach to customer service?
 you get staffs that likes to skimp and give you barely enough of an entree. 
The 2nd staff  (old Chinese lady) who worked at the main section of the food line. 
Previously I asked the 1st staff if they are making a new fresh batch of mushrm. 
  After she volley me to the 2nd staff. 
If you want to gamble on service or don't mind being skimped on. 
Service was nice enough. 
 here? Friendly staff was a good start. 
 the speed of service could be improved. 
-GREAT friendly service
  Food is always reliable and service is typically exceptional and right on point. 
Biggest customer service fail ever. 
 wasn't able to give an accurate take of your customer service fail. 
 since their customer service is AMAZING.
