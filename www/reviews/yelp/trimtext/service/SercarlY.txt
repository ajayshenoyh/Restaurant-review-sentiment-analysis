I have never experienced the negative experiences with customer services others have had. 
 The service is not very good either. 
 The manager tries to appear friendly and professional . 
 what do you expect from a customer service job? Guess the entire staff puts up with it because they need the money because I can't see them doing the job for fun. 
Pros: Fast service before 11:30. 
  I can't reverse the service charge so it doesn't matter anymore. 
 worst customer service ever. 
 muttering that it didn't work until a manager (the one short lady with the unnaturally high bangs) smugly goes. 
  They always have great consistent service. 
Customer Service: 5. 
Fast service by pleasant people. 
for THIS kind of service we're supposed to support the idea of $15 per hour for fast food employees? this was a service disaster
t service from the awful girl at the window?
 the service has gotten progressively worse since the re-opening and I think I'll take the time to drive to the Rose Drive location the next time we get a Carl's craving.
