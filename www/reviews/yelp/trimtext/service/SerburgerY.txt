The service is great. 
The customer service is terrible with an employee and her boyfriend spreading mulch and then going to the counter to take your order and to handle your food. 
 also for the service. 
Clean restaurant fast service
 and yet also claim that they're going to get it fixed next week? When I asked this poor excuse for a manager. 
 she turned her back on me and serviced the drive-thru window. 
 this place has no air-conditioning even though their rude manager. 
The sandwiches were good and service was friendly at the drive thru. 
Service is slow at the drive thru. 
 it was near closing and they were really understaffed. 
  The staff treats you like their doing you a favor. 
 the manager was working and he had my food ready and i came to pick it up and checked my order for accuracy. 
 the cashier rang it up wrong i guess and the manager tarted to be rude to me and started yelling at me. 
 customer service? not good
