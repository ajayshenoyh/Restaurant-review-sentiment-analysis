Staff was great. 
I feel bad for the staff. 
 the service is ok. 
Polite staff - and they work quickly to move the line if there is one. 
 we didn't have any trouble with the employees so that's always a good thing because customer service is the most important thing to me. 
 and decent service - Ill keep this location as my "go-to" subway. 
Service is inconsistent here. 
 I feel like every time I come in (3x a week minimum) there's new staff. 
The two employees that were working at the store this evening were NOT customer service oriented and really made the entire experience awkward. 
 Usually I get great customer service from this store. 
 the service I received this evening and the lack luster quality of the sandwich has left a negative experience on my mind. 
 I have worked in the customer service and hospitality industry for 10 years and the service I received this evening really was horrendous. 
I have already sent this complaint into Subway via their customer service form: http:.
