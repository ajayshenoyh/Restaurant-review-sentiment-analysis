 I still wouldn't give this 5 stars yet because of the service. 
 Customer service was very nice and attentive. 
 I don't know if it is the ingredients or staff or both. 
 this location has managed to Mimic the killer service and quality offered at the original. 
 Their ingredients are always looking freshest and the staff are pretty baller. 
 it was a great experience and their FOH (front of house) staff was very friendly and accommodating. 
 Great service points in which she told me this tip and put oil on top so mine wouldn't burn in the oven and it came out perfect. 
The customer service could use some improvement. 
I will be coming back regardless of the customer service being mediocre. 
 the customer service brought it down to 4. 
 The staff are knowledgable about beer and will make you a good recommendation. 
SERVICE: Pieology. 
 I was very satisfied with the food with great customer service as well. 
 and their customer service is superb. 
 Bad service. 
Service was amazing I was asked by nearly everyone worker how I was doing. 
 Their customer service and friendly service is also great as well. 
 Took less then 5 min to make and staff super friendly. 
However- understaffed. 
I've read in a lot of the reviews about how great their customer service is and how they greet you right away. 
  The spot is clean and the staff is on point. 
  Thanks Guy for your suggestion on the pizza and your friendly service. 
But I really appreciate their customer service. 
The staff was great and super accommodating to my over the top toppings on my pizza. 
The service was great and the workers were super sweet. 
The service wasn't great- I got skipped in line. 
fast customer service and the quality food.
