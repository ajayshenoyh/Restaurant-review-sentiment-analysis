When all ingredients were in place I asked for the Sweet Onion sauce and for a little on each half of the sandwich. 
It's an ok place. 
 not enough for me to write off the place though. 
  I have more horror stories from this place . 
 this place is amazing. 
The real star of this place is the soda machine.
