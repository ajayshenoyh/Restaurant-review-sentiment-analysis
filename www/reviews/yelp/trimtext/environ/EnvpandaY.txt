I placed an online order at 12:45pm and was told my order would be ready at 1:00pm. 
The place gets very busy and under staffed so it's not kept clean. 
  Not a well run place. 
 this place went out of their way to make me absolutely miserable. 
This place should be avoided at all costs. 
  Reappears after 10 minutes and tells the hardest worker in the place Maria to go clean the dining area. 
  Why can't all places take this same approach to customer service?
 Today is Sunday and this place is ridiculously packed . 
 give this place a try. 
  All in all it was a successful trip to a chain fast food place. 
  I always get a sample of the walnut shrimp =) They are not stingy with the servings and the place is kept clean. 
 unless you offer me a fresh serving of Beiing Beef - what I wanted in the first place.
