<p itemprop="description">I was introduced to Jersey Mike's by one of my coworkers when we were working in the office at school. I got a regular Club Sub and had it Mike's way and it was definitely worth it. If you're a CSUF student you get a student discount, so it's definitely a nice way to save some bucks on their student meal deal. Without it, it is a tiny bit pricey compared to Subway but the deli meats are freshly sliced as it would be at your local grocery stores. 

When I've gone it's never been busy and it's walking distance from the university.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good but expensive. I love their Philly cheesesteak and also club supreme. Always fresh.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Today, I went into this Jersey Mikes to get a sandwich and was so pleasantly surprised by the crew working. They exemplify what it means to be a jersey mikes employee. Very courteous and friendly, and their slicing and sprinkling were on point.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location is right off of Chapman and it's fairly new. The service is fast and friendly and the food is fresh. You will have to park in the parking structure but the parking is free for the first 30 minutes and if you need more time get your ticket validated  for more time to park for free. I would recommend this place 2 people in the area for a nice sandwich.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm actually not sure why it took me so long to type this review. I've been coming regularly since they've opened for business. I think they are consistently outstanding in both taste and service. Also, it's always super clean and the price is fair for what you get. They are generous with their meat portion, unlike Subway, all you taste is bread. I totally will continue to come back to this location. Price is really never an issue for me as long as I get the service and quality of foods.  In addition to a clean place of course.

</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went in for big kahuna with the bf today. I've only been to JM in Buena Park on VV so this was my first time here. We got the giant to split. To my surprise they didn't put enough cheese in the sub at this location. The big kahuna I remember was really cheesy at the other location but at this place there was more meat in the proportion. This is a matter of preference though. Still yummy with tons of jalape√±o !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">- Locale Destination - 
It's on E Chapman Ave and N Commonwealth Ave in Fullerton. 

My buddy told me to try though I wasn't a mood for sandwich. He got me one, so I don't know about the location. 




- Gluttony Expedition - 
Tuna sandwich: the bread is kinda hard yet sorta filling, and keeps the sandwich solid despite of the very vinegary and very oily (too much Italian dressing) sandwich. I'm not a fan of the bread. I'm not big in any means. My hand isn't particularly small. However, as you see it on my picture, the sandwich is quite small, even for me - I was still hungry after the half. Usually I could get 2 meals out of a foot long Subway sandwich. Lots of tuna, some lettuce, red bell pepper sauce (meh), onions etc. in the sandwich. I'm happier and fuller with $3 "Bahn mi Che Cali" sandwich than this. Ok sandwich but not worth $8 for sure. 


- Conqueror's Deduction - 
When did the ordinary sandwich become $8?! The price is the sandwich only. Nothing else comes with. I don't get it. 

It's not as good as sandwiches in Huntington beach. (HB has surprisingly good amount of sandwich places). I don't go to "Subway", but this makes me think "Subway" is better than this. 

Very typical and uninspiring toppings, bland and crunchy bread, very small portion for the price, so so taste - way overpriced sandwich. 

Why did some people give this 5 stars?!
I don't know. I have no clue. 
It's Yelp. Many reviews aren't trustworthy. That's the fact. 

For this price, I expect a lot more. 
I wouldn't go back for this. 
Way overpriced, so so tiny sandwich.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Cool, dining space, ac is very cool which is great, food is great customer service OK.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really good sandwich. Got to get it Mikes way. They have great sandwich selection and quick and friendly service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am a former employee from a location in the inland empire and let's just say this beats my old location by a million! 

The manager is super welcoming, and friendly. I wasn't having the best day and his attitude and smile totally gave my day a change up.
I actually like that the owner is helping out up front, never in a million years would my former employer do that! All of the employees are working as a team and you can see that they all genuinely love their jobs. 

Thanks Jersey Mike's for a great sub & experience.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always very friendly. Sandwiches are the bomb! Two thumbs up. I always call in my order so it's ready when I get there :) that's the way to go. Plus, if you check in you get 10% off ;)
 Another Yelper said that their prices are higher than Brea. I asked the owner at the Fullerton location about this and they said that isn't true. It's the same owner at both locations.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food (5 out of 5).  Poor service (1 out of 5).  Employee asked me what I wanted to order with out looking at me (I was looking at the back of his head), so I did not know who he was talking to.  Then, he got my order wrong.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Bad service. Went in and there was only one customer in front of me. I stood in line for about 20 minutes while the employee was chatting with the customer about nonsense. 

Finally someone else came in from the back. I ordered a meatball sandwich. The back counter is where they keep the meatballs. I watched her prepare my sandwich, drop one of the meatballs on the bare counter, then slide it off the counter into my sandwich. I'm sure they clean their counters from time to time, but I highly doubt the counters are clean enough to lick. 

I love Jersey Mike's but never coming back to this location again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The employees here are so welcoming! I normally tip them because the subs are always finger licking good! I'm a regular, and there is also this young handsome man named Nick who has always perfected my subs. Oh, & always, ALWAYS get Mike's Way!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just ate here at jersey mikes for the first time and I have to say I was impressed! Everyone was very friendly and the sandwich was better than I expected since I'm not really a sandwich person. Keep up the good work :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">MIKE'S WAY IS THE ONLY WAY!! 

I've always loved olive oil + vinegar on my sammiches, and it's done right at Jersey Mike's. We used to have to travel a little farther to get our fix, but now it's right down the street from us! It's located on the ground floor of a new apartment complex on Chapman, and at least for the time being you can park in the structure without needing validation! THE GIANT IS A GIANT!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a very well run franchise, Clarissa is very nice and helpful and the whole staff was friendly. The place is super clean. Jersey Mikes has a good product and this location really does a good job at serving it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of the best Jersey Mikes I've been at. They offer good deals, and they grill your cold subs. Will definitely keep coming to this one among with family and friends.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Jersey Mike's subs are amazing! 
This Fullerton location has a very friendly, kind staff.
Jersey Mike' offers a completely different experience from Subway because you can actually see the meats and the other things you are going to put inside your sub being directly cut and cooked in front of you.
It is a little bit more expensive than Subway, but after a single bite, you will understand why.
Mike's Way, even though is a little too oily, is extremely tasty!
Their Philly Steak is awesome and also try the Chipotle version of it.
Jersey Mike's also offers discounts for students.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Jersey Mike's in HB... This location uses way too much oil/vinegar. Tell them to be careful.

The sandwiches are very pricey, so do not come here if you are on a Subway budget.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mike's way is the only way to go! It is a bit pricey, but it's nice to see the meat sliced right in front of you.

The big mess they make while making them is a bit of a turn off for me, but it won't stop me from going again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was busy doing yard work so my wife went and picked up a sandwich for me.  What was supposed to be a turkey, ham, and bacon (I think) ended up being mostly mayonnaise.  I ended up throwing the whole thing away and ate a granola bar.  Epic fail.  I posted a pic for you to see.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here after class today for a bite before work. I ordered the Jersey Mike's Famous Philly. 

When I got to the register I ordered a drink as well. My total was about $10 which I felt was very expensive.

My sandwich was given to me after the couple who ordered after me got their Philly sandwich.

When I unwrapped the foil I was presented with an extremely thin sandwhich that was mostly bread. The contents of the sandwhich was minimal and looked nothing like the sandwich in the picture which showed the top half of the bread sitting on top of the contents. 

The sandwhich itself tasted subpar. I threw it away about when I was 3/4 of the way through. I couldn't bring myself to finish eating it. 

My $10 would have been used better by supporting a local family business or going to the Fullerton Farmer's market. 

I wouldn't recommend this location to my friends or family. If you want a good sandwhich place in Fullerton visit "The Sandwhich Place" or "Tranquil Tea Lounge". You won't feel like you wasted money eating at either of those locations.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome staff and great sandwiches! My go to sand which place right now. Wish they were close to my work I'd get lunch here all the time!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always great eating at Jersey Mike's! Glad they opened one up closer to anaheim. This is a store with great service. Same owner as the one in Brea, by the mall. Been here a couple of time and never waited more than a minute to get my sandwich. Can't go wrong with any of the subs and of course you must get it "Mike's Way." Parking is behind next to the residential parking that's above the store.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! They never put too much of anything or too little. I constantly am coming back!! The reason I am giving it 3 stars however is because the last time I went their avocados tasted old and ruined. They usually always have fresh ingredients so I was very surprised when I bit into my 8 dollar sandwich and realized it was ruined. Also customer service sucks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Subs here are really good. Kind of pricy , but worth the price. Kind of like subway but a little different. Not bad<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Jersey Mike's always deserves 5 stars because it's the best sandwich out there! It doesn't get better than fresh cut meat thrown onto a sandwich. I always get the number 9 miles way and it never fails. I recommend this place to everyone! They also have student specials so if you go to CSUF make sure you ask them about it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really like this Jersey Mike's location because it is close to where I live and CSUF.  They have an amazing student discount which actually makes Jersey Mikes affordable.  I was forced to mark it down 1 star because they have messed up my order a couple times.  I must say when they do make a mistake they are nice about it, and they haven't made one in awhile, I definitely recommend this place for a great tasting sandwich!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The only assigned star goes to the employees the night I walked in. Their service was fantastic, but it can't change the fact that Jersey Mike's sandwiches are just awful. Tell you what: the bread is good. 

Sandwiches ordered: Big Kahuna and Turkey Breast and Provolone. 

Price: Don't get me started - wayyyy too high for what they are. 

Taste: Bland. The delis at Ralphs make better sandwiches. 

Overall Impression: I really wanted to like this company, but I can't justify spending any more money here. I'd drive past 15 Jersey Mike's to get to a Subway. And I HATE Subway.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm almost positive their menu prices are significantly higher than the standard, but that probably comes with being located in a college apartment building. Guess what else you'll get at this location in a college apartment? Sh*tty service from lazy, college kid workers. The counter was gross and unorganized, there was not a crowd here so I'm not sure why it took so long to make my 1 sandwich, and obviously I'm willing to drive up the street to the location on Birch because it's cheaper to pay the gas than the $2-3 upcharge here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love eating their subs! I love eating their phily cheese steaks! It's like one of the best things in life! But the only thing I don't like about jersey mikes is the long lines to order!! You know it's good if there's a long line! Heheheh!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here today October 6th at 8:25pm. I was told the grill was off and I couldn't get a hot sandwich. I was really disappointed because I love Jersey Mikes. I'm just not sure if it's store policy to shut off a grill 30 minutes before your suppose to close or if the staff was just having a bad day and couldn't wait to leave.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Why are there 5 people behind the counter? 

Girl used a wet rag from under the counter to wipe down the knife - gross. 
Then she didn't change her gloves and touched our sandwiches - so gross. 
She was chomping on her gum and blowing bubbles - YOU'RE WORKING WITH FOOD! 

2 stars because the man was really nice and I know jersey mikes subs are usually good. Really wanted to like this location cause it's close to my Bfs but I'll be sticking to PKs in Brea for my cold subs.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great new location by CSUF!  Staff is super duper friendly, parking is very accessible and it's so close to campus that Which Wich better watch out.  I love Jersey Mikes and this is my favorite location right now.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I wasn't really all that impressed. I've been to better sandwich shops. The staff is super friendly and their baked cookies are amazing. However they're called a sub place. I got a club which wasn't really all that great. I dislike Italian dressing and figured I would try it, maybe they made it different. It wasn't good. The meat and the cheese had a bit of an odd taste to it. I liked the bread though. It was soft and a little chewy how I like it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is amazing! I've been hearing great things from this place from friends and saw that this one just opened up and it's really close to my house. So I went in and ordered the classic Italian sub.  I originally planned on just getting the sub, but since it's so close to the csuf campus they have a great student discount that comes with chips and a drink at a great price! The staff was very polite and helpful, and knew how to make a mean sub haha. Will definitely be coming back here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First day visit!  Good sub as expected, grew up on this place and Poor Boy in Jersey!  Meat may have been a little lighter than I remember back in the day.  But now i have one by my house i'll be a regular!  Gotta get some Pork Roll!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered a chipotle cheesesteak wrap, and while it tasted good, it had to be the thinnest wrap I had ever gotten and I had paid $7 something for it. It contained less than half of what a burrito at chipotle would have yet more expensive. Definitely not worth coming back here if they are going to skimp on the portions.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The owner is rude to her employees and customers. Makes it uncomfortable to eat there. Don't plan on returning to this location.<p>
