<p itemprop="description">I love Panera. I also love that this one is close to home. I visit every few weeks for the apple salad. I also enjoy the cookies, but we won't talk about that... (I could eat them DAILY...by the dozens even.)

Did you know you can order in advance and pick up from their pick-up area? Order, pay, in and out. LOVE it. 

The staff here is super nice. It seems to be a popular place for the Fullerton college kids to hang out too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yeah, I won't be coming back. 

PARKING
Plenty of parking in the plaza. This location is on State College next to the KFC. It's in the same plaza area as Thai Basil and Sharetea!

INTERIOR/ EXTERIOR
Very similar layout to their other locations. Stepping in, you're greeted with beautiful displays of their delicious looking pastries up front. They have many tables to the left of the register but you might want to think again about dining in.

MENU
I've previously only taken breakfast pastries or drinks to-go and this is my first time dining in at this location. 

The friend and I came by when we  saw that our original destination was closed. We placed our order and sat down to wait for our food to come. We got the Chinese Citrus Cashew Salad and their You Pick Two option, getting their half-half Chipotle Chicken Avocado and Mac & Cheese. Quite the regret upon the arrival of our food! Instantly, I noticed that my spoon was still stained and dirty - caked with last person's mysterious meal of whatever they ate. So disgusting! Appalled at the thought once again.

The portion for the salad was generous but I would not recommend their You Pick Two option unless you are ordering for a young child. The plate looks empty and for $12, it was not worth it at all. However, the sandwich itself was not bad.

SERVICE
Service during my visit is probably the only thing that is saving this review. The guy at the register is nice. I am a little disappointed at the server because despite looking at our food as he brought it to us, he neglected to see that both utensils (spoon and fork) were still dirty. Even upon replacement, many of the utensils were dirty and I felt disgusted trying to eat without touching any part of the spoon.

Suggestion for management? Get your shit together! No one wants to eat at a dirty place and while your pastries and food selections may be good, I don't think I'd ever come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have had a rough history with Panera Bread.. dating way, way back.. ever since I was a tiny, non-food blogging, uninteresting wee one. Let me just say that salad dressing was THROWN at me by a manager once.... Yes it has been a rough past. 
I have moved on from that, however, and go to the Panera Bread at the Village in Orange almost every day just to do homework. Their Wi-fi, however, is so slow, and the wi-fi at the one in Brea kicks you off after 30 minutes, and the one in Anaheim hills doesn't even work...
Do you see how this can be frustrating for me?
Yesterday morning, I was having the WORST study/stress/homework frustration and I just couldn't deal with that stupid Wi-fi at orange anymore. So, I hopped in my car, picked up a Jamba Juice energy bowl, and headed to this Fullerton location (which, mind you, is now 25 minutes from my home...) in hopes of good Wi-fi and a bagel because I was so frustrated. Well, the stupid mobile app was not working for me, so I called the store, because if they were out of blueberry bagels, I was literally going to lose it. 
Thank the Lord that the woman who answered my call, Pearla, was the manager and so understanding of all my issues.... Long story short, when I arrived, Pearla had my bagel ready with my 2 sides of cream cheese, and even honored my mobile-app-only coupon. She also let me keep my outside food (which you are apparently not allowed??....) 
The Wi-fi worked perfectly, and Pearla really brightened my stressed, gloomy (it was raining) day. So, despite the further drive, I guess this will be my new Panera-study spot! 

Good job, Panera! Maybe you really are overall improving!

PS- I REALLY wanted a good bagel from Avalon, because, from what I remembered, Panera's bagels were no good. 
This was extremely inaccurate. That was one of the best blueberry bagels I ever had, and the entire time I debated buying a second... It was so soft and berry-filled. The wild blueberry and honey-walnut cream cheeses were heavenly, as well. This could become an addiction, Panera Bread...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sorry I've been lagging on my reviews! So this is for 9/23/16. I believe the cashier working at the time was named Donald and he went above and beyond with my order. I came to claim my free birthday reward, so I decided to get a brownie. That was very delicious by the way. I also decided to get the frozen mocha which wasn't that great, so that's off my list. I felt like Donald went above and beyond because he actually brought my drink to me while I was sitting and waiting, which was very thoughtful because most places/staff will just call your name behind the counter. So great job Donald!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OMG, so like the idiot that I am I came BACK to this Panera location. "WHY?!" you ask; well the Panera in Brea that I normally go to had run out of broccoli cheddar soup and I REALLY, REALLY, wanted it. "What happened", you say?!

- I ordered my food online, as I was going here on my lunch break and wanted to go in and out as quickly as possible.
- The online order gave an order ready time which was approximately 15 minutes.
- I showed up 3 minutes early, just in case it was already ready and I could get back to work. It wasn't ready of course.
- I waited 25 minutes. TWENTY. FIVE. MINUTES. AFTER my order was supposed to be ready. Everyone around me who was also there to pick up an online order were not getting their orders either. About 5 people asked for their money back and another 3 people went up to the front.
- I finally went up to the front and asked how much longer it would be for my order which was supposed to have been ready 25 minutes prior, and they searched for my order, printed it out, and then fulfilled the order. 
- I wasted my entire lunch at this place waiting on my order. NOPE. 

I have FINALLY learned from my mistake. I guess third times a charm.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This morning I watched Panera Bread refuse to allow a kind homeless man to sit at one of their tables... despite my offer to buy him food. "Food must be purchased by him."  They stood over him and his wheelchair. Interrupted me as I tried to ask for them to respect my wishes to let this man I know to be here. Told me this was their store not mine. These our policies of corporate and we can not refuse to follow them.
To me there is no more important values than fairness, equality, understanding, justice, community. To respect each others humanity. Rich or poor, our behavior should decide how we're treated. This type of behavior can not be over looked.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nothing special about this Panera but as far as Panera's go it's a great location.

The food is what you would expect at any other location and the layout is very similar to many other Panera locations.

Always had a decent selection of bagels available and the pastries were what you would expect.

The employees at this location are very friendly and offer samples an suggestions.

The restaurant and restrooms were always tended and there was always seating available.

Can't really give less than 5 stars. The food was what you would expect, the location is clean, well stocked, and the staff is friendly so there's no real reason not to come unless you just don't like Panera.


#86/100<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I often do tutoring here (one of us, at least, will buy food each time), and a week ago we were trying to connect to the internet for an online homework assignment, only to find out that the internet was entirely down. That's a pretty major problem for a place like Panera, which is largely used by, e.g., students doing homework and the like, but I figured, maybe it had just happened and they hadn't had time to get it fixed yet. I held off on writing a review at that point.

We came back today, and apparently the internet is still "spotty" to the point where we couldn't connect at all. This is a week later. They couldn't get someone out to fix the internet in that time? A place like Panera? That's ridiculous.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Come by for a quick lunch haven't had Panera in a long time and want something quick and healthy. Love how they have freshly baked bread and bagels. I got a half turkey avocado sandwich and a half Asain sesame salad. The half sandwich was really tiny nonetheless still good. The highlight was definitely the salad McKee chunks of chicken with a super tasty Asain dressing. Overall, great spot for a healthy lunch.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location is near Cal State Fullerton in a plaza next to Pieology.  The parking lots are marked with 90 min time limits and there are a couple of spots that are designated for Panera Bread as well.  The interior of this is pretty nice, it's spacious and there are plenty of tables as well.  I came here once to work on a project with some colleagues and the Wi-Fi was horrible.

I was trying to go for something a little more healthy and this popped up when I searched for salads.  For starters, I was attended very politely and the cashiers were very patient as well.  I went with the Chicken Soba Noodle Salad, but they also offered it with peanut sauce too.  Adding the peanut sauce was shown as a new edition to their menu and I contemplated on getting it.  In the end I choose to not get the sauce and one of the employees offered to exchange my salad for something else if I didn't like it.  I choose a french baguette to side with the salad and that was free so nice perk right there.

One thing I noticed was that I had no idea when my order was done.  I didn't hear my name called and so they could work on that.  Okay so the salad I got looked pretty good, but for $7.29 its not that filling.

Nice fancy box, there were more noodles than greens. Some bits of carrots, spinach, chicken and a whole lot of noodles.  This particular salad that I got started off good and went sour quick.  It tasted like they drenched the salad with vinegar.  By the time I was almost done I saw the spinach at the very bottom of the box practically soaked.  It left an unpleasant aftertaste...to much of that dressing.

Price- Alright
Service- Average
Food- Decent<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I wish I didn't even have to give a star to give a review. I've been to this Panera restaurant more then once. Simply because I live close to it. But every time I come I regret going. I'm always missing items on my orders. I often don't drive back and make in issue. But this time I went back to let them know that my Chicken Cesar Salad was missing the chicken. The response was I can see if can get you two free meals on another day. But for today it was to late for them to replace. 

I don't want two free meals. I want service, I want a place that cares about making things right. You would think they would make the effort to make it right, and today not tomorrow. How long can it possibly take. What am I suppose to tell the person that didn't get there meal in our group? Maybe I'm just upset, and more upset that I counted the boxes to make sure I didn't have the same issue I had in the past. But instead I got the right number of boxes, just not the correct items.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I come here once a Week primarily for the convenience. The food is ok, but not great. The desserts are averaged, not to die for. However, Service is Amazing!

I usually get their salads or Turkey Panini. For dessert, I usually get their Toffee cookies. Tried their Pecan Bun for the first time cause it looked good.  However, I was not impressed, it was really hard, I only took a bite and threw it away.  I also tried their Chicken Soup for the first time and didn't like it either. Honestly, Denny's has better Chicken noodle Soups.  If you like Brocolli Soups, I heard it's pretty good, but not my cup of tea.  Should've stuck with my usuals.

Tips: Join their Rewards Program and get rewarded accordingly. If you order a drink, you can get a dessert for $1.29 (good deal)

Price: 3/5
Cleanliness: 4/5
Quality: 3/5
Atmosphere: 5/5
Customer Service: 5/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The store was very clean the employees where very nice they kept on smiling when they were asking questions I think every other store should be like this one always smile when doing customer service. Keep it up guys I will be coming back soon!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nothing special about this location, but as it's clean, service is friendly, and food is good, it deserves four stars. 
Would recommend for a quick bite. Not too fancy, quiet, and a lot of college students hanging around to study, but that's fine.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Standing in line at 8:20 AM thinking this is busy time of the day. There's about seven people in line. One cashier trying to take everybody's order just very time-consuming coming into this location. I'm before they try to do this multiple times and it feels every time I just don't have 15 minutes to make an order that they can just pick up put in a bag and give to me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera is a go-to place when you're looking for a place to grab a bite while cranking out emails or cramming for an exam/assignment you procrastinated on. This location is close to local schools such as CSUF and Troy HS so you're bound to see students hanging out here. Food quality and taste at each location is consistent. I haven't had any problems with my food personally. However, each location is different in it's own way.

As a previous employee of Panera, I thought this location was quite lacking in service. Even I didn't treat my own customers rude.

The service was not terrible. However, every time I go to this location in comparison to the Costa Mesa or Huntington Beach/Westminster location, none of the workers seem friendly.  Even if I had a bad day or didn't feel like being there, at least I faked a smile to make someone else's day. Tables are not cleared and wiped clean that I do it myself. I don't normally come during rush hours so I don't get why it's not kept to expectations. Also, the managers need to be friendlier at the registers (you can spot them in black/maroon dress shirts.) They just wanna take your order and shoo you away instantly. They're even worse at customer service than their associates.

Breakfast recommendation: asiago bacon egg and cheese. If you like a kick, swap out the asiago bagel for a jalapeno cheddar bagel.

Salad recommendation: BBQ chicken salad

Soup recommendation: summer corn chowder (only from June-August though :( )<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When I think of this location the words gastrointestinal distress come to mind. 

Was here on a Friday night and ordered a sandwich and a bowl of mac and cheese. My mac and cheese was luke warm around the outside and cold in the middle. I notified one of the bus boys in the dining area and he pointed out that there was a microwave near by that I could use to re-heat it and that they couldn't take the mac and cheese back to the kitchen. He then offered to walk the bowl of mac and cheese to the microwave and reheat it for me, but he really should've made me a new one. Shortly after we left I had sharp pains in my stomach, etc.
     The place was disheveled and the staff were all college kids standing around talking in a group of 4 with their regular clothes on and one of them wearing their back pack. A solicitor came in with a sign that said any donation helps and would go to each table and bother patrons. The bus boy called over his supervisor to make him leave and when she arrived it was a joke. She was wearing a flannel and jeans and telling the solicitor he's not allowed to do this and she was going to escort him outside. One of the patrons in the dining room gave him her French baguette.

     I would avoid this Panera location like the Plague because you'll get the Plague since they don't cook their food at the proper temperature, offer to make the situation right and cause gastrointestinal distress.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love it here. Everyone is super friendly and my order is given to me right away. I never have too wait then 5 min. The cashiers are very knowledgeable on all there foods.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here several times and have never been disappointed. Well trained and professional staff that seem to bring a smile to your face each time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a wonderful location and they have a wonderful staff! Super friendly! Food got to our table nice and fast! Our waitress was named Amy and she was amazing, fast and sweet! Personable and accommodating. Highly recommend this Panera!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Summary: do not get the Mac and Cheese. They will give you a fifth of what you pay for.
Usually I'm a fan of Panera. But this time I was so incredibly disappointed. I came here with my boyfriend for dinner. Every time we come he gets a "you pick 2" with the Mac and Cheese. 
Since he gets the same thing every time, we know what the portion size like like. When they brought us our food everything was in order, but there was about 4 views of Mac and Cheese in his bowl. Usually it is filled just under the line on the bowl. This was no where near what you should pay $5 for. 
We talked to the employees about it but they denied it being a smaller portion than usual. 
One employee have us a free pastry, but I'm sad to say that can't compensate the 75 cent with of Mac and Cheese that we paid $5 for.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I when to this location 2 weeks ago to order a french onion soup about 9 am. And the girl told me that the soups weren't ready yet! Really at 9 am? Well today I  went again about 10 am to get the same soup and the Mediterranean egg white sandwich and the guy told me that they didn't have the pesto sauce, really? I said, he replied saying that the sauce was still frozen( being this sandwich on the breakfast menu) which they serve until 10:30, this management is a joke! Probably I'll come back to panera bread because I love it but not this location!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been to this location a few times for pick-up orders.  The food has always been fresh and delicious, but the customer service and store cleanliness is a bit lacking compared to other Panera locations.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the worst Panera bread I ever went to.  I usually love the place.  

The sandwiches were thrown together.  No bread bowls for soup. No ice for drinks. Employees don't seem to care. It was dirty.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my only time to this Panera and compared to other Paneras I was disappointed. Service was really slow and they were out of a lot of food staples (spinach, kale, others). I ordered the roasted turkey bacon BLT, which I love from other Paneras; it didn't have any condiments on it and was really dry and the turkey was just a ball in the middle of the bread, making it difficult to eat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just want to recognize the cashier with the plugs. Don't know his name, but he rocks! Actually, everybody at this location is pretty great and I would drive farther to go to this particular location because the service is as good as the food! Love Panera Bread!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I dread this place and do my best to avoid it. It's really too bad because it is super convenient to my  home and work. I have been there a number of times due to giftcards and location . I always regret going. Seriously, I have never left feeling like it was even a decent experience. I've put off writing this review because I kept hoping things would change, but no. 

List of offenses:

1. Long waits...one person ahead of me and the cashier struggles consistently...I just want a coffee. Usually the struggle is explaining why they don't have "X" item.

2. Constantly out of menu items...pastries, soups, and even bevarages

3. Failure to complete online order. just simply didn't put it out for rapid pick-up...again and again

4. Wrong items and missing items. Oh you didn't want chicken on your salad...let me just pick it off for you...That was real a response I got once. Gross.

5. Dirty tables...everywhere...again gross!

6. Cold things that should be warm and warm things steaming....soup-cold-very cold- sandwich steaming hot...what???<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've done rapid pickup here a bunch of times and they've lost or not received my order on at least five occasions. This last time the associate couldn't be more disinterested in solving my problem. I told him I was in a hurry (hence the rapid pickup) and in response he seemingly took longer preparing my bagel and breakfast sandwich. I love Panera so I'll keep coming back, but this isn't my favorite location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is amazing for anything sandwich bread related. I've always been a fan of Corner Bakery over Panera but that's all changed ever since I've tried their whole menu!

Not only does Panera excel at salads and made-in-house dressings, but their paninis ROCK, as in they're awesome, and their baked desserts are almost magical. I'm not much of a sweet tooth so I really enjoy their lightly fresh-baked cookies and breads.

Service here is usually great and friendly, I enjoy being a customer here and support their cleanly cafe-type ambiance. 

The food is great, service is good, and you can feel free to spend some extra time here. They won't mind :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Have been giving this place more chances but each time it's bad. I order to go and they always forget something or have it cold<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time at a PANERA and our cashier Dana was so helpful on what to order. She was familiar with the menu and we enjoyed everything she recommended. This place  was so clean and comfortable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Panera rocks. I find myself in the area about once a month and it always seems to be a fun and fast experience. Of especial note is a young lady named Hunter. Great attitude and sweet. Hunter rocks! Will be back every time I'm in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's funny.  Ive never been all about Panera.  That changed today.  First time at this location.  My friend and I sat outside most of the day studying- like 7hrs.  She bought a meal while I just got some iced coffee.  We walked in and out refilling our drinks throughout the day.  
We were greated with big, genuine smiles when we walked in and that friendly attitude stayed the whole day.  
Honestly (and this is the sad part), I had a hard time accepting that people were so nice.  I live in costa mesa and I guess I've gotten used to ppl being somewhere btwn indifferent and mildly rude.  This kindness took me by surprise.   What confirmed the genuineness for me was Chris (manager? If not, should be..) who went put of his way to check on me and my friend and to make us feel welcomed.

Great experience.    While I can't say I'll be enthusiastic about other Paneras, I do know that I'll gladly return to this location.  (Probably this Monday when we meet up to study again lol)

Great work Fullerton Panera team!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As a first timer I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the kitchen and eating area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place was great it was a little busy when we first got in but we got our food fast and fresh. I ordered the chicken noodle soup and turkey BLT with avocado they were both delicious. They were nice. After I discovered that cinnamon crunch  I was hooked . I've been looking for something like this on my life. Definitely coming back =.]<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've eaten have a few times and always found the food to be great.  The employees are friendly and helpful<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food and service were fine, but the bathroom was a mess. Not that hard to keep a restroom clean Panera!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for a quick bite. First of all, abagail took my order and she was super rude.  Rushed me and gave me attitude when I couldnt understand her because she was talking so fast.. on top of that I ordered steak and arugula panini that was cold as ice. That panini was far from cooked. They literally pulled it out from the fridge and smacked it together. DISGUSTING!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I LOVE panera. Decided to stop by an get dinner. Placed an orde they had no Clam chowder soup. Placed and order on something else there was no ice and the sodas was super flat. Decided to throw that and get lemonade. No lemonade. Had to settle with a warm ice tea. Got no spoon for my soup. When asked if there was anything else I needed told the guy a spoon would be good. Tables are not that clean. When I came in  it was really empty. Worst Panera I been to<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like the fact that the nutritional values are easy to find.  Convenient and relatively fast.  Have done the order online and pickup option which was convenient but my order was wrong.  The manager said to tell him the next time I came so I could get a credit for this but I still haven't done it.  
Prices are reasonable, food tasty.  My daughter got stomach issues after eating a tuna salad sandwich there, I don't know if it was the tuna, but suspicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If I could give a a zero I would from service to food! Planets is normally a good choice. I shutter tot hi k someone want's $15.00
An hour.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Close to CSUF and is a good study location, however, the music playing is a weird selection. I wish I brought my headphones. In regards to the food, I got Mac and cheese, but it was cold. :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The worst place I've ever went to eat hands down. The girl taking my order was very rude and not helpful and the food tasted bland and terrible. My 10 dollar brother bowl came half full without any of the ingredients that they said were in it. Over priced and terrible food with really bad service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I normally like Panera but I had the absolute worst experience this time and will not be back. The girl working the register, Abby, had the worst attitude, extremely rude. She would go on her phone while we were trying to order and talking to her friends in line behind us and seemed annoyed when we were asking her about items on the menu. 
Then when we got our food I ordered the lentil quinoa broth bowl it was only 1/4th of the way full and did not have quinoa or lentils instead had brown rice but no one let us know. Definitely lost my business.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love panera bread and come here often, but my visit today was disheartening b/c of the blonde cashier girl named Taylor. She didn't at all look me in the eye even once, say hello, or even smile at me. She looked as though she hated her job and that I was wasting her time by ordering my food. I tried to smile at her but her face was literally stone faced. She handed my my receipt and already was rushing me away....I don't like to be treated as though I'm a nuisance and this experience really killed my appetite. Always be friendly and at least look as though you don't hate the place<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I come here from time to time before church service and so far so good! I'm all about customer service, and the cashiers (Jacquelin and Daniel) are always super nice. Honestly the food is a bit pricy BUT worth it. Occasionally you get rewards and the food is pretty good quality so I don't mind the price. If you're looking for something to just fill your stomach at a low price, there's always McDonald's (and their meat is questionable lol) I tend to lean on their med or thai flat bread which is bomb. So is their green tea and orange cram muffin! Smoothies and salads here are good for diets hehe, thanks Panera!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have nothing against Panera Bread in general, but this panera doesn't have the greatest service. It seems as though the cashiers and servers don't like their jobs at all, and don't try to hide that (which can be uncomfortable).

The food however, is still good. I really like their Mac and cheese but I hate that it's +$5 for a tiny bowl.

Overall, good food, sometimes unreasonably expensive, with subpar service (at least this location).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The worst service! I waited 15+ minutes for a bowl of soup which I ordered because I was in a hurry only to watch people who arrived after me get their food. In addition , the cashier had to enter my account number 5 times before she got it right. I meet clients at this location and we always seem to experience such issues and for toppers the Internet is limited to 30 minutes whether you use it or not. Not a user friendly place to eat or work.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in today for the 1st time for breakfast and ordered the asiago breakfast sandwich and they don't have Asiago bread, so i ask for it on a jalapeño bagel, they also do not have that, mind you it is 10am. Then I proceed to pay and give the cashier a $100 bill, she says "I'm sorry but we do not accept bills larger than $50" (no where posted does it say this). So I run my card grab my coffee cup and then pour myself coffee and reach for the creamer and low and behold it's empty. Go figure. I can honestly say I am never coming to this location again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Poor service, not the cleanest, and like other Panera Bread locations you get low tier, bland food in the smallest portions, and for no less than $9. Most people seem to come for the space, AC and WIFI.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Placed order online. Order was ready when promised. There was a small mixup with my order but they immediately corrected the problem and added a free item. Best of all, they did all this with a huge apologetic smile.  This is the Panera restaurant to go to.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera does not sell a franchise in single-store units; you can't own just 1 of them. To enter the Panera franchise bonanza, one must purchase a "market area" (probably more than 1 strip mall), the owner group has to be well capitalized with high net worth ($7.5MM and $3MM liquid), and already successful in real estate and multi-unit restaurant operations. Jeesh that leaves out a lot of knucklehead owners.  Doubt we will see "Panara Rescue" on Spike TV.  

Panera's brand is characterized by so many things - colors, quality, and the glorious smell when you walk in.  Reminds me of Hershey, PA.  Blindfolded you could guess you're in a Panera.  

In this location, 3 staff members busy handing inventory sprang to their registers the moment 3 customers approached the counter. Ah, training!  Smile... greet the customer...be quick lest the bread go stale while you look for the right button.  All good. And the breakfast sandwiches are good, too. 

And I love to see the CSUF students filling up the place, busy practicing their craft. Adorable.  Oh, and about the 30 minute cap on internet -- be glad you can sit it a manicured palace with $3 muffins and that's the worse to complain about.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The main menu looks good at the surface but, once an item materializes it is mediocre at best.  The ambiance is the same or slightly lower than a chain coffee shop so one is eager to get in an out as soon as possible.  The service is clumsy and slow with more focus on being "perky" than being efficient but friendly.  The baked goods are pretty good.  I wouldn't return for a meal since there are better options a reasonable distance away.  They appear to be complacent due to strong patronage by students or others associated with CSUF.  I'd consider purchasing baked goods from counter to go if I was in the area but overall not a good value.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Regarding the food, I love Panera. I haven't had any problems. All the Panera locations seem to have the same taste & quality. I would rate this Panera location average because of it's service & parking situations. 

The service was not terrible. However, every time I go to this location in comparison to the location on Rosecrans, none of the workers seem friendly. I would say a large sum of them reflect that they do not enjoy their job. In addition, their Rapid Pick Up Order system fails. I was doing a pickup & I was going to pay on the counter & they were unable to find my order in the computer. After that was settled, they were wondering where my physical order was placed. It was just very disorganized. 

Lastly, the parking with 5 Mins for Rapid Pick Up, 60 Mins Parking, & Non-Labeled Parking is such a hassle. I understand that CSUF students may be trying to park at Panera but there is already an enormous amount of signs for CSUF Parking on top of these timed choices. 

This location is close to CSUF, Troy, Fullerton College & many other schools so I wouldn't deny the convenience of it's location but there are room for improvements.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a nice, good, clean location. Dining and bathroom are very clean. They make great food and pastries. me andy GF usually order: steak and egg sandwich, french onion soup, panini (i forget if thats the word... It means "now tie pasta") Alfredo *No Chicken* (their chicken is the only thing i don't like there... Its dry and plain.), 2 cinnamon rolls and 2 large drinks.
And its an amazing meal, thats why they get 4-stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I always really want to like Panera - but I simply cannot give them a good review when their kids meals are so ridiculous.  The grilled cheese sandwich is minuscule and the portion of the Mac n cheese fills only half of the small cup it's served in.  My kids are ALWAYS still hungry after we eat at Panera and I need to remember this and never go here.  I like some of their soups and sandwiches, but with the lacking portions of the kids meals it's not worth the money to eat here.  It's not just this location but all of them, apparently.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I originally wasn't a fan of this Panera location. I've ordered pick up a couple times and they would forget my salad dressing, and once I found a piece of plastic in my mac'n'cheese. I took it up with their district manager and she treated me very nicely and help resolved the problem.
Ever since I've only had good experiences with the location. I ordered pick up and they were out of the cookie I wanted so I picked another cookie and they added an extra cookie in there for me. 
Another time I wanted a while for a cashier to figure something out on the register and she gave me a free drink while I waited. Customer service there is great and I haven't had any issues with my food at all. 

A+ for improvement!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is ok. I can make the same thing tho lol.prices are reasonable and service is reasonable. Average. I wouldn't mind coming here again if a friend or somebody invited me here, but I will not come here on my own.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just another average Panera... I come here every once in a while when I'm at school and want to grab lunch off campus. The cashiers are friendly and the food is always good! And it's never really crowded so I'm always able to find a seat. 

I usually get the "You Pick Two" combo with a sandwich and salad. Their signature salads are amazing! And their sandwiches are pretty bomb too. I love how the servers make sure that you're enjoying your meal and even offer to get you water!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like this panera! It is right next to my school so I go there to grab lunch or dinner before class. It's quick and tasty. They also have free wifi and outlets next to some of the tables so I can plug my laptop in and get some homework done while I eat. 

I love the broccoli cheddar soup. I almost always order it with a half sandwich or a salad. The salad I like the most was the Asian sesame salad; it had a nice flavor and wasn't drowned in dressing. The bread I order on the side with my soup is delicious; it super soft and tastes really fresh. The food also comes out pretty quickly which is always a plus. 

Panera is a little on the expensive side though. Just a salad with a cup of soup and a small drink was just over $15 bucks, which is a little high in my opinion when it's not really a sit down dinner kind of place. You can sit and eat there obviously but you don't have a server and you get your own drinks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The service was not very well. There was a kid at the register that had no idea what he was talking about. It was my first time to Panera and I asked what the best soup was and claimed he didn't know because he doesn't eat soup. When I received my food (chicken tortellini Alfredo) the chicken was pink and it tasted like bacon. I was not able to eat it. Spending almost $10 on a small bowl of pasta you would think they'd make sure the chicken was well cooked.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has become a hit-or-miss type of place to me, unfortunately.

The last few times I've gone to this Panera Bread have been negative experiences though.

I ordered a smoothie from them one morning, and since I'm part of their rewards program, I got an offer for a free smoothie, so I figured "Why not try it out then!" I'm a big fan of smoothies by the way, but what this Panera Bread had to offer was terrible. It was very clear that they used some sort of powder to mix this drink together, especially considering that after each sip I took, I could feel the texture of the leftover powder on my tongue and the roof of my mouth. There was this weird chemical-like taste from the powder as well. Absolutely disgusting. I'm so glad I got that smoothie for free. Not sure if all their other smoothies are like that as well, but I guess it's safe to just stay away from ordering any of their smoothies.

Their hot chocolate tends to be hit-or-miss. It used to taste great when I first started getting them from Panera, but the last few times have been a bit bland... almost like water with SLIGHT chocolate flavor. Quite disappointing. I end up getting my hot chocolate from Starbucks now for a slightly more pricey cost, but it's still worth every penny.

I haven't had many of their pastries just yet. I used to get their croissants in the past though, but I just stopped because I started realizing how greasy they were. With each bite, oil or grease would fill my mouth. Quite nasty. They would taste rather old as well - the croissant.

The last time I went to Panera (last month), I ordered their iced green tea, and it was like drinking syrup... maybe even Kool-Aid. It tasted good, of course, but I was still hoping for the green tea taste as well.

I guess at this point, this place isn't hit-or-miss at all for me for the past few months. Their food and drinks are awful. I've never tried their sandwiches before though, but having gone this far with their services, I probably won't even try their sandwiches.

Kind of regret putting quite a bit of money into this place now..

What gets a thumbs up from me, though, is the staff. I've come across nothing but friendly employees at this place. There's this one girl who works there who often looks rather pissed at the customers though, but other than that, most everyone there are very sweet.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food and service was excellent one week ago but obviously what a difference a week makes! My complaints:
*Vacant tables were not bussed or cleaned. 
*Tons of Cal State Fullerton students with Pieology boxes, Burger King bags and Chipotle wrappers sitting in the nicest seats or bigger tables. Not even patrons of Panera. WTH?
*No soap in the women's restroom
*Dirty sinks in the women's restroom
*Floors in main room needed to be mopped.
*Our order of a chicken caesar salad was missing chicken.
*There were plenty of staff standing around texting or chit chatting 

Corporate needs to hire a seasoned Manager older than 35 to manage this site. The chirpy Manager seemed more concerned with being everyone's friend and being positive than adhering to the healthcode standards or cleanliness or managing staff. Won't be back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Today was my first time ever trying Panera Bread. I have to say, I was VERY disappointed in it. I ordered the Chicken Tortellini Alfredo and it tasted like frozen tortellini's, Alfredo sauce out of a jar, topped with chicken out of a can (like tuna). The "smoked, pulled chicken" had to of been PULLED from a can and had the same look and textured as such. The side bread was so hard it couldn't even be cut with a knife. If this it the quality of their food I will NOT be going back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Inexpensive pastries all day, good soup, good iced tea, free wifi, and clean dinning area, sold. I love this place obviously. I bump into a lot of friends here too, so I know it's not just me. 

The chicken soup is my favorite, with an apple and iced tea. I get hungry again about three hours later. If timed just right, I eat dinner about five hours later, this gives me the two hours of hunger I need to maintain a decent shape. If timed incorrectly, I tend to get hangry. Watchout!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">To say the least, I went back.

I decided that since they were so close by, I'd give them another couple of shots lol.  The food remains pretty much the same, though they seemed to have fixed the whole cold soup issue I had with them.  Their creamy tomato soup is delish.

Service remains hit or miss.  Sometimes I get stuck with a cashier that has a constipated, pissy look on her face, and I know I'm going to have to beg the heavens above for patience.  I order, I'm done with her and then hope I never have to order from her again.

Then there are the girls that cashier and have painted smiles on their frowny faces.  Sad, but tolerable, and I smile brightly at them as I place my order.  This is the service that I get most of the time.

Once in a great while, the deities smile upon me and make the experience a pleasant one by providing a cashier who actually does give a fack about her impact on the customer service issue.

I still like the twofer deal with half a sammich and a cup of soup for around $8 and you can currently add a pastry for $1 if you want, to your order.

I'll keep coming back as long as I live in the area and it's a 5 minute walk for me ;)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Panera. I go every Wednesday on my lunch break. I always get taken care of! Today I had an order "swap" so I called to say the situation. The manager Chris was AMAZING. He took care of me and my swap. He was so nice and helpful. Working in the service industry I know mistakes happen and he handled it the way it was supposed to be handled. I definitely will keep coming back because the manager team is amazing there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm starting to really not like Panera bread. A few years ago I use to be all about this place and rave about how great this place is. Now I feel like they really have no idea how to make customers wanting to return back. 

This location specifically has a 30 min parking limit right in front of the parking spaces. So if you would like to stay past 30 minutes I guess you would have to move your car again. 

When you walk inside you get greeted with people taking your order and placing it. Once you order they will give you a number to put on your table. Well my food came out before I even was able to get my drink. I ordered a iced coffee doesn't sound to bad to do. They just have to give me a cup of ice and I fill it with the coffee.

Well the coffee container was empty and they said it would only take a few minutes. It took so long that my food came out and the server was trying to find me. But of course I was just waiting, and waiting. 

I don't think I will be back to this one. Most places will notice when the coffee is out and be able to fill it up fast...Come on!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really love the variety of food at Panera when I'm craving a healthy meal. Unfortunately, as the reviews have it, the service here sucks. 
My friend waited about 20 minutes for her food and I waited with her to be polite. Turns out they "lost her ticket." HOW DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN! 
And before that, when we were ordering our "You Pick 2" items, Anthony (the manager) didn't even give me a choice between bread or chips. 
THIS IS HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT. Did you guys purposely discriminate because we were college kids? Or because we were Asian? Because the other Caucasian people in the restaurant had a splendid experience.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I normally enjoy the slightly higher-priced lunch fare at Panera Bread, but this location seems to love getting my order wrong.  I work incredibly close, so I have come here on many occasions ordering incredibly simple things, but it seems to come out wrong half of the time.

One week in particular troubled me.

Monday: Ordered a Veggie Soup and Greek Salad. Greek Salad came out with chicken (which is an upcharge).  Slightly annoyed since I didn't order with chicken, but ate it anyways.

Tuesday: Ordered a Greek Salad, specified no chicken. The girl at the counter let me know it doesn't come with chicken so I don't have to specify it.  Hmm. Okay, maybe it was a one time screw up.

Wednesday: Ordered a Veggie Soup and Caesar Salad.  Salad comes out with chicken. Where is the girl from yesterday?  Apparently she's the expert on salads and chicken. Maybe she can help me.

Thursday: Ordered a Tomato Soup and Side Salad.  Look at my receipt... it has a Tomato Soup and a Corn Chowder.  Point out error to cashier, she says she'll correct it... food comes out and it's Corn Chowder.  Just Corn Chowder. I'm confused.

Friday: I go somewhere else because the line during the lunch rush isn't worth having to wait for them to fix my order.

For reals, guys. Soup and salad. I just want my soup and salad. Sigh.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can't believe the manager asked my daughter to move from the booth she was studying in-CSUF student, because she was alone and they "save booths for big parties" this is not hostess seating. First come first serve and she was a paying customer to one of the most overpriced sandwich shops out there. She left. Now boycotting Panera so rude<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Second Panera in the past week where they have covered over since of the outlets and where the internet is not working the way out used to - what message are sending to their customers?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Panera Bread is right beside my school, so during lunch or Finals, it gets really crowded. You practically have no place to sit. I usually don't eat their sandwich and salad combo because I never had the time to sit in Panera. I tried it once a few months back during Finals week. It took me about 10 minutes to grab a table. I tried one of their panini sandwiches, I already forgot which one it was. I thought that was decent, a bit salty, but decent and crispy. I was just disappointed by the salad I ordered, which I remember was their Cesar salad. Their croutons were really stale and the salad wasn't too tasty.

The only thing I'd probably recommend from here is their bread. I always buy their Asiago loaf. It's one of my favorites. I'll never get sick of it. Their pastries are pretty good too. I'm a fan of their turnovers.

Overall, I prefer their bread loaves over their actual food, but that's just this location. I have yet to try out their other locations, so I wouldn't really know!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I swear I just read a review on here about an Asian college student feeling offended because they didint get asked for chips or a baguette and the "white people" we're happy.   Uhm they have done that to me too.  Really if that's your perception on life crawl in a hole and die.  It's healthy fast food and it's good. If the end of your world is when someone didn't ask you if you wanted bread or chips then yah don't go here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Classic Salad....
it was a salad, and it was just okay. 
Balsamic reduced fat dressing was good.
Ask for allergen menu, if needed. The manager was a little hasty. Here's how our conversation went:

Me: "Do you have an allergen menu I could look at?"
Him: "What can't you eat?"
Me: "Gluten, dairy.. -"
- I was interrupted - 
Him: "We don't have anything without gluten. Sorry" 
He was so dismissive!!! sheesh...
Me: "Even your salads?"
Him: "Oh" - realizing his mistake- "it depends on the salad"
Well....duh. So he finally gave up an allergen menu and I had a few options that I could pick from. 
Salad was just okay so 3 stars, but minus 1 more for the manager's sauciness.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food here is always pretty good. I usually get the broccoli cheddar soup, and thai chicken salad and both are flavorful and taste fresh.

I'm writing a review today based on service here. On Saturdays, I so the rapid pick up and order online. When I picked up the food today, I really don't expect to interact with employees since I'm going in and out.
Today, however, on my way out, a tall gentleman working and cleaning outside stopped as I stepped out and greeted me, "have a nice day, sir." 

That's awesome excellent service. A small greeting goes a long way, and rest assured I'm going to be a frequent customer here. 

I picked up my food today at 12:30pm, so whichever tall gentleman was working and cleaning outdoors at that time, give that man a raise! Haha<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera's food is always a bit disappointing.  I am personally more of a Corner Bakery kind of person.  However, this particular location has good, friendly service.  There are plenty of seating, but the main dining area is a bit crowded and the tables always seem to be a bit all over the place... not very tidy.
Would I go again?  Probably, for a quick afternoon coffee and pastry break with the family.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I only come here if I need to get work done. The prices are high to compensate the real estate that people take up when camping out and doing work. The food is fresh and decent, not spectacular. They have good specials sometimes if you are a reward member.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location is notorious for missing numerous items from the order, whether placed online or in person. I love the food, but the order accuracy is horrible.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So Kristina O's review brings home a point about this location.  It's near CSUF so it's always going to be packed with people who are studying or tutoring.  Also, during peak hours they cap internet access at 30 minutes.  

While I can say I understand - I can also tell Panera that you are alienating people who can easily cross the street to a Bux where their time is not metered.

Best thing about this location (other than the usual rah-rah I would add about Panera's food/drink) is it's huge and the staff don't bother you if you're there for hours working on a project.  Which is great ;-)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We stopped here because we were hungry and we were in Fullerton. I'm not a big fan of Panera Bread but we couldn't find anything better. The food is not that good but the customer service at this location was really amazing. They answered all the questions I asked and were really helpful. Also everything was very clean.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went to panera in the morning thinking the bagels would be fresh since you know it's the morning...instead they tasted soooo old and my blueberry bagel even had green spots on it that looked like mold. I didn't even want to chance it because I'm pregnant. Customer service is also horrible! When I was ordering he didn't even say hi and he was talking to someone while I was ordering and I was just hoping he got everything. And he was the manager! Not coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in at 2:43 pm and was treated horribly by some girl named Nicole. Idk if it's because I am not caucasian or because I was asking a couple of questions. That is your job girl so get over it. If someone is being polite to you, you should treat them with respect and good customer service. I don't think anyone likes being scoffed at or having eyes rolled at them. (Maybe it was that time of month for her, who knows...but there's no excuse.) All soft drinks are out of order and the manager didn't even offer a refund or comp. Never coming back to this location again. I'm not helping you receive a check for the type of service you're giving.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a kind of public tutoring place that people come to study here.For example i am taking Japanese class.
Sometimes group members of the big tables can make a lot noise. 
I have no idea about their food or products they sell. Only thing that i order from there is strawberry smoothy . Trust me it is gonna relax when you study there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wish I could rate this a zero.  
-Had to clean my own table
-No ports to connect computer
-Internet logged me off after 30 minutes and I lost all my progress. (The employee I asked couldn't care less).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thank Panera for this location. Surviving four years at CSUF would not have been possible without Tuesday lunch at Panera. I had come here so much in my four years, the employees knew my order. Now, this place isn't small but you'll find yourself having a hard time finding a seat because there's so much CSUF students on top of business people here during lunch hours. But they're pretty quick and efficient. They clear tables and wipe them down as well as serve you your food almost too soon sometimes. 

Good soup, sandwiches, and salad. If you come as frequently as I do, make sure you get the rewards cards to collect points and get yourself a free pastry or drink. Friendly workers, Lots of parking space, if not in the front, plenty in the back. Walkable from the CSUF campus. Great spot for studying between classes and/or a quick and kind-of-cheap lunch. They got a soda fountain so you can sit here for the whole day refilling your soda! Just saying.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this Panera, but I'm taking off one star because of how difficult it is to get a booth here. You see booths with one person in them, and when you're with a group of four, it's rather frustrating.

The food is great, granted, it might be a little bit on the overpriced side. I love their pumpkin spice lattes in the fall, red velvet cookies, and most of their various other baked goods. Otherwise, I usually just stick to a you pick 2 with a caesar salad and a sierra turkey sandwich.

Be forewarned though! I once came here with my fiancee, and he ordered a Mediterranean veggie sandwich, and it was pretty much just bread with a little bit of veggies.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We stopped in at 9:00 for a light snack.  This location is near UC Fullerton so the parking lot was full of signs warning of no student parking and restricting parking to 30 or 60 minutes.

We ordered a refillable soft drink and a muffin to share.  The muffin was as good as at any other Panera, which isn't a bad thing.  Might have considered eating a meal but everything seemed pricey compared to other restaurants nearby.

Stayed just about an hour then figured we should leave due to the parking signs.  The wifi was very fast compared to most of the Paneras I've been to and there were lots and lots of seats.  Probably due to the parking restrictions.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Twice in a row they have gotten my online Rapid Pick Up order wrong. The first time I didn't check my bag until I got back to work only to find my order incorrect and I called to let them know. This 2nd time I ordered a Power Chicken Hummus Bowl only to have a bowl of soup in my bag. This 2nd time I went back in to tell them and show them the error. I was not impressed with just a "sorry". For this happening twice now I would have thought I would get a little more than that. Not that I would have taken them up on an offer of something but it would have been nice to know they are trying to make the customer happy. There definitely needs to be improvements on this "Rapid Delivery Service" when it always ends up not being the right order which makes this service not so "rapid". I won't be coming back to this location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's fresh and I like that, but its a bit pricey. What has been killing me is that I'm getting very different experiences here depending on if I get their food for dine in or to go. Dine in has been fairly good and no real compliant. Yet the two times we have visited recently our to go orders are below standard, less care seems to be taken, and overall quality is lacking. Done with dine out service from here, I like Panera Bread, just need better from them...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Well, they have good iced tea! But it took several tries for them to get our orders right.  My friend's bacon and sausage sandwich was missing the sausage.  My Asiago Bacon Egg and Cheese bagel came on regular bread instead of the Asiago bagel. When we finally received the correct food it was good, but it doesn't seem like it should be that hard to get what you ordered.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Panera generally has awful customer service but this location takes the cake. Slow service. Rude staff. And on top of that they constantly bring the wrong food to the wrong tables. Highly recommend avoiding this location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everyone raves up and down about how delicious Panera is, so I figured I'd give it a try.
Came during lunch and ordered for my brother and mom, we got:
* chicken tortellini Alfredo- the chicken was shredded and looked almost like tuna salad. My brother didn't like it, and he eats  anything! That's when I know a place is lacking. 
*Smokehouse turkey panini- my mom got the smokehouse. The bread wasn't crunchy enough to be called a panini. There was an overwhelming amount of some tangy barbecue tasting sauce that drenched through the already squishy bread. 
*Frontega chicken panini with a side of Caesar salad- I did the pick 2 combo. The side salad was so small and they didn't even fill the box up, how expensive is it to add some more lettuce into a box that fits in the palm of my hand? My panini had grill marks on it, but wasn't crunchy at all. Either they're making the sandwiches and leaving them out to sit, or they don't know how to use a panini press. The Frontega also had too much of a creamy sauce that overpowered my tomatoes and chicken, I felt like I was eating a mayonnaise sandwich, gross.

Ultimately the food here isn't quality and their panini's aren't even crunchy, their portions don't level with their prices. I'd rather drive 10minuted down the street to have corner bakery in downtown brea.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Who doesn't love an occasional sandwich and soup? I'm a huge fan of bread and I have to say their bread is bomb! It's soft and flavorful. I love dipping the baguette side bread into their tomato soup! The Italian Combo had a little more meat than I wanted but it was still good. 

By the way, Panera has the best chai tea! It's always a must for me. Perfectly sweet and milky. Great hot or cold!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">the service was horrible. it took about 10 minutes to get a cashier to take our order and another 15 minutes to get our order. and all we got was 2 smoothies. i was offended when someone else got their smoothie earlier than us when we made the order way earlier.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent service and the employees are very friendly, courteous, and helpful. Good area in Fullerton as far as your shopping needs are concerned too while your enjoying your dining here in this establishment.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Panera.. I do.  I just don't like this location.  There is one worker that is so intense when she helps people that she scares me, and there isn't much open seating because tons of students from CSUF and FJC come here and take up space... not eating.  

Since this website is all about the review of FOOD... let me get right down to it.

Breadbowls are my favorite.  Their bread is fresh and delicious, and the perfect combination with their soups.  My fall back soup is the chicken noodle - but my all-time favorite is the Cream of Chicken and Wild Rice.  It has this amazing flavor that goes beautifully with the bread... and leaves me wanting more.  They only have that soup on Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday, so all the other days I will get the Chicken Noodle.  The Turkey Bravo is also a good sandwich, but when I come here, I come for the soup.  It is a good price for all the bread you get, and it truly is delicious - especially on a cold day.  

The Cerritos location has the electronic GPS table locater, and I think this location needs to pick up on that... but the service is fairly prompt.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Remember that game called "Duck Hunt" by Nintendo from the 80's? Well, at this Panera, you can play something almost as fun called "Plug Hunt". You basically order your food then circle the area searching for an outlet. Most likely, there will be none that aren't occupied. So you pick a seat that's within view of an outlet (or more than one if possible), and you play the waiting game. Oh yes, you sip your soup, tear your bread, take a sip of tea while inconspicuously stealing small glances at the target. Yeah, you're stealthy.

Finally, your patience pays off and you see an opening. You quickly gather your stuff with both arms and head towards the goal. Inwardly, you're racing towards that table. Outwardly, you're trying to move as quickly as you can without looking like you care. You can't lose your cool, you're almost there. You sit, you plug, you win!

Nintendo never came up with Plug Hunt. I did. Why they're making the millions and not me I'll never know.  

Some time later, after I've settled into my castle, a girl apologizes looking slightly embarrassed and asks me if she can just set her laptop on one of my chairs so she can use the outlet next to it. I decided to share my conquest with the less fortunate. Apparently, another way to win Plug Hunt is to make an ally. Genius.  

Somewhere amidst the excitement, I also had some food. For the third time at the third Panera, a bowl of soup came out when I ordered the cup. However, the difference this time was that I was only charged for the cup and got the bowl. I'm an honest person, but I really doubt they would want to scoop 4 oz. of soup from my bowl back into their pot so I just ate it all. The baked potato soup had many chunks of potato in it and was probably the most filling soup I've had there.

Last time I was here, the side baguette was borderlining burnt. This time, it didn't have that nice crisp on the outside that I've come to expect from Panera. I think the bread at the Huntington Beach location just tastes better, or maybe I'm just imagining, but it would be strange to imagine something like that.

It's probably useful to know they enforce the "peak hours" rule here. From 11:30-1:30 and 5:30-7:30, your internet time is limited to 30 minutes. I understand why they do this. After all, the place is teeming with college students, most likely from Cal State Fullerton a block down. I'm sure Plug Hunt was a clue to how crowded this place gets. But I did partially choose Panera over other places because of wi-fi access, and it's annoying to not be able to use it.   

The food was decent, but Plug Hunt isn't something I want to play all the time, and 30-Minute Surfing with Panera isn't my favorite show either. Of course, if you're there for the sole purpose of eating or drinking, have an 8-hr. battery for your laptop, or perhaps brought something old-school like a book, you shouldn't run into any problems.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Friendly workers will always have me coming back!

This place is right by my school, so I come here to study from time to time. The last time I was here, I was telling the cashier that I was a little chilly, and she kindly informed me that they have a nice fireplace in the middle of their dining area. Who knew? PERFECT study spot. I was nice and toasty. Thanks for the suggestion!

For the amount of traffic this location gets, this place is pretty clean and speedy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this Panera. It is conveniently located by Cal State Fullerton. Every time I step into here I'm greeted by smiling, kind faces. It's generously spacious and not overbearing with people. 
I love that I am suggested to try new things and that employees are incredibly knowledge about their food. I trust them wholeheartedly and I've never been disappointed!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here to meet a client and ordered the bacon egg on ciabatta bread. It was ok, nothing to get excited about. My client ordered coffee and a pumpkin muffin. There was no coffee so I told the girl behind the counter and she said in a frustrated tone" its coming in 5 min". 
When we got the order they brought the wrong pastry. The same coffee lady delivered it. We told her it was wrong. She came back and basically tossed it at us in a bag. 20 min later my client goes and checks the coffee still no coffee. What a disappointing experience.

Maybe coffee lady was having a bad day but still...be cool.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just trying to leave and pick out our pastries on the way out. And the young man at the counter at the time gave me greaf over not having an exter slip of paper for my said pastrie and my receipt clearly said 2 undecided. The young man clearly couldn't make a corporate decision to save his life, unfortunately he had to get the manager to over see the decision.  You shouldn't have to give a DNA sample for a cookie you already paied for..  what can you do.. Happy New Year. And yes i got my cupcakeand his cookie  too<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">About 90% of the menu is less than desirable. From multiple visits, I've discovered that your safest bets lie with the hot sandwiches. 

Specifics:
Frontega Chicken is consistently tolerable.
Cuban Chicken is salty.
Smokehouse Turkey is good.
Chipotle Chicken is good.
Mac and Cheese is uncomfortable comfort food.
Thai Chicken salad is by far the worst salad I've ever had.
Chicken Cobb comes tossed in a weak and oily vinaigrette. 
Steak bits are impotent.
Mango smoothie is decent.
Coffee is decent.
Tea selection is poor with only two "normal" teas (Green and Earl Grey).
Shortbread and Toffee cookies are good.
Brownie is a brick.

Generalities:
Salads over all are disappointing.
Soups are poorly balanced and often too salty.
Dining area is only mildly littered.
Bathrooms is filthy.
Service is minimum wage quality.
Order accuracy is good if you don't mind repeating yourself five or six times.
Pastries are old and dry and if you want anything warmed up, "The microwave is over there behind you."

Yeah....no......<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can get a solid light meal here for a decent price. The "Pick 2" is what I usually go for. You can choose between soup, salad, and/or 1/2 a sandwich. It also comes with a choice of baguette, chips, or apple.

Every time I go, I get something different. They have a wide variety and I have yet to be disappointed.

The cashiers could use some courses in hospitality though. They're not rude by any means. However, they're not warm and welcoming either.

All in all, a convenient spot for me to sit down, brainstorm, and grab a quick bite.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Watch the fine print. Only 99 cents for any bakery treat BUT you have to buy a lunch or dinner AND a drink. Rip off. Soup, salad & sandwiches OK. Bakery is marginal. Decent counter service with pleasant employees.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yay, I am a fan.  Unfortunately.  I used to LOVE this place, come here to do my homework and all that.  But then I discovered that their "healthy" and "fresh" food is neither healthy nor fresh and it really bothered me.  I stopped coming here for a really long time.  Like a few years.  

Then the cravings for the sesame simanola bread took over and I could no longer resist.  I don't come here more than a few times a year.  I only order 1 thing, the same thing every time.  Tuna sandwich on, you guessed it, sesame simanola bread.  The tuna is not low fat, but it is really chunky and great with the brown mustard they use.  My mom and I both love the Fuji Apple Chicken salad, it is realllly good.  Just getting a salad does not fill me up enough for the price or amount of calories it comes with.  The "you pick 2" option is great for my mom, but I just stick with the whole sandwich because it is the most filling.  I do have to say that the portion sizes for the pick 2 option have gotten bigger (or at least it looks like it has, but knowing how this place deceives people it could just be an optical illusion) which is nice.   

I understand the appeal this place has for some people, but I refuse to give them my business more than a few times a year, and only if Piology is too busy first.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I used to come here all the time. The food is still good and the staff is still really friendly and I enjoy talking to them. But their wifi is super slow and it now logs you out after 30 minutes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Being a student at CSUF, I've been here several times over the years. I feel like it's gotten worse and worse. The service is horrible. The workers look miserable behind the counter and when a female worker delivered my food, she basically just threw it on my table. Not coming back here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I never really knew where Panera Bread fit into the scheme of things, but upon visiting one, I now know. The common thing that I saw here were students with textbooks and lounging senior citizens. I cannot say I am a fan of the place, but from the outside, it's certainly welcoming and clean. On the inside, there was plenty seating and friendly staff. Hot and iced coffee had free refills.

-=-Iced Chai Tea Latte-=- Not the greatest. Drinkable, but not overly suite. Almost tasted like there was soy in there.

-=-Apple Crunch Muffin-=- It's a muffin! It ain't a Costco muffin, because we all know that those are the BEST.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Why do I go to Panera Bread? Because it's predictable.

I knew exactly what I wanted and I knew it would taste ok.  I was hungry and I was too lazy to go eat so a night sandwich pick-up was perfect.

The workers were friendly and they helped me right away.  Free wi-fi too!!

3.5 stars!!

Panera Bread is yummylicious!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A nice place for coffee, bread, pastries, and soup.  Free wifi makes it a potential for hanging out. Nice atmosphere makes it a great place to meet.   I prefer here over Starbucks but it's seldom my idea to come here.  A little pricey compared to a donut shop but hey, I know value when I see it. You pay for the atmosphere here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place just becomes more and more unwelcoming with their ridiculous wifi 30 minute usage windows (the windows for limited wifi usage keep getting longer and longer).  Now, they are covering up all of the plugs with impenetrable plastic covers.  What??<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">AOK to get a decent meal and free wifi.

MInimal outlets, but with a full battery you can get your grub on and java-fi (coffee with free wifi).

I found both the quality of the food and the service to be inconsistant here.
Sometimes the staff is great, and sometimes they are not. The coffee is aok and is probably the only thing that I have found to be consistant.

If I am in the area, and I need to Java-fi, I come here over the starbucks across the street.

AOK.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've tried the Roasted Chicken Artichoke Panini, Frontega Chicken Panini, and the Tomato & Mozzarella Panini.  TRY THE FRONTEGA AND TOMATO/MOZZARELLA PANINIS!  Those paninis taste like they came from heaven.  The Roasted Chicken Artichoke Panini is okay, but not my favorite.  I've tried French Onion Soup and the Vegetable Soup (or Minestrone?  I think that one is only available during Lent, but I'm not entirely sure).  Both are okay, but I've tasted better.  I recommend getting the "You Pick Two" deal for $10-12 (you choose two of either a 1/2 a cup of soup, 1/2 a sandwich or panini, or 1/2 a salad) with a panini and soup (I personally don't like salads), just to be able to try different things from the menu.  However, every time I choose this item, I regret not buying the full panini because they're just so darn delicious and I don't like the soup as much as the panini.

I wouldn't suggest getting the pasta if you want a filling meal.  It's $6-7 for a really small bowl of pasta.  We go the Tortellini Alfredo. It was honestly a let down.

I've tried the chocolate chip cookies and M&M cookies, and both are pretty large and super delicious.

I only took off one star because it's a little expensive, and I didn't like the size of the pasta bowl.  Once, I ended up paying about $22 for lunch for me and my brother.  But if you really want quality food and don't mind too much about costs, go here.  So delicious.

There's free wifi, but unfortunately if you go during lunchtime or dinnertime, they usually only allow you to surf for 30 minutes since those are the busiest times of the day.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Poor service, wrong coffee type and extremly sweet latte. Forget an order and overall not coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Expensive!

A $9 "steak" and blue cheese sandwich consists of cold cut deli meat style beef, that is not steak.  I can go to the Habit and get a real steak sandwich for $5 that's way way better.

Soup in a bread bowl.  Bread was ok, but it's a bakery, shouldn't it be great?  Soup tasted like from a can.

Never going back.  Why is place always so crowded?  Free wifi?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What do I have to say about Panera, eh nothing special just average food at best. The only thing I have enjoyed so far are their French toast bagels and the cream cheese is also a delight ! I don't know about you, but if I'm going to drop 12-16 dollars on lunch it should be better than average. Just saying, I rather go to Pita Hot or pieology which are both nearby.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Prices on foods seem to have soared. The cheapest you pick 2 is now $7.98 plus tax, and that's a soup and basic salad. My soup and half tomato mozzarella panini was $9.78 plus tax. With the new style of menu set-up I couldn't tell the prices until ordered, then I decoded their funky display.  My husband ordered half an asiago steak sandwich and it was $6 for about 4 inches of baguette, a couple slices of steak, and a piece of cheddar. I was really disappointed with the value and that will likely be our last trip to Panera. Previously, we loved it there and it was a good place to spend just a little more than fast food. Now, I'd rather go to chili's for a lunch special. Sorry Panera, we have to break up. Your food is still tasty, but I don't want to pay for it anymore.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have to comment on my last experience here. I had the unfortunate experience of studying next to some corporate head of Panera. She had to be important since all the employees were practically bowing down to her or backing away in fear. She was in some kind of financial/management/something or other meeting with another Panera corporate head.

What turned me off so much was an obvious attitude of disrespect toward the employees. This lady would yell from her table to the register "HEY! Is there a line?" " Hey (insert employee name), COME HERE!"

First of all, I'm trying to study, so please stop yelling across the restaurant. It's distracting and annoying.

Second of all, I'm pretty sure your rude behavior is in no way motivating to the staff. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they were all quietly wishing they could quit at that moment in time. 

One of the conversations, I was oh-so-privileged to hear (note: sarcasm):
Rude corporate lady: Where is (insert some place)?
Employee: Oh, it's past the DMV. 
Rude corporate lady: That means absolutely nothing to me.
Employee: It's kinda far, but it's past the DMV.
Rude corporate lady: Really, that means absolutely nothing to me. Do you think I'm familiar with this area because I'm not. Tell me something that actually means something to me.

Granted, the employee should have been more location specific on the second try, but there's no reason to talk down to another human being like this. 

As a fairly frequent patron, the service has always been superb. And you, rude corporate lady, totally ruined it for this Panera. I was on the verge of telling her off to her face. But like the coward I am, I decided to save it for the eyes of Yelp.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Over rated commercial corporate chain. Prices don't match the quality if ingredients. Just give me good food at a decent price. I'm not interested in listening to hipster employees talk about what they did the other night. Keep it professional .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service was good and the staff was friendly. Food was good as always. Would definitely recommend this Panera to others.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Frequent visiter at paneras, but its a hit and miss with the taste. I usually get the chicken frontega, which needs more taste and is sometimes smothered by tomatoes or the burnt taste of the bread and the caesar salad, which I absolutely love, though I wish they weren't so stingy with the dressing. 
Best thing here for me is the caesar salad, since the dressing always makes the salad.
As a panera card member, random freebies are the awards, and today, i was looking at the cranberry orange smoothie that was hanging from the ceiling and the cashier said my freebie today was a free drink, and I chose the smoothie. Because I don't like the taste of yogurt too much, this was a bad choice, which was more yogurt than cranberry or oranges.
Anyways, good place to study, eat, and chat, but pretty pricey for the taste and quality.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I always order the Mediterranean Veggie sandwich with tomato soup and a side of bread here. this combo may be light but it is filling. and the taste is also great for a vegie sandwich.  the staff are always friendly whenever I see them, so it makes the food more enjoyable when i have quality food and quality customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We received catering from here for a club.  I had half of the bacon turkey bravo sandwich, and you can't go wrong with bacon! I can't remember the other half of a sandwich I had- but the raw onions can be off-putting. Overall yummy,healthy,and filling.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have eaten at various Panera's over the past 7+ years, but this by far was not the same level of quality. The sandwich I ordered was not made with care. It was a scoop of chicken with 2 slices of tomato and 1 ugly piece of lettuce between 2 pieces of blah bread. The chicken salad was still in the shape of a scoop, it wasn't even spread over the whole piece of bread. The salad was mostly lettuce and needed more dressing. I guess that's what I get for trying something different :/<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I come here occasionally to read. I like Panera because it has free wi-fi, except a restriction of 30 minutes usage during 11:30am - 2:30PM rush hours. 

I like the bagels here in Panera, definitely recommend the cinnamon flavor. The price of each bagel is a bit higher than a regular bagel. If you care about the price, then you definitely don't want to get bagels here. But I like how I can spend time reading my books, using internet with just a purchase of a bagel + coffee,I think it's worth of the price.

I would want to recommend the spinach souffle for breakfast, it was good, not too much for a breakfast. This is the only thing that i ate most of the time when I visit Panera.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera is usually consistent from location to location but this one is fortunate to have a super friendly staff.  I have often gotten my order incorrectly but no fear they will fix it with a smile and usually offer you something for the trouble.  

great staff!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of my favorite food place during college time! The food are decent with about 10 dollars spend.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Panera. But I hate that this location constantly tries to close early. I am pregnant and was craving soup and got there 10 minutes before they closed and the girls wouldn't let us in because they said they were closed already. All I wanted to do was take some soup home, not spend an hour inside. If you're gonna say you're open until a certain time, then stay open. That's all....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My niece likes their macaroni & cheese.  My wife likes their cinnamon crunch bagel.  I like some of their snacks like the cookies and danishes.  The prices are a bit high compared to similar places.

The staff are good, and the restaurant is clean.  This location has many customers who are students so they get very busy.  Many of the students study here as well.  

It is not the best Panera location, but they are worth checking out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came in today and ordered my usual; chicken and wild rice soup in a bread bowl with chips. When brought to the table, my plate was missing the bread bowl. After asking if I could get the bread bowl sent out on the side, the waiter took a look at my receipt and said, "next time, make sure you order the bread bowl." Taken back by his tone, I acknowledged his statement with a smile, but I really wanted to say, "I DID order it!" Hm...

The soup was good though...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Today bought a bowl of soup and a bread bowl of another soup to go. The way it is advertised in the restaurant gives the impression that bread bowl is the bowl of soup plus  the bread. When I came home I  realized the fake advertising. It basically is a cup of soup (or something similar but surely not a BOWL of soup) and the bread. Just be aware when you order bread bowl. I am sure it is their money maker<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Is it just me or is this Panera slightly more expensive than other ones? Maybe it's cause the last location I went to was in Atlanta, and life is just cheaper outside of CA. Needless to say, I was shocked that a SIMPLE lunch for me and my boyfriend came up to 21 dollars. He got a sandwich and I got the you pick two. 

The food is good, but not 21 dollars for a two lunches good.

I'll stick to Corner Bakery.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the mac and cheese here. Their paninis are also very good!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This weekend, I needed to grab food and then work for a few hours, with free internet so I headed over to Panera. 

I was intrigued by some of their breakfast sandwich offerings (egg sandwiches and the like) but I arrived at about 11 am, which is when they stop serving breakfast.  

Instead, I ordered the 1/2 Soup/Sandwich combo.  It's typically about $6.99 but if you order a Premium sandwich as I did, it's a bit more at $7.50.  I selected the Smoked Turkey with Artichoke & Spinach Spread with Caramelized Onions on Ciabatta.  It was tasty but far richer than I expected.  The spread was essentially spinach dip.  For my soup, I selected French Onion.  It was not bad.  It was beefy and oniony and not too salty as french onion soups tend to be.  The only disappointment was the lack of the cheesy crouton that makes this dish sooo good.  Instead there were three croutons and shaved asiago cheese thrown in.  The cheese didn't properly melt and instead coagulated in clumps that I just avoided.

He ordered the Chicken Club with chicken, bacon, tomato and cheddar grilled together with a side of the Panera chips.   His iced coffee was underwhelming but they do provide free refills so that's one plus.  

What really astounded me was Panera's new internet policies.  They had always advertised free internet but at least at this location, they limit it to 30 minutes during the prime hours: 1130-130 pm and 530 to 730 pm.  In addition, most tables and booths previously had their own electric outlets.  At this location, the majority were covered up.   This location is extremely close to Cal State Fullerton so I expect that these changes are efforts to deter students who camp there for full days without ordering much.  Still, they should consider opening back up some plugs...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Disappointing visit.  Food was OK, but:
-The floors are very dirty
-The tables are dirty with crumbs (somehow even after they are cleared)
-The drink area is messy

Makes me wonder about the cleanliness in the kitchen....

They also blocked off most of the power outlets.  Using my laptop here was half the reason I chose to dine here in the first place.

Then the salad, drink, and cookie was over $15 during lunch.  Thats too much for an experience like this.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like this place!  The staff are friendly.  The food is good and some of the selections are healthy.  Its close to CSUF and convenient.  A nice place to study while eating or snacking too : )

I will definitely be coming back.  Don't forget to use your rewards card too; extra free pastries is a bonus!

Close parking is limited to 2 hours.
Free green tea refills!

Hours are good as well!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Got taken here by a friend, (you know who you are =[  )  for lunch and the first thing that crossed my mind was, why does it smell stanky in here? Nastiness. 

First impression was, this place looks like a Corner Bakery with similar offerings, and you order at the counter, but that's where the similarities stop. The food is way over priced. Their best "deal" is the "Choose 2," It's a choice of 2 of the 3: half soup, half salad or half sandwich. Starts at $7 and goes up from there if you want anything more than the basic sandwiches. 

I got a half tuna sandwich, half greek salad and an apple. $8 something after tax. WTF! 

Got my food delivered to the table and they gave me a bag of chips instead of the apple. Hello! I'm trying to eat healthy! Thankfully the server was polite about their mix up. 

BOTTOM LINE: Dropping almost $10 for lunch (especially when it's a half salad/ half sandwich) is a big no-no. Never returning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is nice but why r they so pricey? I don't mind coming in here once in awhile...but it's kinda hard when my classmates wants to meet here like all the time!!

I like that they have free wifi...the bad part is you can only be on during the peak hours for 30 minutes at a time...and because it's near CSUF..it's totally crowded by students so it can get pretty hectic there so you can't really study..and even having a meal there might not be worth it most times!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">the quick:
they have souffles! cheeky!

The souffle, although tasty was not impressive than a heart alertos breakfast burrito. It's a fun item to have once in a while but barely worth $4. A little doughy and lacking.

The menu is more expansive than corner bakery but the feel of the menu is about the same.  They offer a lot of teas and drink choices, almost and equal arsenal to the food menu.

Free wifi & a nice cafe interior makes this place an easy choice for chillen casually.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Solid.

They have decent food.
They have decent bread.
They have decent service.

Better than most fare in the area.  If you need food, this is a good place to come.  They have it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The service I received when ordering my food was great, but everything after was not. I have been to other panera's before and have ordered the same food on a regular basis. When I ordered my food here, I found that the tuna sandwich that I ordered was smaller than the palm of my hand, and one slice of bread was smaller than the other. Also, I  ordered to broccoli cheddar soups, and they both tasted terrible; my stomach began to hurt after I had eaten it.

I called to make a complaint, and spoke with the general manager. I originally explained that I was disatisfied with the tuna sandwich, and she questioned why I waited till I left the store to make a complaint, instead of doing so while I was there. It wae not until I explained that my order was to go and that I did not notice the issue with the sandwich till I sat down to eat. She offered me a refund for my order, which I gladly took; but I did not appreciate the way in which she handled the situation.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm the girl always standing in line then moving to the beack because i can't figure out what I want.

Ah Panera! My first college lunch date awhile back! I was confused about everything and couldn't decide on what to eat. Now, I can officially just say : the usual

On most days I would get a cup of soup with a baguette and on hungrier days i'd get half a sandwhich and a cup of soup!

Now, I would always get the Clam chowder BUT they don't seve it everyday :( And once they acidentally gave me creamy tomato soup WHICH I am in love with!

I enjoy this enviroment and it's near school so makes it all the better! Oh join My Panera club, the perks are WONDERFUL!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Friend was hungry after class and suggested we come here. 

The place is pretty good, but it's nothing too special or fancy to me. The place does feel a lot like Corner Bakery, but I prefer Corner Bakery myself. 

Menu is simple, also has that same type of deal CB has - 2 items 1/2 sandwich & salad or soup. 

My friend recommended the broccoli cheese soup, but the second I saw baked potato I had to get it. She thinks its better as well, and plans on getting that soup from now on haha. 

I also got a smoked ham and swiss sandwich, which I didn't know came with mustard. If it the mustard wasn't there, which I assume you could ask for none, I would've enjoyed the meal a bit more.

They actually forget my order too, I had to go to the counter since 15 minutes passed and my food wasn't there. They offered me a free cookie for the wait/mistake/whatever - but I declined the offer. I probably should've gotten a cookie to try it out though, oh well. 

A lot of people come to study and it's pretty quiet, I might just walk over from campus to here to read my book and eat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Panera is in a convenient location because it is close to all of the colleges in the area.  It serves as a great alternative to studying in the library and the free wifi is an added bonus.  I like that I feel comfortable to stay and study since over half of the people eating there are studious students.  Panera wants you to stay :)  I was there recently for dinner and then coffee afterwards.  First I got a panini which was toasted perfectly and then I had a yummy latte with a shortbread cookie and some orange scones.  I was in coffee/study heaven.

Panera is a delicious place to get your study on.  Just make sure you are at a table near an outlet.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My husband and I came here for their soufflés. I asked the cashier if they have anymore bacon or artichoke soufflés. She said no...we only have whatever is out here. I asked do you have any in the oven baking. Manager overheard and responded... No we sold out. We stopped baking already. 15 mins later I saw new soufflés came out. They outright lied to us because they were too lazy to walk a few steps to the kitchen to ask or check. This is horrible. Never coming back here again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Panera. Fresh produce on all salads,delicious pastries and yummy soups. Only drawback is it can get a bit pricey, so sign up for their free membership that garnishes you discounts.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Two stars because of the lousey service.  Saturday morning rush and one person at the register.  No big.   I planned on hanging out a bit and saw that they had just brought out more souffle.   Good for me right.  Got coffee,  b green smoothy,  got a table number for my souffle.  Sat down, did my thing,  waited and waited and waited.  40 minutes later I was done.  Went to find someone explained I never got my order after 40 minutes.   She packed a souffle up said 'here you go' and walked away.  No apology for your long wait.  Next Saturday I'm going across the street to Starbucks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I tried the new shrimp sandwich with the cord chowder this time and it was absolutely delicious.  The only negative side on this visit was the service.  The person who brought me my food just put my plate down and took my number without saying a word.  The line to order was ridiculously long and I almost contemplated walking out and going to Pieology next door.  I love Panera but some of their locations just have bad service.  I think some re-training is in order.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We go to Panera a lot to study because they have outlets, booths and good food so we can stay here for hours. they also offer free wi-fi, we don't use that as much but its a nice option. I found studying at this particular Panera is horrible. There are four outlets in the entire place... At random places too. Who does that? SO inconvenient. There was a table near an outlet and the party of six left 15 minutes ago and the table had not been bused. We had to put the plates away and wipe down the table ourselves. The bathrooms were also unpleasant. This Panera compared to other ones I've been to is the worst. I'll go back to the one in Redondo Beach any day. I would have given them one star, but the food is still good so they get two. Also, the crowd here is obnoxiously loud. This is possibly due to the fact that its location attracts high school and college students.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here for the first time with my friend to catch up. It's a really nice place - lots of tables and light shining in. Pretty good food. 

The Pick 2 special is really nice so that you can get half two different things and get to try more things. I really enjoyed the Cuban Panini and Fuji Apple Salad I chose. You can also chose to get bread, chips or an apple. Since New Years, I'm trying to eat healthier so an apple is great!

The atmosphere is great. There are people there just to eat and catch up with people, but there are also people on business lunches so I didn't feel like I was in a completely casual zone. 

They also have a really nice fireplace that splits the two areas in the dining room. It's nice and warm there. My friend and I chose a nice sunny day too so that was definitely nice. 

It's a great place to catch up with friends and Starbucks and Yogurtland are right across the street if you need something different!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What has happened to this Panera?  It was dirty everywhere. Food and trash on the floor and the trash can near the front door had garbage and food all over the top. The restroom was filthy and both stalls had no TP. I had to go ask someone to service the restroom.  Lots of food on the floor throughout. Not like other Panera locations.  I guess we will be driving a little further to the Brea location.  How disappointing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food tastes great, but be warned: check the nutrition facts!

Staff is helpful, when you can get ahold of them...this is a very busy location.

Free coffee refills, which makes this place great for studying all day!

Again, check those nutrition facts!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered the 1/2 sandwich + salad. I got the smoked turkey breast and Caesar salad.. Salad was okay. The sandwich, however, was way too salty..didn't even bother finishing it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Staff is rude, one lady walked by this table 6 times not wanting to pick up a single dish, and the food is over priced.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Cleanliness (-1 star)...Its a beautiful day and the inside is crowded so I sat outside. My table is filthy and the floor beneath it has a pool of drying soda.

Coffee (-2 stars)...There are empty urns of the coffee that I want and the other options are old. The manager said that there is a fresh urn brewing but after 5 minutes of waiting I decided to get the old coffee

Wifi (-1 star) 30 minute wifi connection limit? on a Sunday? thats about enough time to check my facebook and write this review

I usually have a good experience at panera, but this panera in general always seems to bring the rest of the panera's down. It pains me to give this review, but my voice must be heard<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I absolutely Love this place. When I was going to CSUF, I just couldn't get out of this place. It's the perfect place because 1. you can study for as long as you want, 2. free wifi, 3. you can eat while you study, 4. good atmosphere for studying or having lunch with friends, 5. good food!

the only thing I do have to say about the studying is there aren't very many outlets, so you need to either sit close enough to reach an outlet or not need an outlet.

My favorite is the you Pick Two special. 

My favorite soup is the Chicken and Wild Rice....best I've ever tasted! Long grain and wild rice, celery, onion, carrot and diced chicken simmered in chicken broth embellished with cream and select herbs. Especially on a cold, rainy day, so yummy. 
My second favorite is the broccoli cheddar with chopped broccoli, shredded carrot and select seasonings simmered in a velvety smooth cheese sauce.

The salads are pretty good. My usual is the Greek or Caesar salad. 
The Greek salad has Romaine lettuce, vine-ripened tomatoes, feta cheese, peperoncini, red onions, Kalamata olives, pepper & their Greek dressing. 
The Caesar salad has Romaine lettuce, Asiago-Parmesan cheese, homemade Asiago cheese croutons & their Caesar dressing. Yummy!
 I also occasionally like the Fuji Apple Chicken Salad: All-natural, antibiotic-free chicken, mixed field greens, romaine lettuce, vine-ripened tomatoes, red onions, pecans, Gorgonzola, apple chips & white balsamic apple vinaigrette.

My favorite sandwich is the SmokeHouse Turkey: Smoked turkey breast, smoked bacon, smoked cheddar & sun-dried tomato ale mustard grilled hot on Artisan Three Cheese bread. Obviously, its the BACON that gets me :)
I also like the Bacon Turkey Bravo: Smoked turkey breast, bacon, smoked Gouda, lettuce, tomatoes & signature dressing, on Tomato Basil bread.

Oh and one of my new favorites is the Mac n' Cheese with Vermont white cheddar cheese....unbelievably tasty! must try!

Whether you want to grab a quick lunch or study all day long, this is the perfect place because you can have breakfast, lunch, and dinner and never have to leave your study spot!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went here for the first time a couple days ago and ordered an asiago roast beef sandwich ($7.29) and a cinnamon roll ($2.99). The sandwich was fairly good, but small for the price. The cinnamon roll was pretty large and tasy, but doesn't compete with the ones at Cinnabon or anything. Overall a decent lunch. The sandwich, cinnamon roll and soda came out to over $13. Definitely not a good value for a simple lunch!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was so totally disappointed with this Panera!

I'm usually a big fan of Panera bread. I love the bagels, sandwiches and soups. But I came here for breakfast yesterday morning with my friend and was totally let down!

I ordered the Breakfast Power sandwich. It was ham, egg and cheese on multi grain bread. How could I go wrong with that, right?

I also got a nonfat caramel latte and it was delicious. But, for $8 I got the latte and half of a sandwich. REALLY?!! I couldn't believe it. When my sandwich came, it was very small. Half of a sandwich, to be exact. The bread was toasted, but soggy and it seemed like the whole thing had been microwaved.

I won't be back to this location!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera Bread is a bad knock off of Corner Bakery. The food quality is poor and it often tastes as if the paninis sit for hours before they are heated up and sent out. The soups are too salty and the salads are always lacking a good amount of dressing. Also forget about modifying your order, I have been told no on numerous occasions. Also even when they do say yes, onions mysteriously creep up on my order. I've had to send them back several times. 

Also the service is AWFUL. The managers with the exception of Mike all have terrible manners and talk about personal matters in front of customers. They are not helpful and I will never set foot in a Panera again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Strawberry Poppyseed Chix salad. Pretty darn good. Well trained, friendly staff. Clean store.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I will say this for Panera - the service is AMAZING. Super nice people - both at the register and those filling orders. They are still too pricey for catering (I think - who knows since they won't list their catering prices online), but they do treat you very well when you are there. I was really impressed when I stopped by yesterday.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Had a Mediterranean vegetable sandwich on tomato basil bread. OMG the bread is amazing! Comes with your choice of a bag of chips, apple, or a roll too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a great place to study. I am always greeted with a friendly smile. Their menu and service is great too. 

The internet there is only limited to 30 minutes, and that is the only down-fall. 
I recommend Panera to every study group I am at!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera is what it is- a chain. A well priced chain however, For 6.95 I got a panini and chips. 

I ordered the mozerella and tomato panini, it was ok. The condomints bar saved it with Mayo & tobasco lololol. 

Next time I'll prob get one of their amazing BAKED goods. I dont think the food here is THAT great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like this place.  I'm surprised at all the mediocre reviews.  I frequent this one often.  I usually get a salad to go.  They are always on time and my food is fresh.  The steak and blue cheese salad is great. I've also gotten the chicken and avocado, another excellent choice.  I've been staying away from the pastries, though they sound good right now. Plenty of seating.  Parking is fine if you're there for less than 30 minutes.  We'll see what happens when school starts.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great environment for studying and hanging out with friends. Free strong Wi-Fi. Delicious berry smoothie. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera bread oh sweet panera bread, how i love thee! even though you are fattening, BUT thats not the point! ;D

The first time i came into this wonderful sandwich and bakery shop the aromatic smell of their freshly baked goods, salads, soups, and drinks filled up my nose and made my mouth water. The atmosphere reminded me of a starbucks as they play smooth jazz music in the back which makes you feel like you are in a french bistro. 

As i made my way up to the register i didn't know what to get as they had so many wonderful selections and the friendly worker suggested their lunch combo, so i chose to get their Pair Two combo where you get to make your own combinations of Soup, Salad, or Sandwich and it comes with either a side of baguette, Apple or bag of chips.

I went for the Chipotle chicken sandwich, with a side of tomato soup and baguette. It was DELICIOUS, the creamy tomato soup was warm and tasty it really make me feel as if i was home, snuggling up on the sofa and looking out at the cold, chilly weather. On top of the soup came with garlic bread croutons and boy do they explode with the melodious flavors of the soup, match made in heaven. Their chipotle chicken sandwich is by far my favorite. It's freshly prepared chicken breast snuggled in between slices of tomatos, smeared with their smokey, spicy chipotle mayo and topped off with 2 strips of bacon.

Panera bread is the perfect place to do lunch with a friend to just catch up or study up for a quiz while pigging out on some tasty delectable goods whether it be salty or sweet, YUMMY<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The bagels and coffee were good but this is a two star review based on lack of quality customer service. The cashier was friendly so she gets four stars, but everyone else gets two. 
I ordered a bagel and a coffee to go. While I was getting my coffee, the girl who brought me my bagel just placed it in front of the coffee dispensers and said, "Here." She brought my boyfriend's bagel while he was getting his coffee and didn't even tell him it was his. She just flung it onto the coffee dispenser counter and left. Meanwhile, another customer was sent searching for hot water because one of the employees gave her wrong infoinformation as to where she could find it. Or maybe there wasn't any more hot water. Anyway, she asked the manager where she could find it and the manager said, "Here, I'll just get it for you" in a terrible tone. 
Also, I got the last of the hazelnut coffee and watched as two other customers tried to dispense it, only to find that it was empty. 
My cinnamon crunch bagel was to die for. Too bad poor customer service was noticeable in the five minutes I was there!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The summer salad called 'Strawberry poppyseeds and chicken salad' was served w/blueberry pineapple mandarin oranges and pecans.  It was best salad I have had in a very long time.  My salad was bursting with flavor and low on calories.
Wow! Panera, keep up the good work!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My new favorite study spot!  Free wifi, yummy lattes, and they feed you free pastries every once in a while.  A delightful haven for all the universities in the area.

I was surprised to see how packed this place gets.  Came here about 2pm on a Monday and didn't leave until 9pm.  Met my buddy here because he wanted to check out the hot undergrad girls.  Haha, perv!  

They don't try to rush you or kick you out.  Students from CSUF, Western Law School, So Cal Optometry School, Hope Int'l University, and whatever else that's in the area apparently all flock here because I had a tough time finding an outlet for my laptop.

I sipped on a huge cafe latte and my buddy got a frozen blended coffee (about $4 each) as we studied and occasionally facebook stalked and talked out the confusing minds of boys and girls.  Coffee was strong and good and the apple and cherry pastries they were handing out were soooo yum.  I'm not sure how often they give out pastries like that.

Nice study ambiance with jazzy music playing in the background.  However, it gets loud with all the juicy student gossip spilling and people laughing and mingling.  I'd recommend to bring some headphones to zone out and focus on your hw.

7 hours later, I was on a caffeine high, finished the equivalent work I could've done in an hour at my apartment, learned about who Grace and Adam are currently dating and what they did for Valentine's weekend and planned a trip to Vegas.

Overall, very productive day.  I'll be meeting my fellow grad students here again for some good studying sessions!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been going to this Panera for about 4-5 years since I went to CSUF and work in the area.  So to my co-workers and I, Panera is our usual spot.  I've always had a pleasant take out experience with Panera but recently...the service have been less than satisfactory...

The food always taste fresh and good.  Service used to be good but now it seems staff got their training cut short.... I recently went to Panera for brunch take-out and had the worst service ever from the cashier....

I would've gave them 4 stars for the fresh food and good soup but instead they get 3 stars for making me go back 3 times to get my complete order... One thing I can't complain about is the manager, Kendra, for trying to make the situation better by giving me freebies which was awesome! But next time, I rather eat my soup while it's hot! 

Thanks Panera for fresh food and delicious soup but unless I reallyyyy crave for bagel...I'll go some where else for my brunch!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is pretty good. It's a good place to go if you're not feeling fast food but need to get out pretty fast. The atmosphere is really comfortable and is good for meeting and having a nice lunch with your friends. The bread is really good! Food is alright but nothing that amazing, its just convenient if your low on time. The crispanis suck! don't get fooled by the delicious sounding descriptions. I normally get the half sandwich half salad thing. 

 That parking lot is so hard to get out of!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Coffee cake and desserts are good.

However, went for breakfast today, and for $4, I got a very small egg sandwich I was not impressed with.  And instead of sausage I ordered, they put bacon.

And after some cups fell onto the floor, they put them back for general usage...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera is a pretty good restraunt.  I really enjoy the chicken ceasar salad and the confortable atmosphere.  I could however due without the 10,000 questions when talking to the cashier.  They seem to be able to take a 2 minute transaction and stretch it out way too long.  In addition they never seem to notice the line piling up as they ask yet another unneccessary question.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great survice! Love the food! Perfect place for anyone to eat at.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome place to go to when you need your study mode ON. Since I'm more of an early morning rather than pulling an all-nighter person, this Panera on Chapman is probably my favorite place to study. They open at 6 am Monday-Saturday and at 7 am on Sundays. Another plus is the hot and iced coffees are endless and the food tastes great! They also have a rewards program where you can earn points to get discounts or free food.  The only negative about this Panera is that they never have soups before 9 which blows because I LOVE their chicken tortilla soup. Other than that, YAY!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome place. Love the chocolate cupcake.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location has a hot water dispenser for tea so you do not have to continually ask a team member for hot water refills. Cool. 
Staff is attentive and friendly. It served well as a business meeting location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There's nothing special about this Panera Bread. The only reason why I come here is to study while I wait for my boyfriend to get out of class. It gets really packed with CSUF students, but it's just very crowded in general even without the people. Why? There's a LOT of tables just bunched around everywhere & these are mostly just two seater tables. It's really cramped to sit, eat, &/or study. I've seen so many people bump chairs into the person behind them bc they're so close together.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually only come here when I am at school and starving. It hits the spot. There is fast service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered a tomato soup bread bowl to-go. When I got home, I checked the bag, and there was no bread bowl. SERIOUSLY???? This is not acceptable. How can you forget a bread bowl on an order of tomato soup with a bread bowl? Ridiculous!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Holy jesus, the food was on the table BEFORE I was!!  I had to get my drink first and it beat me there! Now that's what I call service!! And the food here is always delicious. Tomato soup in a bread bowl along with mac and cheese?? I'm so stuffed it hurts.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera Bread is one of those bakeries where what's good is really good, and what's not so good is actually quite sucky. 

The menu is actually more more diverse than most bakeries of this type, but the problem is the price. A sandwich is about $2 too expensive for the size that you get and the coffees are 7-Eleven quality at Starbucks prices. The green tea is syrupy and doesn't taste like tea.

But what I do like, I like quite thoroughly. The turkey sandwiches are tasty and relatively healthy and the soups are hearty. The service is usually excellent.

I also like that it's a casual sit-down restaurant: more classy than a  fast-food joint but not quite a regular restaurant setting where you have to order from a server or pay a tip. Just a nice place to come and relax if you need to study, hang out with friends, or grab a quick meal.

Overall, though, there's more good than bad, so it deserves a 3 out of 5.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Brian and I come to Panera Bread (either this one or the one in Orange) at least once a week, its quick, inexpensive, fresh, and their service is very friendly.  

We always order the You Pick Two:
I get the fufi apple salad with the vegetarian sandwich.  That sandwich is so darn good, I swear its the tomato basil bread that makes it the bomb!  Last week I also tried the tuna which was very good as well.  

Brian also orders the You Pick Two and gets the fuji apple salad and the roast beef sandwich.  

We love coming here because we can come when we are sweaty and gross right after the gym or come in for a quick cheap lunch or dinner.  Panera never fails us.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Warm panini was nice to have cool morning like today.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">workers there are rude. i called 15 mins ahead of time to order half soup salad and when i get in there the line is out the door so i walk to the front and ask if i have to wait another 20 mins in line when i called it in 20 mins ago and the girl says yes. so i have to wait after people ordering their food when i called it in and pay 13 for 1 cup of soup and half sandwhich. i was pissed and left. get a freaking seperate register for call ins fools<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I always come here for meetings or sometimes to study. I don't know why I bother because I can never get anything done. 

It's just too crowded and noisy, i dont know how others do it.

I do love their soups.

Favorite sandwich would have to be the Mediterranean vegie and my favorite soup is either the new england clamchowder.. so creamyy! it's quite heavenly.  Their french onion soup is good, however it's a bit too salty, I have to have lots of bread with that, I usually get it in the bread bowl for I believe extra $1.50? .  For salad, I like sweet salads so its no wonder why I always get the asian sesame salad with the mandarin oranges. 

It's panera bread. I don't come here to study anymore, but I will come to have lunch with friends and chit chat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera offers clean vegetarian food, which I like.  They  also have many choices in sandwiches, soups, salads and baked goods.  This particular restaurant is clean and the  service is very good.
I really like the black bean soup and the mediteranean veg sandwich.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nice setting with smooth jazz playing! A really nice hangout spot with free wi-fi. 

I've been to many Panera, but this one sticks out. From the interior design to the food served to all the little perks, I adore this little cafe. The staff is courteous and friendly. 

Last week, I ordered my usual: 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad special. I really like their asiago roast beef and Asian sesame chicken salad with a side of apple. They even offered to slice up the apple for me, because I can't bite into an apple. 
 
Today, I ordered 1/2 asiago roast beef sandwich and a French onion soup. I have got to say, they did a good job with the French onion with melted cheese on top. Gotta drink it while it's hot! 

I highly recommend this place to study, grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's what you like), and/or just kick it here with friends. :D<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nothing really special.  Soups sandwiches and a couple other things.  The food was pretty good and the staff are really nice and helpful.  May be back if I am craving some soup or a sandwich.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pros:
1. Super sweet cashiers
2. Amazing, refillable iced coffee (my fav!)
3. Sandwiches are yummy.
4. Free wifi.
5. They let you stay for hours to study! One of the perks of being so close to CSUF.

Cons:
1. Can get a tad pricey (but the service is great.)
2. Sometimes it gets really crowded. Lunchtime brings in all the local students and parking can be a pain.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Breakfast and lunch here is absolutely fantasbulous, their sandwiches are super delicious (freshly made) and salads are heavenly. I used to go here a lot for quick breakfast in the morning and lunch when I worked at the Marriott Fullerton down the street. This place has tons of different types of bread and yummie pastries. My favorite is the Bacon Turkey Bravo, Italian Combo and Roast Beef but everything else on the menu is excellent also. The Asian Sesame Salad is reallie yummie it comes with chicken, almonds, sesame seeds, wonton strips and Asian sesame vinaigrette dressing, very refreshing! You can also do lunch combo, half a sandwich with half salad and a small bag of chips or a whole fruit (their chips are delicious) their breakfast sandwich is the best ever, my favorite is the egg and bacon soooo yummie! 

There's one location in West Covina too...I used to come here to buy pastries for my clients since I work not too far away. There's wi-fi here so a lot of people do come to study or just hang out. If you are into healthy food this is the spot!  I wish there was a location in Westminster/Garden Grove area! I miss you Panera!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had gotten some yummy soup from another establishment, but thought it would be enhanced by putting it into a bread bowl. I went to Panera during the lunch rush. The line was almost out the door, but the three cashiers were speedy, friendly, and efficient. They didn't even laugh at me when I ordered a bread bowl, sans soup. I also got a delicious toasted bagel with cream cheese. The whole experience put me in a good mood - which I really didn't expect. Thanks, Panera!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">"IT'S GOOD, AND GOOD FOR YOU"

Panera Bread is always a good choice. Whether you're going for a cheap date, lunch with friends, or a pastry to get you started in the morning it is a great place to eat for any occasion. The food is very good and healthy enough to not feel guilty. They bake bread and pastries daily. They have pick two combos, where you can get half a sandwich with a half salad or soup. For breakfast they offer bagels, pastries, and breakfast sandwiches. For lunch and dinner they have an assortment of both hot and cold salads, hot and cold sandwiches and panini. I really enjoy their Smokehouse Turkey panini which is served hot. It consists of smoked turkey breast, smoked bacon, smoked cheddar & sun-dried tomato ale mustard grilled hot on our Artisan Three Cheese bread. The sun-dried tomato ale with mustard gives a very unique taste which compliments the bacon and smokehouse turkey perfectly. It comes with a side choice of fruit, baguette, or chips. I get the kettle chips which are great. They also offer vegetarian meals for anyone who opposes the slaughter. 
The service is always great. You order your food at the counter, but they bring your food and so far I have not had any problems. The people who work here are always extremely nice. The ambience is nice, trendy, but comfortably casual which is good for any occasion. The atmosphere is probably a little quieter than most places which is perfect for catching up with someone and being able to talk without being overwhelmed by other sounds.

Healthy, Great Tasting, Always A Good Time!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was thinking 4 stars after I took a bite of the steak salad. DELICIOUS! Then I moved on to my soup.... ehhhh. Not that great. But the steak salad... YES! Get that. Soup and Salad combo comes with you choice of apple, chips or baguette. Cute place to grab a bite to eat. Good customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">so weird i have not yelped this place because i only go to school right next to it...  Well, I am an avid Panera customer.  I preferably like to go on the days they have my favorite soup: Creamy Tomato Soup. (It's delicious, try it at least once. it's like light, sweet and spaghetti-sauce-ish). I enjoy their "You pick Two" deal.. which is half of a sanwich, with a cup of soup, or small salad... and then you get the normal side choices: bread, chips or apple.  

I just love their large menu, and the little pastries they have displayed out there, tempting you to buy them.  The service is always really great, i don't think i've ever had a bad experience there, and i go there alot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nice comfortable setting.  Close to CSUF.  Great for studying ( I'm pretty sure they have free wifi).

They have many different choices..so obviously..I had a hard time making up my mind.  I originally wanted a sandwich..but then i saw their paninis and the cashier lady told me GO PANINI! (she didnt say it like that..but basically..that's what was implied haha!)  So i did as she told.

I wish i went with the sandwich.  I like wheat bread..the panini came with..i dunno something else.  I dont like cheese in my sandwich..but the panini had cheese and they dont take it out because the paninis are premad (-_-)...but..IT WAS STILL YUMMYYY!! haha sorry about all the complaints.  I'm just hating because I was thinking about having a healthier lunch.  Oh well. too bad.  I got a coffee (that is bottomless and yummy) and chips came with my sandwich. cool.

my friend ordered half sandwich with soup.  its a special they have there. or you can do half sandwich with salad!  He enjoyed it! :) and it looked yummy to me!  It made me feel bad about my heavy panini! whatever. i enjoyed it nonetheless :)

and it was good because I only ate half (they aren't huge..but they aren't small) and I ended up eating the other half on my break in class!  Perfect :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ate here with some college buddies after a short meeting. This place is filled with college students either having meetings, doing homework, or grabbing a good and fulfilling lunch/dinner.

The place is spacious and has lots of tables, but their tables are small so you might have to group them if you are coming in as a large party. 

I heard there's free internet here but after 9pm or is it 7pm? you get kicked off every 30 minutes and have to connect again due to the high demand of access around those times. This would suck because I would get really annoyed if I was trying to do work, but constantly got kicked off! =[

The service here was okay, too, but it was my first time so I didn't know what to order. I forgot what I ordered! LOL but the girl was patient enough to answer my various questions. I do remember I got the YOU CHOOSE 2 meal. Choose between 1/2 sandwiches, soups, or salads for 7$ plus you get an extra piece of bread on the side. 

My friend recommended the strawberry smoothie so I ordered this and it was pretty good! It had a taste of yogurt in it which was pretty good and tasted healthy, too! However, everyone else got the lemonade and that looked sooooo good and refreshing! For sure I'll stop by to get some lemonade here sometimes! 

One thing I wasn't sure about was to either leave tip or to not. There was only one girl going around cleaning and throwing away customers' trash, but this place isn't exactly a formal eating environment... more like a huge Starbucks that specializes in bread... so I didn't leave any tip. 

One more thing.. me and my friend both ordered the Caesar salad and hers came with cheese and mine didn't! The cheese is like the best part and I was not happy that I didn't get any! I was going to ask for some cheese on the side, but before I could I ate like 2/3 of my salad so I was like, SCREW IT! hahaha.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like panera bread just fine, but this location needs to work on their service.  My friends and I went in for a late dinner, and asked the cashier if it was all right since they were only open for another hour.. and it was no problem.  But!  the server screwed up our order and huffed and puffed about it and slammed our food down on the table when she brought it back.  Ten minutes later, she comes around (still walking when) she says, "you guys really need to start thinking about finishing up here!" and walks away before we can even respond.  I realize it's been a long day for you, and it's 30 minutes to closing.. but the hours on the door say you're still open.  I don't understand that... just because you're in a rush to go home, shouldn't mean we should be in a rush too.  :T  

I would recommend going to the Panera on Bastanchury.. which is just 2 miles away from this location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay.  I feel guilty.  There is SO much female college @$$ in this place.  I feel that there is no possible way for me not to eat here and NOT feel like I have ADHD.  I mean.  It's all over.  It's to my right.  To my left.  The large lady in the moo moo, who probably isn't a college student, in front of me.  Like Am/Pm says, "Too much good stuff."

On that note, this place is pretty hip looking, I feel.  If Starbucks focused on a restaurant side to their business it might be a lot like Panera Bread.  

This is my first review of the place and I will say I enjoyed my self rather much.  They seem to focus on having fresh organic foods that are light and health conscious.  A lot of their sandwiches, based on what I saw, seem to be grilled on a Panini iron or something similar.  They seem to do that by default as they didn't ask me if I didn't want mine grilled/toasted.  Anyway, I ordered the Chipotle Chick sandwich and I could have beaten up a class of eight year olds because it was SO GOOD.  Their tea is also nice.  But the food seems to be pretty good, reasonably priced and light.

I recommend it.  Ladies, if you take your men here on a school day please allow for them to gawk, oggle and otherwise look.  And if you are an adventurer you could try to find the guest star of your next threesome here.  Of course, I don't see the experimental slutty type here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">THE SKINNY:
A little pricier for a simple breakfast or lunch, but the food quality and great service is well worth the extra $$.

THE GOOD:
First thing you'll see at any Panera Bread location is the assortment of baked goods. It all looks so good (SO good!). It was extremely difficult not getting anything from the display. Fortunately for me I had enough discipline to resist the temptation. The French Onion Soup was a different story however. There was no way I could pass that up. It was friggen' good. I love sweet, caramelized onions and their soup had plenty of it. The gooey cheese with the croutons both softening in broth was absolutely irresistible. I recommend it if you dig onions. Ordered the Smokehouse Turkey  Panini as well and you can really taste the quality. I think the bacon was smoked with applewood because you could taste the sweetness. Their mustard was really good. Really gave the sandwich a nice kick. On top of the good food the girl at the cashier was really cool. My total came out to about $14.03 and she covered the 3 cents. Thank you, thank you, and thank you. I hate it when I have to break a dollar for a couple pennies and get a handful of coin in return. The wait was a little more than 5 mins. (which isn't much of a wait at all), but the guy at the counter still apologized for the wait. Pretty cool. I was impressed.

THE BAD:
They forgot to give me the apple for my side, but I honestly didn't want it anyway. No big deal :]<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The iced tea is really all that is palatable here.  

I can never figure out why the place is so busy at every hour of every day.  The food is mediocre, at best, and the service is painfully slow and crazy.  Let's just say the blank stare is the main method of communication between patrons and employees.  At times, when you get to the cash register, you can't help but think of that scene in Idiocracy when the hospital receptionist is just looking from Luke Wilson to the picture-covered buttons...  Don't get me wrong; the people are generally nice, but sometimes that isn't enough.  

Overall, the food and service are bleh, and the noise level gets crazy (like, oh my GOD, 20-year-olds of CSUF - we don't all need to know what you regret having done last weekend).  Also, we're in Southern California.  Why is the fireplace ALWAYS on in there?!  Are they trying to play up the hell motif?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">my fiancé & I just moved to orange county for his job & although I know this isn't a fancy restaurant or anything I just had to vent about my irritating experience. as someone who has worked in the food service industry for many years I am fully aware of how easy/difficult it is to take a simple order like "chicken avocado cobb salad" & execute it properly. well firstly i'd probably be sure to include the avocado since the ingredient is stated in the name of the dish. I was at work when I received my incorrect meal & unfortunately couldn't do anything about it which was particularly irritating considering I had been charged for the avocado & all my fellow avocado lovers out there know how expensive it is. I normally love Panera & will continue to love it but I wouldn't return to this particular location. ps my boss who ordered a sandwich received it incorrectly as well.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very similar to Corner Bakery...although I prefer CB over Panera. =)

Everything on the menu is pretty good.  I don't think I've ever ordered something I didn't like.  

This place is ALWAYS packed with people who are eating or studying.  They have free wifi and nice tables to study at.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't think I've had bad panera. I'm a big fan of there get 2 option. I usually get the sierra turkey with either Mac n cheese (which is surprisingly good) or potato which is really good. The wait for food is always fast. Plus, they have free wifi to study or go on the Internet. Good location near csuf campus or in Fullerton area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is great. Nice place to study and have your morning OJ or coffee. This place also offers free wifi, which is nice. Only negative thing I have to say is that they always forget to give me butter with my baguette. I always have to ask the kitchen. Otherwise, this place is nice, clean and offers great service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panera is panera is panera everywhere. But the soups are always awesomer than a can, and I'm easily impressed by bread bowls. It's nice not to have to ask if my soup is vegetarian because it's marked and they actually have more than one. Mmm, soup with carbs.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love me some Panera, but this location kind of bums me out.

I went on Sunday about 90 minutes before closing. I was craving their Black Bean soup in a bread bowl. They are out of bread bowls at this point in the night. I am bummed but get a baguette and a cookie instead and I'm pretty happy. Their cookies taste like junior high.

I am still stuck on the concept of eating soup out of a bowl, and then eating the bowl. So I check their website on Monday to see the next time they'd have Black Bean soup. Tuesday. Yes, perfect.

After work I jet on over, order my bread bowl of soup and an apple and am pretty stoked to get it home and down my gullet.

Alas, I get home only to realize I have both soup and an apple but no bread bowl. I am so sad.

The location in Whittier is a million times better. They're staff are crazy nice and fast and efficient even though they are always busy. They are way out of my way, but I will make the trip for all of my future edible  bowl needs.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like the soups here (ALL of them!) but not too big on their sandwiches. It's right next to CSUF so it's buzzing with college students. It seems like the hot spot for study groups.

I really like the jazz singer who comes once in a while and performs live, she even takes requests! (Don't sit too close to her though or you won't be able to hear yourself think.) 

A big complaint I have is the waitress there. Actually, I don't know if she's a waitress (they don't take tips) but she delivers your food. Once she brought a chicken salad sandwich when we had specifically ordered the tuna salad sandwich. Instead of taking it back, she just kept insisting that it was a tuna salad sandwich and "it'll just come back the same way." It was interesting because I actually had the tuna salad sandwich and tried showing her the difference between the two. She just became infuriated and finally took it back.

I've had them make a few other mistakes too but that was the only one worth mentioning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best place to study while enjoying a cup of coffee. Its really close to CSUF which makes it really cool. Unlimited iced or hot coffee, can't say no to that. The staff working here are super friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just discovered this Panera bread and it is good! VERY BUSY during the lunch rush but they are quick to get you your order. I like the Turkey Bravo on Asiago cheese bread-yummy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Satisfactory. Not very customer oriented. Not very helpful. Adequate when dealing with a problem. usually a long wait with only 1 of 4 registers running. coffee is perpetually needing to be refilled.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Of all of the Panera Breads I have been to, this is by far the best!! They have great service for the place being so crowded all the time, the food is fresh, and the people are friendly. If you are closer to the Panera by St. Jude's, drive the extra ten minutes and go to this one next to Cal State Fullerton. It's hard to find a seat during prime times, but it's still faster and much better!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love the orange scones and the coffee is great<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of my favorite places to eat for lunch, and not just because it offers free wi-fi.  I like the menu because it offers much healthier fares than the fast food restaurants close by.  For example, today I had a wholesome black bean soup, mediterranean vegetarian sandwich, and a wonderful multigrain baguette.  If there was no Panera, I would have been forced to choke down garbage from KFC or BK. 

Panera Bread v. Corner Bakery?  In an ideal week I'd alternate between the two.  CB does offer better sandwiches, but they don't sell bagels by the dozen.  So it's a toss up.  

Just don't get the Panera version of chai latte.  It'll give you diabetes!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time coming here. The food is great I had a chicken sandwich with a bowl of tortilla soup. The sandwich tasted fresh and the soup was nice and chunky with all the veggies and tortilla chips. This place has some cool seating with some lounge chairs in the back so you can get on your laptop and do some work. I'd definitely come back to this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I normally love Panera!  I have been to this location before and was pleased with the food and service.  However, the last time I ate at this location December 2010, I was so disappointed.  

The portions were so small.  I got some salad with chicken and pears and it barely had any chicken in it!  We were still hungry after we finished our "snacks" so we ended up getting more food somewhere else.

I thought all Paneras much have made their portions smaller to save money.  I just went to the West Covina Panera and the portions were just as I remembered them being at all other Paneras.  The quality of the food was good as usual.  

So, I'm glad I can still enjoy Panera, just not the Fullerton one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">mmmm Broccoli Cheddar Bread Bowl, it defines my comfort food!
..Also a great study place, especially after an all nighter before a big test!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love eating here, free wi-fi, hip place, convenient for studying. I love the furniture and it's great for groups. The food is always good and consistent in flavor. It's a great option for vegetarians too. My favorite is the broccoli cheddar soup in a sour dough bread bowl. I've never had a problem with staff and the prices are affordable on a student budget.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Occasionally it has been frustrating when they run out of things, but I think things have improved. 

What I like best is the ambience, and that it is NOT the loud, crowded overworked Starbucks across the street. No comparison when it comes to just having a quiet cup of coffee. Plus, the menu is so much more varied.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here for both breakfast and dinner and had a great experience.

The breakfast that I get includes a plain bagel with cream cheese, a chocolate chip muffie, a coffee and a soda. The bagels are quite fresh (when they have them) and the whipped cream cheese is great and easy to spread. They seem to be doing a better job at keeping plain bagels on hand as when I stopped by for breakfast last Saturday around 10 they still had some. That's been rare before! The coffee selections are quite good though they're not always fresh. The employees happily change it out for a fresher brew when asked.

It's not quite clear when they change over from breakfast menus to lunch and then to dinner. The employees are generally quite confused, too, and can never give a correct answer. Some will say that sandwiches are not available until 10AM, though we've ordered some before then.

I had the three cheese crispani for dinner one night. It wasn't great but not bad either. I might get it again to give it another chance because it sounds really good and I want to like it.

The inside seating area is really nice and comfortable. It's easily accessible to multiple schools and is a great place to do homework. The free Wi-Fi is nice but a bit slow. The outside seating is nice, too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place but...it's usually ALWAYS over capacity. It's literally right next to CSFU and that causes a lot of spill over. Other than that, the food is delicious, relatively cheap, great atmosphere, and helpful employees.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually don't have a problem with Panera but this one was gross enough and had bad enough service for me to want to review on here. I wonder if they're a franchise. Anyway, it was 12 noon and this location is a couple blocks from a University so I was curious as to why is was so empty. Well, when I got my salad, most of the leaves were brown. I picked out most of them and ate only the toppings. Then I get to my brownie and it was so hard along the corner and the side, it was inedible. When I took it back to the cashier I knocked it on the counter and it was like knocking my knuckles. The customer next to me laughed. I told the cashier my lettuce was brown and they might have a "quality control" issue. She didn't say the right thing like "I'm so sorry, I'll speak to my manager about this" she just gave me a bitchy look and said really loud and sarcastically "well, I'll get you another bronwie" Never going back there....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">FREE WI-FI!  HEALTHY FOODS!  I like myself some healthy foods after a long week of red meat and sweets.  I think it's great how you you can munch on some healthy snacks and food here while studying or doing work instead of fattening fries.

Similiar to Cornery Bakery but more of a college study spot.    

Best thing is their  "You Pick Two":  Half of a sandwich of your choice with a cup of soup or small salad.  On the side you can choose either a baguette, apple, or a bag of chips. 

and once again FREE WI-FI!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good light meals. Soups and salads are excellent. Price is right. I like the Pick 2 Combo. I don't think their pastries are as good as they look. It's quick and easy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Let's start with arriving at the counter to order. I had to repeat what I wanted to the girl four times. She was clutching her arm, looking around and not listening to me. Finally she got my order right, 1 bagel and 1 iced coffee. She gave me a cup with ice and quickly toasted the bagel. I opened up the rock hard butter packets and tried to put them on the bagel but it was hardly toasted at all and the butter wouldnt melt. I asked them to put it in their oven and they told me they couldnt toast it again. I said, "no i mean, you guys are a bread place, just put it in the oven for a minute." and they told me they didnt have ovens. This must be the only bread bakery on the face of the earth that doesn't have an oven. But I know that's a lie, their company boasts that they come in in the middle of the night to bake their bread for the next day. Now, tell me, how do you bake bread without an oven? Anyway, they then advised me to put it in the microwave for fifteen seconds. If I wanted to microwave a bagel I would have had my mom (who is a horrible cook) make me a bagel. It will get soft. Anyway, I ate my cold bagel with chilled butter on top and it was horrible and disgusting.

This place has terrible customer service. Don't ask for anything warm here, like a bagel.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The only thing i don't like about this place is that there is always a crap-load of students hanging out, doing their homework on laptops.  I don't know why this bothers me, seeing as how i am a student too.  but anyways, the food is really good.  I always get soup and a salad.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everything in this joint is delicious! Their bagels! Their salads! Their sandwiches! Everything tastes heavenly! You gotta try this place at least once !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love the food here but some of the staff need to learn some people skills. I had half a sandwich left (but it was sitting on my plate while I was reading) and a hostess grabbed it without asking, assuming I was finished before I stopped her. They also closed an hour early and did not put a sign on the door indicating this and they didn't inform me before I ordered my food. I had 10 minutes to finish my food. I ended up asking if they closed early and a different hostess just said with a straight face, "Yeah." If I had known that I would have not come. Panera will lose my business for a while. Which is sad to say since I usually frequent the place once or twice a week.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">good place to study and good food. only bad thing is that the food is too expensive<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i've never been to panera bread before and this is actually the first and only one i've been to so far.  the decor of the place is nice and the cashiers are all really friendly.  free wifi is always a plus no matter what.   the only thing i didn't like is the price of the food for what its worth.  i didn't find the food extremely awesome to be worth 8 bucks.  i can get the same deal else where for better tasting food honestly.   i feel like i am paying for the free internet, but i wasn't using it.   i actually like the way the food taste at corner bakery better than panera bread.  :X  its not bad for a chain store, but i would not prefer coming to any of the panera bread because of this overpriced average food experience.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i think the food at panera takes a little getting used to... but the more you eat it, the more you like it.  i just hate that a lot of their stuff is seasonal, which means that it's probably fresh, but you miss it while it's gone. for example, they had this tomato and mozzarella salad (caprese salad at italian restaurants) and it was really good.  but all of the sudden it disappeared.  sucks!
after the disappearance of the salad, the one thing that saved panera from being shunned was their crispanis. crispanis are pizzas on flat bread and they're very crispy and flavorful. the downside, they're only served after 4pm and take 15-20 minutes to make. i usually call in my order on my way home so i don't have to wait. 

* side note: lately there's been this one cashier there and she's sooooooooo slow, it's really irritating when there's a long line.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I star for the positive past experiences I've had at this place, plus 1 star for a delicious cinnamon crunch bagel.  I can't give them any more stars but that for the horrible experience I had today.  Usually I'm pretty easy to please, but when you can't get my order right not only once but twice, you've pretty much put yourself on my s--- list.  I went today to grab a bagel pack and when I came home with they didn't give me the tubs of cream cheese I had ordered.  I went back to get my cream cheeses. then when I got home again, I noticed they didn't give me the flavor I had asked for.  So, lesson to self and others, double check what's in your bag before you leave Panera.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's good, its cute, and you get your food super quick. i was getting my drink and the food was already done before i had a chance to find a table to sit at. lol. its good though!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food, good variety. Sometimes service is slow, but I like the casual environment & free wifi. Any chance of getting the pizza bread before 4:00pm???<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a great new place to get coffee. I love Starbucks but the food choices are not great. This place has both. I will even pick up a fresh roll and butter with my coffee. Yum. It reminds me of my trip to Europe. Coffee and fresh bread. The lunch menu is also great. Soup has lots of flavor but it's not a bargin meal. Worth it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is pricey for not a lot of food... Its great for the bagels in the morning that is all. I usually leave here still hungry. They get an extra star for the free wi-fi<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Welcome to Fullerton, Panera!  You are a very welcome addition to the restaurant neighborhood.  Check this place out for amazing bakery goods, yummy sandwiches, salads, and soups, and a comfortable dining room with wi-fi.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">panera just doesnt instill a 'wow wooweee' quality in me that other sandwich chains have before (ahem... camille's). surprisingly not busy at lunchtime on a monday, we came here to get some sammiches and fill our stomachs. i ordered the chicken salad sandwich. i really did like the fact that they offered side choices such as an apple or chips. the sandwich itself was lackluster and consisted of way too much mayonnaise and not enough flava. no, not flavor... flava! if you dont get it, you obviously don't watch vh1 and i hate you because you apparently have a life outside of television.
anyway, yeah my chicken salad sammich was bleh. it didn't outright suck, but i wouldn't recommend anyone ordering it. my coworker was silly enough to want to switch halves of sandwiches, so i got to try his turkey artichoke panini. it too was just... bleh. it tasted alright, but there was something missing (see wow.. wowwee factor mentioned above). this place just did not tickle my tummy in all the right places and definitely didn't seduce my tastebuds. if youre looking for just an ok sammich served quickly, then by all means head over to panera. if youre looking for taste and quality, go somewhere else.<p>
</p></p>
