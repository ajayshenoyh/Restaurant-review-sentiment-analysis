<p itemprop="description">Spicy seafood soup is absolutely the best ! Great taste , it's like a party in your mouth !! Combination rice was to die for  yum yum . 

The staff is friendly and the place is really nice and tidy . Totally recommend this place to anybody .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thailandia is a Thai restaurant tucked inside the Smart & Final plaza.  This is an okay place for lunch, but expect service to be quite slow.  The pad see ew (spicy thick noodles) is my favorite dish to get at Thai restaurants, but the flavors here are just ok and not as savory as I come to expect (~$10, depends on which protein you choose).  And as you can see from the picture, lots of noodle, only a few slices of bell pepper and pieces of protein. 


It gets busy during peak lunch hours so expect at least an hour from ordering, receiving the food, and getting the bill.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Trying their new BBQ chicken and its amazing because the meat falls off the bone and it tastes amazing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">SOO happy I have finally found a good Thai Restaurant in the area. I have tried multiple different places and decided to try this place because it was one of the few places open after work. 

The service here is so nice. The server is so sweet and wants to make sure that you have everything that you need. I ordered the spicy chicken wings, and the chicken wings tasted like KFC which was kind of interesting. For my meal, I ordered the Thai Beef Salad which was much better than I was expecting. It was just what  I needed. My boyfriend ordered the Pad see ew and he said it was really good much much better than a lot of the other places we've tried. Will come here for all my thai cravings and really want to try some of the other things on the menu.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lunch here never disappoints. For less than 10 bucks, you can an entree of your choice, a side salad, and 2 cream cheese wontons!

They don't skimp you on portions and it's enough to even have leftovers. Service is great and food is even better. 

I've never had an issue with parking since the lot is so big, but there can be a lot of cars since its right next to a university.

*They don't tell you, but they also charge an additional $1.00 for substitute beef for chicken<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love love love the food. The environment is nice and clean. As for the service everyone is very attentive and fast.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A hidden gem in the corner of a strip mall.  I like the basil and beef. Nice decor and music and a friendly wait staff.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm a fan after coming here a couple of times now!  :)  Located by the 99 cent store and big lots, this is delicious and authentic Thai place!  The service is great.  They keep checking up on you and making sure your drinks are filled.  The staffs are really attentive and nice.


A few of my favorites:
*Combination appetizer (coconut shrimp, spring rolls, cream cheese wontons) - You'll enjoy this appetizer if you like it friend and crispy.  The coconut shrimp and the spring rolls was my favorite.  Didn't care too much for the cream cheese wontons.

*Yellow chicken curry - This was OK dish.  Nothing to glow about.  The chicken was on the dry side.  Bleh.

*Green chicken curry - This was a better curry dish.  A little bit spicy but goes well with the chicken and egg plant.

*Pad thai chicken - Love this pad thai!  A bit of sweetness.  The noodles was cooked well and smooth.  You can actually move your fork/chopsticks around within the noodles and not get tied up.  lol

*Spicy seafood fried rice (shrimp, squid, mussels, chili paste, onion, basil, Serrano) - This was a surprising and yummy dish for me.  Tasted better than I had expected!  A little bit spicy and not overpowering rest of the flavor and textures of the seafood.  The squid and mussels was delicious.  Loved switching eating between this dish and the Pad thai dish (for the sweetness).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was delicious! This little place really surprised me because I didn't know it was so nice on the inside and didn't expect much. The service was really fast and the servers were so nice and friendly. I thought it was a little pricey for what it was (everything on the menu is about $12.50 s plate) decently portioned and they have boba milk tea.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm giving 2 stars only because the people here are great and they welcome u with a nice smile. Other than that, nothing else...I used to come here very often but I haven't visited in a while since I moved out of Fullerton. I decided to visit today so I can get my favorite Combination Fried Rice but to my disappointment, the food wasn't as "combined" as it used to be. The rice was so moist and tasteless, looking so pale and unappetizing. I could barely find any shrimp (even though I requested for extra).  Maybe they changed the cook or something but please guys I'm begging you to "BRING BACK OUR RICE"!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I came in and ordered out this past Saturday. I ordered a pad thai and cream cheese wontons to take back home. I ordered the pad thai with tofu, no meat, because I don't eat meat and when I took it home, it didn't have any meat. So I was relieved in that aspect.
But unlike other thai places, the only vegetables on my noodles were bean sprouts, zucchini, and some green onions. Other places I've gone to have way more vegetables. The cream cheese wontons were pretty good.

About halfway through I spotted something black in my food- at first I thought it was a broken part of a fake nail, but upon closer inspection it looks like a shell of some sort- after a bit of googling I found out that it was a broken part of a mussel shell. Blegh. Don't eat seafood- again I'm a vegetarian. HUGE turnoff. I put the rest of the food away and put it in the fridge because I was so grossed out. This morning, my dad decided to eat the rest, and guess what? Found 3 more broken shell pieces in here.

Do mussels even go in seafood pad thai? I thought it was only shrimp. Either way, very gross. I'll be weary of any vegetarian pad thai I have from now on because this was just a weird and off-putting experience.

I will throw in a few pros: the atmosphere was nice, seemed clean. Also, the employees were very polite.

But the prices were a bit high when comparing to what you get too.

Won't be coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Me and a friend came here. First time, order the Tum Yum Soup with Chicken. And the Spicy Basil Chickem. Both absolutely amazing. Food came out very fresh and hot (just like me). Lmfao jk. Extremely delicious, perfectly spiced and made with love. Best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Definitely coming here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This restaurant is located in the corner of a plaza very close to Cal State Fullerton. It is run by Thai people. The customer service is great here. The employees here really pay attention to their customers, making sure to see when the customers are ready to order and to keep refilling the drinks. 

The lunch specials are about $10 and include salad and cream cheese wontons. The entree portions in the lunch special are smaller though so if you prefer to eat more of the entree, I would recommend just ordering directly from the menu items instead of the lunch specials that are located on the back of the menu. 

Pad kee mao with chicken was spicy enough to have a kick to it. It is a bit oily, but the chicken was made to perfection with it not being too dry. There was just the right amount of onions and red bell peppers to mix the flavors in the dish. Overall, the great customer service and the pad kee mao was decent enough for me to want to go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My daughter and I walked the CSUF campus and went to the bookstore. We got hungry so decided to try the Thai restaurant thailandia. It is really good. I got the drunken noodles, she got the pad Thai. Really delicious and spicy just how I like it. WAY better than Thai Basil across the street. I suggest Thailandia if you want friendly service and delicious food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chicken shrimp pad thai was horrible. The chicken had a weird taste to it and they only put 3 shrimp. Will not be coming back as it was pricey for the poor quality of food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quality: 3 - Your average Thai food.
Quantity: 2 - A bit less than what you would expect for price.
Service: 4 - Place is usually empty.

Thailandia offers of course... Thai food. Personally, I see the restaurant as an average restaurant. Good for eating dinner a bit later I suppose. All in all, there isn't a special factor differentiating this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is pretty good, not the best Thai around but not bad.  The service is terrible, everyone is so confused, slow paced and not really friendly.  I've given this place 3-4 visits and I'm pretty sure they just don't give an ish.  The wait for your food and finding parking is slightly painful.  There isn't much of an incentive to frequent this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in with my friends and the restaurants was kind of empty. We sat down and ordered. The coconut soup was absolutely delicious. Was not expecting it to be that good. We also got some other noodles which were really good. Service was excellent and the food. Best Thai place I've been to. Definitely recommend.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hmm..did I go on an off-day? I got the pad thai, and it was just bland. My friend also got the spring rolls, which were basically just egg rolls. We asked them about it, and they said this is their version of spring rolls. Okay. My friend ended up trying it and said they were one of the worst egg rolls she's ever eaten.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was not overly impressed with this place at all. I came at the end of the lunch crowd with a bunch of my coworkers and it just wasnt up to the standards I would expect for the area. Let alone for Thai food... what a scary thought... I have standards!

They provided a decent portion of everything. It was also nice to have the extras given with lunch even if off of the dinner menu. You know the salad and rice...

I ordered one of my favorites, garlic n pepper chicken. Unfortunately it didnt have much more beyond garlic and absolutely no sauce. Normally they sauté the chicken in garlic and spices and a bit of peppers, unfortunately that doesn't happen here. It was definitely not my idea of a good time and I dont plan to return.

All 6 of us (my coworkers remember) thought the food was underwhelming and not up to snuff. We all agreed that Thai Basil across the street or some of the other not to far off thai joints were much much better.

Additionally we were ordering some to-go grub. This presented many more problems. They didn't have our togo orders ready, in fact they chaged us for them but didn't make them... They flat-out forgot to make them... 

To make matters even worse, our check wrong was all wrong. So yeah don't come here unless you want some messed up crapola... straight up...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a solid choice for Thai food casual dining. The curries are great and the servers are super sweet. The ambiance is interesting with all of the tourism posters and videos and - for some reason - random balloons...some day I will have to ask about all of the balloons...

This place is usually less insane than Thai Basil across the street, which I appreciate. But the location isn't in the most romantic spot - next to the 99 cent store, goodwill, and big lots. (Great if you're out bargain shopping though!!). In any case, points for friendliness, consistency, solid curries, good prices.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Finding good Thai food is typically a challenge. Either its light on flavor or you have to drive a ways to get it. 

But thanks to fellow yelpers, I stumbled onto this gem in my backyard. Tucked away in the corner of a strip mall this place reminds of a restaurant my parents use to take us to decades ago. 

The owner is nice... she has no problem helping you through the menu. She helped me the first time I came in. The ambiance and decor is standard for your hole in the wall Asian restaurant. And the food here is tasty with just enough spice. Portions are a good size. I have yet to eat at the restaurant so I cannot speak to the service. But to-gos are easy and packed up well.

We usually go for the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, Spicy Seafood Fried Rice, Yellow Curry, Pad Thai and the Pad See Ew. Not all at once though...  3 dishes is perfect for 2 people. And you'll have plenty left for the next day.

Minus one star cause everything is just slightly on the pricey side. But value is there and I don't have to cross over to Rowland Heights for my Thai fix.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered the pad thai to go and it was pretty good. They make their pad thai sweet then most I've tried which made it delicious. Prices are kinda high but I'd come back to try their other dishes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My boyfriend and I love Thai food, we saw how great the reviews were on Yelp and decided to stop in. We had barely sat down and were handed menus when we were asked what we wanted to eat. Keep in mind we had barely gotten menus. When we replied no the waitress stomped off annoyed. This was only the beginning to the horrible customer service we recieved. The waitresses were rude and pushy. Although the food was delicious I don't think I'll be returning due to the horrible customer service I experienced. And add to that, the ice water tasted as if it were out of a toilet bowl.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really good food and great service... recommend to all people who like thai food !! 
the people are very happy to help you, the food comes right away with smiles and great flavors.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I normally trust Yelp when I see a place has 4 stars and I was sadly disappointed with my choice in trying Thailandia. The service wasn't bad they were friendly and attentive. We ordered the orange chicken and pad Thai and it came out in like 2 minutes I kid you not. Normally, quick service is a good thing but then you start to wonder what quality you are getting in food that is ready in minutes. Well, I can tell you for 25 bucks I would have much rather gotten Del taco(TBH I LOVE DEL TACO) . It just was not good I'm sorry. The pad Thai tasted like curry and the quality of meat was horrible. I expected a little more for the price I paid. I will not be coming back here and I would not recommend this place to anyone. It seems like any restaurant can get 4 stars nowadays or maybe the majority of people enjoy really crappy food? I don't get it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really nice and presented place for it being in a little tiny corner of a plaza. Almost hidden with so many yummy places surrounding it. My family and I decided to try it for the first time. Once everyone's food came out, we were all missing but one plate that was ordered. So we asked for it after about five minutes of realizing it wasn't going to come. The servers were pretty nice, not as genuine as they could be, but they were friendly. We each got different types of dishes and shared. The pad Thai was a little too sweet and not that flavorful. I don't know how you can mess up pad Thai, the most popular Thai dish. The rest of the food was tasty. I especially enjoyed my spicy noodles (other known as drunken noodles) I had tofu with it and I loved how cooked and firm they were. My cousin enjoyed how big her mussels in her seafood pad se ew was. 

The only reason I gave it a three star is because they forgot to give us one dish and at the end of getting the checks to pay, they tried to charge us twice for pad se ew that we only had gotten once! It was a confusion between the fact that my cousin who was waiting for her food told the waitress. And she put in the order again thinking we wanted it again. I was explaining the situation to the waitress, she was so adamant about the fact that we ordered it twice! And we kept insisting to her that we had only ordered it once and only reminded her that we did not get the pad se ew the first time. She totally thought we were lying when it was fully her own mistake. They then had to go back to the cook and confirm with them on how many plates they had cooked and of course he said one pad se ew. Thankfully she apologized because I was slightly irritated. We were not trying to steal no food, my momma taught me better! I don't like getting ripped off just as the next person! Well definitely not be coming back here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered the yellow curry chicken for take out tonight.  It was ok.  However, it wasn't anything to rave home about.  The flavor of the food was good, but not great.  I thought the prices were comparable to other Thai restaurants, and the serving a decent size.  There was some tofu with my chicken but that was ok for me.  

The lady who rang me up was very nice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down the best Thai food in Oc. Do not judge by the location or cheesy decor because this place takes the cake. I highly suggest the Pineapple Fried Rice, Shrimp Pad Thai, and Thai iced tea. Great leftovers and prompt and fast service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent food.  Get the vegetable coconut soup!!

Pad Thai full of flavor.  Curry not bad either.

Just avoid the shrimp!!  It tasted terrible.  Not even certain it was cooked.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The best chicken pad see ew I've ever had and I've had quite a few! Definitely will be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ever since Coconut Bay in Rowland Heights closed down, I've been on the hunt for a decent Thai place in the area. This place looked decently promising on Yelp, so I figured I'd give it a shot. 

We came here for dinner. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, but I'm not surprised...considering the location isn't exactly the greatest. The interior is fairly nice, new and relatively clean. Our servers seemed pretty nice, although there was clearly an apparent language barrier between us, as they could barely explain anything on the menu, nor take our order down correctly. After some struggling and pointing, we finally settled on the tom yum soup, green curry, chicken pad thai and seafood fried rice. The soup was definitely below average and kind of gross - it was sour and never fully heated up even in the traditional Thai pot, so we had to eat it lukewarm. The green curry had a very strong coconut flavor and was just a tad spicy, but the portion size was a bit disappointing. I like how the curry came with two giant shrimp chips, which were tasty and airy...but it's not a very good sign when the chips are the best part of the meal. Eek! The pad thai was completely unauthentic, as the bean sprouts came cooked (they're supposed to be raw), they added tofu to the dish, the noodles were overlooked, and there were no signs of crushed peanuts anywhere to be found. The soggy noodles came smothered in a sauce that tasted like something directly out of a can. The seafood fried rice was pretty good, albeit on the greasier side. It was also a bit disturbing how quickly the fried rice came out right after we ordered - kind of makes you wonder if it was pre-made or something. 

Overall, this place is a million times better than it's competitor, Thai Basil (located across the street). With that being said, it's not very hard to be better than that place, considering that place blows (see my review)! Prices are kind of on the higher end, considering the quality, taste and presentation of the food is all subpar. I would possibly come back, but only if I was desperate. I guess the hunt for a decent Thai restaurant in the area is still on...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The people who work here seemed very nice, and I'm sure that's why this place has 4 stars. I ordered the pad thai and was not impressed. To me it's over priced for mediocre food and I will not be returning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was decent but portions were very small for dinner size entries. Ordered seafood Pad Thai and chicken with basil. They gave one small scoop of rice with the chicken dish. There was barely enough food for both of us for the price. Common guys be a little generous!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not bad if your craving thai but not the best one around the area...shrimp pad thai is decent...thai basil chicken was good just wish there's more chicken than basil...friend noodle shrimp was Ok...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered pad Thai and Thai ice tea for take-out. Thai tea was awfully sweet and tastes instant made. Pad Thai was ok. No lunch specials on weekends.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place was our favorite local Thai spot but they're now under new management and while the food isn't bad, it's definitely not what it used to be. There's been small changes to the menu but the most significant change is the new chef. Dishes that were once 5 star are now 2.5/3 stars. Our entrees came out before our apps. Also of note: I found a hair in my food the last time we went. They took my plate and said they'd get me a fresh meal but it was gross and I always wonder if my food has really been re-made or just re-heated after removing the hair after something unhygienic like that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in here to order a beef spicy noodle. Ended up getting a chicken spicy noodle. The waitress changed my order for me and I asked her to make it mild. No big deal. The next plate that came out was half the size of a normal order and it was twice as spicy. I brought this up to the server and she just said. Ohhhhh I'm sorry. 

This is the second time that I've been here. The first time was OK but this visit caused this review. Just not acceptable in my opinion. The food is ok but if you can't get the order right,  what is the point?  10 dollars wasted. I can't even eat this and I'm Asian with a pretty good tolerance for spicy food. Lol.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yelp! You let me down...but I still love you cuz I know it's not your fault that this restaurant is surrounded by college kids who don't have a clue about what good Thai food is :-/  The only reason I came here was because of the 4 star rating and hours later, I'm still dumbfounded at how this place could ever get above 2 stars.

Allow me to elaborate...

My cousin and I both felt like getting some good Thai food...and being used to restaurants like Thai Bamboo and Thai Nakorn, we can appreciate good quality Thai food.  So we came here, soley based on Yelp ratings.

As we were deciding what to order, I mentioned that I'd like to share the shrimp Tom Kha soup, as that is my usual standard of measurement to base a good Thai food restaurant...that and Beef Panang.

So, we ordered the Tom Kha soup, Beef Panang and Shrimp Choo Chee.

And now the shit hits the fan:

First off...service here is horrible!  Get this...they gave me a dirty dish, took it back with our soup spoons and never came back with a replacement dish or spoons!

The first dish they brought out was my cousin's entrée...before bringing out the soup, they brought his damn entrée!

When they brought out the soup, I was too busy looking at it and wondering why it didn't look like every other Tom Kha soup I've had...that I forgot to remind our server to bring back the soup spoons and dish they took.  But anyways, It was really watered down looking...didn't seem to have hardly any coconut milk in it.  The flavor wasn't disgusting, but it was by far the worst Tom Kha I've ever had.  

I was very disappointed, to say the least.

When they dropped off my Beef Panang, it looked good at first and I was hoping that maybe this part of the meal would be the redemption that I was expecting from a 4-star Yelp rated restaurant.  

No joke...I thought there was one less stray dog roaming the streets of Fullerton after I took my first bite of the beef.  There's no way that was beef...the texture and flavor was terrible!  The curry wasn't too bad.

The icing on the cake...

They give a side salad with the entrée, which I thought was rather nice...until I looked inside my dressing and saw a big hair in it! Are you kidding me?! That was pretty much the last straw...when the waitress came by to drop off the check, I mentioned to her that she never came by to check on us and that I found a hair in my food.

She blamed her lack of hospitality on being too busy...which they were not really that busy, and the cherry on top of the icing...she told me that she thinks the hair was from my goatee! 

I could see the hair in my salad dressing from a distance and I didn't even get near the dressing prior to that discovery...and my cousin and I are BALD!! She just laughed it off and walked away...no empathy or compensation.

We literally left half our food on the table, paid the ridiculous price for that garbage and even left a 15% tip!!

I took the time to write this review because this restaurant does not deserve 4 stars...not even close.

Horrible service, terrible food quality...but, one thing they did do right was the presentation of the food and their Thai ice tea was the best thing I had there.  Although, as you can tell...that ain't saying much!

I haven't tried Thai Basil...but I can't imagine it being any worse than this.

I hope this review was helpful!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really like the food here. Friendly service and they serve you quickly, especially if you are on your lunch break. They have lunch specials but limited plates. I spent about $15 by myself including tip. Will definitely come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was in fullerton to visit my cousins and was feeling thai food. This place was delicious. Ordered pad sew, pad thai and chicken curry all were fantastiic must try... will definitely be back when im in town..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I prefer this Thai restaurant over the one across the street. They have better service. Most of their side items come with white rice so you don't need to order any additional rice. Pretty good food. Seafood Tom Yum is my fave. Oh and I asked if they had garlic beef, I guess it's not on the menu but they still made it for me. Two thumbs up for making your customers happy! I'll definitely be coming here for my Thai food. Just make sure you look ahead at their store hours because they close midday to feed their staff. We all have to have our lunches sometime, it's understandable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So, I originally found this place on Yelp when my daughter was craving Thai food after a long medical appointment. In reading all of the 5 star reviews, I have to admit I was skeptical. I thought, "There is no way this place is as good as all of these people claim. These reviews have to be fake!". 

Boy was I wrong!! The food here is unbelievably good! There are no words that can accurately describe the amazing flavors I experienced when dining here.  I hope you have the pleasure of experiencing the out of this world food for yourself!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is literally the only place I can eat Thai food from ever. 
My boyfriend and I come in about once a week, yes their food is THAT good.
We have tried the green curry dish, pad thai, pad see ew, tom yum soup, orange chicken, crab fried rice, and tom kah kai soup. Each and every dish is so full of flavor. 
Their service is awesome and the food comes out incredibly fast.
And the prices are totally reasonable!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I wouldn't give higher rate due to the service and the taste of the food.
1. Services. When we  asked for checks it took them a long while to get eye contact with us. They tried to avoid eye contact with customers ( I won't recommended this restaurant for regular dinning.)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of the best Thai restaurants in Fullerton! Pad Thai is the best dish to get in my opinion<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The good is so good and flavorful!! Their price is somewhat reasonable. I love the place looks and the service is great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst Customer Service ever! The waitress tried to charge me for a regular meal when I ordered a lunch special and when I pointed this out on my receipt, she gave me major attitude and told me "well, your portion was big". Who responds like that?? Terrible! Never coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place! It was recommended to me by a friend who lived in Thailand. The food is very authentic (according to him) but very delicious even if it isn't. 

I always get the Pad-See-Ew. It's delicious. The Panang curry is nice and spicy which is how I like it. 

I recommend that you eat in if you can. The food is better when it comes straight out of the kitchen nice and warm.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came in for dinner at about 5:00 pm on a weekday and it was pretty empty. Overall, the service was good. I ordered the green chicken curry. It had a good amount of heat, but it was bland and watery in consistency. Not sure if I'd come back, but if I do, I'd try something else.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pros: Staff is great, the place is clean

Cons: Tom Kai Gai (coconut soup) was watery and thin, and missing the coconut milk, we asked for mild and it came out spicy.  Ordered Pad Thai and it was missing the peanuts (no biggie, but it is a national dish).

In the corner of a strip mall, apparently the lunch crowd is huge.  Overall, great staff but there are plenty of other Thai places....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Restaurant closes at 10. It is 9:30 so they will not seat us and will only take To-Go orders.  This is what I call lazy service.  If your restaurant is open until 10 then you should abide by your hours listed or state this on Yelp. They are denying people because they just don't want people staying too late for their convenience<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wouldn't serve me because I came 30 minutes before they closed...  And would only provide to go. Ok, maybe change your hours then?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here Wednesday night, was going to Pho next door but they closed already. Ordered Tom Yum and Pad Thai and spicy basil seafood. All very good.
And it's only 5 min from my house lol.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was delicious. I recommend this Thai restaurant. I would return to this place for some Thai food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was visiting Fullerton for a conference. Went to Thailandia because of the Yelp reviews, and it was a poor experience from the beginning. The restaurant was an oven and they didn't run the AC while it was 99 degrees outside. We ordered pad thai and yellow curry, and found a long metal object in the pad Thai. The waitress apologized and quickly went on to say that she would not be able to remove the item from the bill. Horrible experience, food was mediocre and poor customer service! Do not go here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is alright but a little pricey for its portion  and ok quality. Service was alright..there were only 2 person so it was hard to get help but when they did help, they were nice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nice, friendly service, the food came out pretty quick too.  Great Pad Thai and Pad See Ewe!!  Will definitely be back for more when I'm in the area!

The thai iced tea had way too much half and half/mocha mix in it.  And the tap water was icky.  I'm just going to get Singha next time :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here a couple of times and they always have a new balloon tower near the front of the restaurant. I guess they really like balloons. Anyways, I happen to be a self renowned pad thai whisper!! After years of defining my pallet for the very best pad thai, I will give thailandia an honest grade of B+. Pretty good by my standards. A pad thai that doesnt clump altogether, isnt too dry and not too sweet is what youll get. They do leave out the peanuts and lime which is odd, but i suppose they have complete confidence in their product. It actually tastes, looks and feels like what pad thai should be. 
The overall experience of thailandia is superb, the motif of the atmosphere makes you actually believe you're getting a quality meal from Thailand. My first rule for restaurants is cleanliness and they get an A in my book for that. The menu is short and easy to navigate, it's better to have a handful of really good dishes than an abundance of so so dishes. I recommend the Tom Yum soup if you don't mind the sour taste, but I promise you will not be disappointed. I throw in some jalapeños because I like the additional spice. Thai food is also well known for their curry, unfortunately I'm not a huge curry guy so I'm not the right person to get advice from for that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OMG!!!

This is the worst Thai restaurant I have for years!!! 
Now, I know why the other Thai restaurant close by is so popular!!!
I asked them why every food is so damn sweet? 
They told me I should tell them to make it normal before I order.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We were in the area and my mom was craving Thai food and Yelp led me here....there really aren't a ton of Thai places in the area and this one was the higest rated so I thought it would be a sure bet...I've never really had BAD Thai food, it's all the same to me, but my mom was disappointed with this place.

It's in a small and kind of seedy shopping center on Chapman, tucked into the corner. Once you walk in, it's way nicer and much bigger than the Thai places I frequent. We snagged a booth and scanned the menu, pretty standard/everything you'd expect, maybe slightly more pricey than average or at least more than what I'm accustomed to, but overall not bad. 

I ordered the most vanilla thing ever, Chicken Pad Tai and my mom had Spicy Yellow Thai Curry. Mine was good, not insanely so, but pretty much just tasted the same as it always does. My mom commented that there was a lot of tofu in hers and not a lot of veggies...it's true, I saw a lot of potato and tofu and only like two carrots, the flavor was good to me, but she just didn't seem impressed.

The service was quick and friendly and the good was average, I wouldn't say I'd return here but I certainly wouldn't sway anyone from NOT coming here...it was perfectly adequate and not an inch more.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is so yummy! So much better than thai basil across the street. I'd recommend their boba thai tea .. The menu said its "world famous," lol & I WOULD totally believe that because it's so good! I've tried their green curry, spicy basil chicken, pad thai, and tom yum soup.. All of them were superb! Their service is always excellent as well, the waiters and waitresses are always so kind and polite (but maybe it's a thai thing..lol ). Every time I crave thai food (which is quite often) I would come here since I only live a few blocks down! Thailandia deserves five stars all the way!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Craved Thai food and found this place nearby via Yelp! The decor inside is a little strange, but it was pretty good. They claim in their menu that they have world famous Thai iced tea and it was pretty good, though I don't know about world famous. We ordered pad thai and shrimp friend rice. Pad Thai was good and they add tofu which I liked. The shrimp fried rice was good, but it was a bit too oily. Service wise everyone was really nice and attentive!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'll come here if I'm REALLY craving Thai food and don't want to make the drive all the way to Rowland heights. The lunch specials are cheaper than Thai Basil which is across the street, but the food is just OK. I'll go here if I'm desperate though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great Thai food in a clean, cozy location. I loved my Eggplant Basil withShrimp. Ordered medium spicy and it was just right. Hubby's Green Curry Shrimp was also delicious. Great friendly service. An easy walk from the Marriott. I'll go back soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been ordering from here for a couple of years now. I usually order for pickup and it takes about 20 minutes for my order to be ready.

I like the pad see ew with beef and the crab fried rice. 

The pad see ew beef recipe changed recently for some reason. For some reason they started putting in bean sprouts, which I don't like that much. Other than that it's great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Incredible Panang Curry (heat level 3) the chicken was super tender and the basil was super fresh. I would be a regular if I lived nearby.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">PROS
Clean interior
Friendly


CONS
Parking is a headache in this strip mall
Some dishes are inconsistent depending on the day

Food is hit or miss. Yet I continue to go back when I am in the area because the service is good and the place is clean.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

Is the music playing in your head yet? It should be...

Let me say that I really wanted to like this place and it pains me to have to ding a local, family owned business. I'm going to give them a second chance some other time but so far, I was less than impressed. 

THE GOOD :

The place is very clean. In fact, I came in close to closing and everyone was busy cleaning. This, I thought, was a good sign. I was wrong. 

The service was good as well. The waitress and owner checked on me during my meal and they were helpful in explaining the menu selections. 

The Bad : 

I ordered the spicy chicken wings because they looked like they would be super-tasty. Unfortunately, they were overcooked, well beyond golden brown, and pretty well dried out. Somebody wasn't paying attention at the fryer. If you compare the picture someone posted here on Yelp to the picture Thilandia has posted on its website, you'll see what I'm talking about. The accompanying sauce was delicious. 

The Ugly : 

On the owners suggestion, I ordered Pad See-Ew which are stir fried flat rice noodles. The noodles were fine, the vegetables were properly done and the presentation was good. The beef, however, was once again, well overcooked and really tasteless. 

This place has potential and I've heard that different family members run the place from time to time. If they could improve some of their cooking techniques and maybe the quality of their beef, the place could be a nice place to visit. The interior is slightly upscale and the kind of place you could take a date. 

Look for a new review in the future.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have actually never signed in to my account to write a review in years.  I'm specifically writing this today to release my frustration.  I made a phone order under my name and my mom said she was going to pick it up for me. When she went in they asked the name for the order and she gave my name. They mixed up my order.  I had to go all the way back to get it changed back.  They used the same order that I brought back and saved it to give it to the correct person.  What of the person returning it touched the food?!  They are just gonna give it back to them? And they didn't have the courtesy to apologize.  The owner didn't even genuinely apologize for wasting my time...  

I have been to this place for a quite a while now and I expected them to be more professional, nicer, and cleaner.  

This might seem dramatic but I am the one paying for the food and I had to go back to get it.  And what of my food was too he'd and returned by a random stranger too.  Ugh not going again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm giving Thailandia 5 stars for the dishes I get! The spicy basil chicken, pad see ew, and red curry are AMAZING! The Thai iced tea is really good, too. 

I wish they delivered! I would seriously eat their food every day. 

DELICIOUS!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is absolutely amazing, the best Thai food I have ever had. The chicken fried rice was so delicious. Very friendly and attentive staff. Clean and modern decor. A must try!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Appetizers: Chicken wings, spring rolls (fried) 
Both were very good. Spring rolls must have been right out of the fryer cuz it was HOT.

Main Dishes: Pad Thai (shrimp), Pad See Eww (beef), crab fried rice
Everything was good and I'm glad to see real crab in the fried rice. Cooks should be ashamed using imitation crab meat. 

Each was delicious and if I was in the area I'd come back here. We came on a Tuesday and it got crowded after 7pm.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Why is this place so delicious!!!!!???!?! We started off with the crab rangoon cream cheese wonton things.. mmmmmmmm. 

Next... we ordered the tom kuh kai. It's a coconut soup, and a delicious one at that!!! My mouth has never experienced anything like it. Its spicy and so tasty. It was filled with mushrooms, chicken, and a dash of magic. 

Lastly, we had pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp. This dish was a delight as well. I spruced mine up with all that chili sauce they give you. 

Tom kuh kai. Yes please.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decent and tasty food for a reasonable price and plenty if Parking.
Have to try the summer salad with a sting of spic.
Will repeat ...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I walked in for a quick dinner after a hike all dirty in gym clothes. And looked around; everyone was dressed nice. Looked like everyone had just got off work and went there for dinner. Seemed like a good sign. The waitress was very nice and upbeat, also had a loud voice which was good because there was music playing in the restaurant. The things I usually order at a Thai restaurant didn't look  good there based off the pictures  (pad-see-ew and drunken noodles). So I decided to go with one of their signature dishes in the back of the menu. And boy did I regret doubting them!!! I got the Spicey bamboo chicken and it was amazing with so much flavor!! They give you a lot of food and seperate the rice and main dish which is cool. The very best part and I'm sure ppl can relate was that their chicken was so tender and perfectly cooked unlike other Thai restaurants who over cook their chicken or use chicken that's not of high quality. They also serve you with a small greens salad. I hate dressing and it was nice that they automatically put it on the side for you. Overall this place was honestly expensive.....But very worth it for the overall quality of food and attentiveness by the ppl that work there. Enjoyed it, I WAS VIBIN'<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yelpers are really starting to let me down in terms of food around the fullerton area  =( .  At the time of the review, this place has 4.5 stars.  

While the restaurant is pretty clean and modern looking for a Thai restaurant, the service was painfully slow and the food was mediocre at best.  The pad thai we ordered had so much sauce on it that it turned into a sweet and sour wet mess of noodles.  I was hoping for some redemption in the catfish dish, but while the quantity of it was pretty good, the catfish was burned to a crisp.  I felt like I was eating fried beef jerky.  Turn fish into jerky and you know you've got a problem.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back.  

2 stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thailandia has really tastey Pad Thai for a good price(around $11 fort plate that seems never ending) and with polite and friendly customer service. This combination of features has made Thailandia my go-to place for some good Pad Thai. Every time I go I vary between different levels of spiciness and have enjoy them all. They offer red peppers and spices on the side too to really add a kick to the dish. It's extremely satisfying. Haven't tried any of the curries yet but their Pad Thai is definitely a solid dish.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Never have i ever had such delicious flavorful curry and pad thai! 
and there Thai tea is to die for!
the service is spectacular, just like their food.
they deserve all the awards!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't: Say you're open until ten on yelp if you close at 9:40. This is 2014. If you're going to do last call, post THAT as your closing time. I work in the business so don't try to say anything sideways about slower business levels or off days. 

Do: Apologize if a first time diner walks in at 9:40 and you say you're closed.

Don't: Smile awkwardly as aforementioned first time diner tells you he's never been here and will never return as a result of your technological shortcomings. 

For potential diners:

Do: Just go across the street to Thai Basil


And no, I'm not just hangry. That's bad business practices.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My family and I love getting their Tom Kha (Thai coconut) soup to-go because it's perfect with rice! They know how to make the soup to perfection! It has the perfect amount of chicken, mushroom, and spice! Occasionally, we come to dine in. Every time we eat here, we're greeted with friendly and smiling staff. They have great lunch specials and their entrees are perfect to share. Might I add that every food entree I've tried here is delicious, such as the satay beef skewers! Sometimes I come in just to buy their Thai tea because it's made with the right amount of sweetness.

I definitely recommend this place over Thai Basil. It feels more spacious, the staff is super friendly and chill, and the food is amazing! You can't expect more from a lovely Thai restaurant in Fullerton. It can look a little sketchy from the outside because it's kind of hidden in a corner, but don't worry, it's definitely worth the trip!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great thai food.  I loved the green curry and the beef on the beef salad was tender and had a lot of flavor. Can't get enough of the red chili sauce. Too bad they don't have thai iced coffee, my favorite. They have a mocha coffee which is good but it's not thai iced coffee.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'll edit this review a little since I tried the other menus. 
We used to always order the Mongolian beef (it's not on the menu anymore, but it's so good) to go, but we dined in for the first time the other day, and ordered Pad tai chicken and Chicken with cashews.
The Pad tai was ok but too sweet and tasted like ketchup so it wasn't my favorite. 
Chicken with cashews were really good! I loved it. Nicely spicy and flavorful.

Oh, and their boba was way too sweet so I'll never order it here.

It's like 3.5stars for me so far but I would like to keep coming back and try the other foods since the location is perfect for me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It was OKAYY. I was upset at the portion, but I thought, "food might be great!" Food was good, wasn't great. Anyone who had authentic Thai food would know great. 10 bucks for my tiny green curry that barely had any soup. My friend had likes it, tho. I think Sweetie Thai or LONG BEACH THAI is better, if you really crave Thai food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thailandia is a great place for some Thai food! The food is delicious and the workers are kind people. At times, the service may not be great but it's nothing to stop us from going there again. I'm sure they're trying their best. Overall, I love this place! The Pad Thai is authentic and the Pad See Ew is worth the try! Thailandia gets two thumbs up from this guy !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am on a pretty strict paleo diet but once in awhile I indulge myself on a cheat day which I take pretty seriously. I was craving Thai so decided to try this place out for the first time based on the pretty good reviews. 

Yelp, you led me astray. 

NOTHING sucks worse than wasting calories on bad food. How they managed to make the food super salty and over sweet but lacking in flavor at the same time is pretty amazing. Even my love thirst for carbs wasn't enough for me to finish the food - and that's really saying a lot. The best thing about this place was the Thai iced tea which was mediocre at best.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Today was my second time coming here, ill start by saying that i love Thai food and i have gone to several places but mostly in LA/southbay area. 

Thailandia is a small, nice, affordable restaurant, very close to CSUF reason why i went. I was debating between this place and Thai Basil but then i read some negative reviews on yelp about Thai basil so i decided to stick to what i know is good... thailandia! ( eventually ill go to t.b and see for myself if it is any good). I went during lunch... GO DURING LUNCH! huge portions ( ill post a picture) for only like 8 bucks. 

I got the pad thai chicken, very tasty! i couldn't finish it 
all so ill have the rest later... oh! It came with tofu! =)
It came with cream cheese wontons and salad, 
love the dressing! Service was great! nice/friendly ladies.It is usually slow so if you want a not so crowded/loud place, this is the place to go! i like eating peacefully at times. Give them a try!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yum! A nice place to take the family. It's reasonably priced and the food is really good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been coming here every so often and the food was mediocre while servers were friendly. If I was in the area and craving some Thai food, I would not mind stopping by to get a bite to eat....BUT I ordered some pad thai and green curry today and the pad thai was really bland. I think they may have changed chefs as the pad thai is usually good, but it was exceptionally bland and the color was dull. I have eaten lots of pad thai at many different restaurants and I can safely say it was the worst pad thai I have ever experienced. I will stop by a few months later to check it out again and will adjust the rating accordingly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">+Very good food!
+Reasonably priced.
+Delicious Pad Thai noodles!
+I don't know what was with the inflatable monkey though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This restaurant is hands down the best service and food in the area. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. The food was delicious and had very authentic favors prepared by great cooks. Even after our food was dropped off, the staff was very passionate about making sure our food came out and lived up to our expectations (btw, I'm Thai and the food did live up to what I expected). 

I definitely recommend this establishment to everyone and encourage to utilize their friendly staff and great environment for any event you may be planning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great, friendly, & quick service, not to mention the food, amazing! The price was relatively cheap as well . I'm very impressed & will definitely come back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to Thailandia about five times now and I've never had a bad dish here. Last night, I tried two new delicious entrees; the chop chee shrimp and chili chicken. Plus my old standby the combination fried rice is as yummy as always and instead of my usual iced tea, I had the ice coffee and it rocked! Service is excellent. Can't wait to return!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After a hard days work, driving up the 57. No urge to cook. Where do I go?  I quickly do a "nearby" on Yelp and this place pops up.  Nice.  Spicy food sounds good right now.  And lookity here, 4-star rating.  

Drove into this strip mall...hmmmm. Okay, location isn't the most important.  Walked in and asked for a menu to order to go.  

Spicy Papaya Salad.  Yum!  Oh, it's got shrimp...doesn't sound good.  Can I have it without?  Just add more papaya, please.  Oh and my favorite spicy Pad See Ewe..make it beef please.

That'll be $19.  Wow, that's a lot, but okay.  I'm sure it tastes great.

Sorry folks, not coming back.  The size of the papaya salad was small compared to Thai Spice, and TS charges $6.45!  The Pad See-Ewe was not bad.  Portion are big.  But the flavor was dissapointing.  Not enough of anything really.  Couldn't taste the rich flavor of the oyster sauce and fish sauce.  You could taste the soy sauce, but that was it.  They also served it with brocolli.  Very little egg and no mushroom.  I know that's not traditional, but Thai Spice does and I love it in it.  The Pad See-Ewe was $8.60 compated to $6.95. 

Overall, disappointed.  Thai Spice it is.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very Nice place! Clean , quiet , good food! Outstanding service!! We will definitely be back!  They have a good  variety of plates and drinks. Totally recommend it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">U have to Thai this place! 
Best Pad See Ewe I've ever had! 
Amazing Sticky Rice and green tea ice cream!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Have been to this little restaurant many times and always have a very tasty meal.  Love the curries and the soups. My husband always gets the Kung Pao Chicken and he likes it a lot.  My favorite dish is probably the Pad-See-Ew - very yummy!  Service is also very good!  If you like Thai food, I highly recommend you give this place a try.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food might be good but the service is lousy. 

I ordered pad see ew, no meat and extra egg. When I got home, I saw it was pad thai. I came back to the restaurant to get the item fixed and went back and forth with now two servers (could be owner, I honestly don't know) and got it straighted out. They replaced it quickly. 

What bothers me is the interaction as I was walking out. One of the servers followed me out to tell me that next time they'll charge me extra egg... 

I'm sorry, your restaurant screwed up my order and I had to drive back and fix it but you're going to follow me out to tell me that you're planning to charge me extra? I've worked in the industry for several years as a supervisor and my guest would have gotten their money back and an appetizer or dessert for their time wasted, not followed out to be told they'd be charged extra.

 I will not be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We've gone here a few time and food is always good, but I wished that they had a larger menu.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food that is prepared now is not what it was a few months ago. My favorite dish here was the spicy basil chicken. Today when I ordered it, I was very disappointed.  They completely changed how the dish is made. They don't use ground chicken and there's no fried egg. You would think they would update their menu description but they didn't. I called to tell them that the dish wasn't like what I had before and the waitress told me that I had ordered kung pao chicken. After arguing with her for a few minutes,  she finally tells me that they make the dish differently. I'm just annoyed about how she couldn't get her story straight.  I am not going to eat here again. It's too expensive and the service isn't great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Formerly Pad Thai Corner, formerly Thai-Rama BBQ, Thailandia is proving that the 3rd time is always a charm. Either they've cleaned up their act or I've forgotten what great Thai food tastes like.

SERVICE
Like a glove. It's like they're giving away glasses of water. Yeah, I know it's free, but they came to my table like it was their mission to make sure my cup was full. With two servers working that afternoon, both came at least twice to ask me if I needed anything. Goes to show that when it's less busy, you receive a lot more attention.

ATMOSPHERE
Remodeled and clean to the core. They even had their grand opening flowers and plants still intact. The artwork has changed while the interior has a nice shine along with complimentary colors. Makes you wanna come "Back For More" - Five Finger Death Punch.

FOOD
Ordered the:

Beef Pad See Ew - Flat noodles prepared to perfection and not overcooked as they usually are from other places. One suggestion, add more broccoli please!

Thai Yellow Curry - I never order curry at Thai restaurants. Yet, I loved it! The curry was not heavy, with no stringent smell, and maintained a very clean taste. How clean? I took the leftover home and ate the chicken, potatoes, and carrots sans curry.

Chicken Noodles - It's not on the menu, but I ordered it like I was dining at the Original Thai BBQ restaurant. They made it with white meat chicken, bean sprouts, green onions, and just the right amount of oil. I rummaged through the noodles for some fried egg with no luck. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. One recommendation, sprinkle a little soy sauce over each serving.

Thai Iced Tea - 9 out of 10. Not extremely sweet as I expected it to be. Just the right flavor. I never add boba and usually ask for more ice. With this beverage, colder tastes better.

GRADE - 4 stars
At least for now, since I'll one up mushroom to 5 stars accordingly. All in all, one of my favorite Thai restaurants in OC. A great place to phone ahead and order to go. Check out their menu, cause the real Judge Dredd is you (http://www.thailandiausa...).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just moved to Fullerton and was looking for a great Thai place. My husband found them on yelp and thought we give them a try. Glad we did, Delious. They're Boba tea is great too. We will be eating here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What a pleasant surprise! I had to meet a friend in Fullerton and having gotten tired of Downtown Fullerton, I yelped Thailandia. It's located in a shopping center with 99 cent store, hidden in a corner. Upon entering the somewhat empty parking lot, I had a feeling this would be a hidden gem. Inside it's clean and the staff was friendly. I ordered the Veg Pad Thai and finished my entire plate! Best part the bill for two people came out to $15! 

Good food, great prices and not crowded location. Definitely give it a try!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great for lunch! the only thing is that if you are paying with your card there is a $10 minimum.  So i asked for iced thai coffee to make the bill $10+ but they had a little more than half a glass of iced coffee left  so they gave it to me for free and made a exception for the $10 minimum.  I will be going back for lunch most definitely!
 The lunch special comes with a salad, rice and two fried wontons and of course the main dish! The pad thai had tofu, egg and chicken which was amazing not too over the top greasy.  I cant wait to try their peanut sauce and curry next time!

Ohh yeah and its in the corner of a janky shopping center, don't let that fool you.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The response from this place is a joke.  I have had several phone conversations and even visited the restaurant days prior and there was ABSOLUTELY no mention of  any deposit for 15! adults and 2 children.  In fact I have spoken to staff for suggestions and was told to order 12 to 13 dishes.  We tried to compromise with the orders and added a few more, but when you call the NIGHT BEFORE  the reservation DEMANDING that we order more food than our entire party, and stick to our faces that you have to run a business during DOWN TIME, then you just completely disregarded professionalism.  Do not juggle our statements, you know you were wrong, this is one review.  If you cannot take negative reviews that your service is bad, then do better.  That is all there is to it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been going to this place for a few years. It used to be called thai bbq, but food is just as great. Prices are reasonable. Location is great..service is also good. My go to for thai food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They've changed the menu. The price has gone up but the food portion and quality are no longer as same as before. Highly recommend Thai Basil located nearby in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So refreshing to actually have good service in so-cal without having to pay an arm and a leg for crap food. The food here was great we got the chicken yellow curry and the thai pineapple fried rice with he spring rolls as appetizers. I would have given the food 4 stars and the service 10 stars if I could. The servers were so nice they gave us extra rice to take home because we boxed our leftover curry. They even offered to put our thai iced tea in a to go cup.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review is like me: short & sweet.

Service is good. The servers are very nice! Food is great! (They're stingy with their ice though)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very good Thai food. The new owner has figured things out finally. Food quality recently seems to have improved. Prices are fair. We enjoy the place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very good Thai food. I usually order the pad Thai. I think this place is much better than the place across the street, and you get better portions, too. The only thing I don't like about this place is that they have canned soda only, and one of my friends is a big sofa drinker, so we weren't happy about not getting refills.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I hate to give this place 2 stars because the service was so friendly. But I have to review the food, which was definitely sub par. 

The pad Thai with shrimp was rubbery and the shrimp were dry and over cooked. No Thai ice coffee is a bummer too.

They don't take American Express which makes a working lunch difficult.

I can't say that I'll be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yum yum tasty!!! :) :) 3.5 stars. Took my sister here after a long day of helping her move to Fullerton. She found this place on yelp and it lived up to the reviews! The service started out a little slow,  we walked in,  not too busy and the servers were at the back of the restaurant behind the counter.  They saw us walk in but didn't come over to greet or seat us. We probably stood around for 5 minutes before we sat ourselves down. Afterwards,  the waitress brought over the menus and from there,  the waitress was very attentive and service was fast.  

We got the chicken pad Thai and Tom yum soup. The pad Thai was hot and cooked to order and the noodles were perfect! Not overcooked or soggy and the flavor was on point! The Tom yum soup was hot yet light and refreshing and had big tasty shrimp, again, which was not overcooked. Minus one star for running out of coconut milk so I couldn't get the Tom Kha soup that the other yelpers were raving about. But u will try to go back another day for it! !

Overall,  not a bad choice :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been coming to this restaurant even before they were called Thailandia. They used to be Thai-rama. Back then and until now, the food has always been flavorful and the prices are reasonable. We consider this place one of our "go to" Thai places in the area. 

I am taking off one star because the place could use some updating and the service could be a little better. The staff here tend to forget about refills and checking in on you every once in a while...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been coming here for the past two years and I cannot recommend it enough! The staff is always friendly, I have sat here for four hours or more, even right before closing, and they have never failed to treat my friends and I courteously. The food is FANTASTIC, and I spent three years in Singapore and Thailand so I know they have their stuff together. My favorites are:
-Pad Thai
-Tom Kha Gai
-cream cheese wontons
-green and red curry
-Thai tea
-any other noodle dish. ANY.

As a previous student at CSUF, their lunch specials were super affordable and have lots of food for a great price. My husband and I make the drive whenever we can :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Something unexpected in Fullerton is that you have two Thai restaurants literally across the street from one another.  In one shopping center, there is the stalwart, Thai Basil which has a devoted following.  It is ok Thai food.

Then across the street there is Thailandia.  I was a bit curious to see how they compared.  After trying one meal here, I declare a Thai-breaker. They are a bit better than Thai Basil by about a half a star.  Their quality is certainly better.  We ordered the beef pad see ew, spicy beef salad, and beef larb.  Decent quality beef and the little salads that are plated with the dishes are mixed greens rather than the cheap iceberg lettuce kind.  They do go a little heavy on the fish sauce here though. Not so much that it ruins the dish, buts adds a level of pungency.  

A big difference is that their service here is much better.  Staff is friendlier and not as abrupt.  

I will probably be coming here more and trying some more of their dishes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pricing: Food is priced relatively well, not too expensive or inexpensive for what they provide

Taste: Tried the Shrimp Pad Thai, Combination Fried Rice, and Pad See-Ew. The food was salty but the flavors were on point. Definitely excellent food with fresh ingredients 

Presentation. The food looked like it tasted. Plenty of colors and well prepared. 

Portions. Portions are family style so you get a good amount of food. We were able to eat plenty and also had plenty of food to go. 

Ambiance: inviting and friendly atmosphere. 

Staff: The servers were friendly and very helpful

I will definitely return because the experience was great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just OK. Might come back but probably not. Service was not very good for a slow night. The pad Thai and pad se eew were just average. Much better Thai places in OC<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've eaten here many times before in the past and after seeing the flurry of reviews that we're ether 5 stars or 2 I was curious to see if the quality had really changed or if people just liked to complain for silly reasons.

We tried 2 of my staple meals with a friend and a 3rd after a recommendation not to try it by a negative review ( out of curiosity)  

We decided that everything was pretty darn good.

So let break it down dish by dish.

Pad Thai chicken- fairly standard dish. There was really nothing to complain about. It comes standard non spicy with a slight orange hue to hit. Throw some spice from the spice rack on and it becomes even tastier. 

Tom kha Kai- this is the coconut milk chicken soup. One thing I love about the sweet sour flavor is the little mushrooms that pop. Unfortunately I bit into this hard ginger or maybe taro thing in my bowl so watch out for it.

Orange chicken- (this was the bad review dish) I don't know what they were complaining about. I thought it was pretty tasty and the chicken has this crispy crunch that other places don't have. Most faux Chinese (Panda Express cough cough) orange chicken has a soggy consistency. So the crispy crunch was rather refreshing.

Overall I was quite satisfied with my dishes. The service was standard as far as restaurants go.

I'll probably be coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not bad.  Quality authentic Thai food and a reasonable price. Fresh and generous portions as well.  Ordered to go and food was ready at pick up as promised.  I'll go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Stopped by here on my way to work hoping for a bomb Thai iced Tea and YES! they have it.  It was $2.70 But wasn't very big.  Probably a 20 oz to go cup.  Guess I needed the Big Gulp that day. Lol. I'll be back here to try the food soon!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">so surprised at this little spot
in the middle of nowhere
bestie and i came here after a spa day
split spicy basil noodles with tofu
and a papaya salad
portions are large and flavors were on point
delicious and under $20!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great lunch specials! You can get a huge portion of Pad Thai with salad and cream cheese wontons for only 8.50.    The service is a little slow, but I believe that's because we came during lunch hour and there were many customers.  In any event, the servers were friendly and the food was delicious.   Definitely a must try if you're looking for a new lunch spot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">this has been my go-to thai place since moving to the area. they are always polite and the food is delicious. this is how much i enjoy them. last night i ordered some pad see ew and tom yung kung soup to-go. usually takes about 15-20 min. when i go there, the food was ready and the staff polite. there were a few diners even at 940pm (they close at 10pm). i got home ready to eat and was so disappointed. they totally forgot any sauce on the pad see ew! how do you even do that? it was just plain noodles and broccoli. i mean...i ate it since i was very hungry but the point is, i'd still go back to them. i have ordered and dined in quite a few times with them and never messed up an order. they tend to get really busy weekends and nights so be prepared to wait. the service tends to be really slow but they are still very polite.

i've had:

veggie egg rolls-simple and perfect everytime.
shrimp rolls-good but i've had better at my long beach thai place.

spicy basil eggplant-yummmmy!
pad thai-decent
pad see ew-not sure but i think when i've tried it with the sauce, it was actually quite delicious.
pineapple fried rice-yums
tom yung kung-i can have this for days
mongolian beef-delicious

i'm sure i've tried several other dishes and they were all delicious. it will continue to be my go-to thai place while i'm still in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I liked this place. The coconut soup was great and it had a perfect amount of spice and flavor. We also had the eggplant dish, kung pao chicken and shrimp pad thai. Everything was good, we left very full and pleased with our meal!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If u know Thai food, I wouldn't particularly recommend this place. The plate I ordered had way too much sauce that was heavily spiced and overwhelmed the entire dish. Taste of garlic was so strongly present that I couldn't taste any of the vegetables. Tofu (specially) and veggies did not look fresh or were not properly prepared. The cold cucumber does not belong in a hot dish, and I can keep on going. The service was friendly, fast and prompt. I asked for vegetarian and it seemed like the menu did not have much in the way of vegetarian dishes, she was a bit taken back. I don't get it! Restaurants use veggies for their other dishes, what does it take to put few well prepared vegetarian dishes in the menu?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I signed up for Yelp only to leave positive reviews. Well I had to break that code today. I had the most unappetizing Thai meal I've ever had. Other than my cousin receiving dirty dishes and hair in his salad dressing the food itself was practically inedible. I got a shrimp dish that was mediocre at best. The dish itself was luke warm and the shrimp tasted like scented flowers. The soup we ordered was so off what I am used to getting I took two bites and wasted the pot of shrimp soup. The best part was the white rice and soda. So disappointed by our experience and the fact that I had to leave a negative review. I am sorry.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was really good here but my issue is with their horrible service. I had never been here before but found this place from the yelp reviews. For the food alone, I would rate it at 3-4 stars but because of their shoddy service, it knocked them down a few stars.
When my two girlfriends and I were seated we noticed that there were two forks that were dirty on the table. There was a white milky film on them. We asked for new ones only to be brought one clean fork and one dirty fork. We had to take a clean fork off another table because the busboy had a hard time finding a clean fork.
There were only three tables including ours and no one ever checked up on us to see if everything was alright. I had to ask them to refill my water glass. I could understand if they were slammed, but they were very slow. They just didn't seem to care about tending to our table until it came time to paying the bill, then they were quick.
We asked to take our leftover food to go and they ended up throwing away one dish.
I would not return here because of their awful service and because I question their cleanliness based on their dirty cutlery unless I was ordering take out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent lunch experience!  We had Basil with tofu, and Green Curry with chicken, and 2 iced coffees.  Each lunch order comes with salad, rice, and 2 cream cheese wontons.  Everything was delicious!
Note: Their "mild" is pretty well-spiced.  I would recommend not telling them to make it spicy unless you like it very hot!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food great service. It is hard to find good Thai food. It's right here in Fullerton .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very poor service. They weren't very busy, but they never came by my table to ask if I needed anything. 

At first I waited a bit and tried to get the waitresses attention, but I ended up having to go to the counter if I wanted anything. During my visit, they refilled my water exactly one time. 

The food was alright, but I won't be going back there again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Use to come here all the time, and every time I've ordered my food very spicy and every time i got spices on the side but food was decent so I overlooked that minor factor, but tonight was the worst. 

Ordered Phad Thai with shrimp very very spicy, of course not a flake of chili, noodles were over cooked, soggy, too much sauce, strong taste ketchup, shrimp over cooked shriveled and rough. Beef Panang watered down, no thickness of curry, and Phad See Ew very bland. 

Food is no longer authentic! 

 Never again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">damn...this place was deceiving from the outside...two waiters in front,  SIX COOKS IN BACK. I ordered my usual chicken in mixed stur try veggies...man, what a treat! the other plates that were given to customers were "decorated" or arranged in such a way that I'll never forget this place! in Fullerton? go here, they will not disappoint!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The best customer service. They even HOLD MY BABY so mom and dad can enjoy there meal! They are sooo sweet here. Although last time I went they forgot my app and so sent it home with us. The food is so good I didn't ben mind as long as I got it! 

I'm not putting five stars because I feel it's slightly over prices for what your getting and sometimes they take too long and can forget things 

Def worth it and best thai in the area!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Messed up my order of pad kee mao they made pad see ew. They remade my food. Food is delicious  . 5 star.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">good food. when you ask for spicy they do not deliver. overall good thai place. prices are on the higher side but food is consistently good. 

my one complaint is that when I ordered my food I specifically told them that I was a vegetarian and wanted tofu yellow curry instead of chicken and they ended up giving me chicken. This was a pick up order. When I got home and opened my food and saw it was all chicken I was very annoyed. I called to let them know but was too tired from a 2 hour work commute to go back and pick up the right order. I have not been back since.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a regular stop for us,  but since they have remodeled it keeps getting better. 

The staff is friendly in most genuine way.  The food quality is great and we get white meat chicken on  all our dishes.   Tonight the staff was babysitting the customers kids while they enjoyed their dinner...  I don't have kids but I was getting a kick out of it.  Check this place out!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My out of town friend was visiting and asked to have Thai food so I did a quick Yelp search of my area and found Thailandia. Overall the food was good and the service not bad for an Asian restaurant. We ordered the pineapple fried rice, beef pad see ew, spicy chicken basil, and spicy chicken basil noodle. The spicy dishes were definitely spicy but not too overwhelming but you have the options of reducing the spicy flavor just make sure to let the server know. The noodle dishes were a little greasy and a bit too much garlic. The interior was clean and presentable. My only complaint was there was just one unisex bathroom with no changing table so be prepared if little ones need a diaper change. Oh and also the server did not offer us a highchair for my 18 month old. Luckily she sat on my lap and ate just fine. Overall I would eat here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in with my family for the first time and I wasn't impressed . The service was not that great and our waitress was made a lot of rude remarks. The food was ok and the prices were reasonable. Didn't enjoy the food enough to take home. Won't be coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decent food, very clean and nice atmosphere. PARKING IS TOO TIGHT in this retail center.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They have great food and very nice servers. B and Sue are the Best!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Four or five stars? No way. The food was fine, nothing great, and probably not even good enough to make me come back. Service and ambiance were also fine, but again, nothing special. Basically, it is just okay.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here with a group of friends and we all left very pleased and satisfied!
We ordered papaya salad, pad thai, soup, crispy chicken, and some ground chicken dish. They were all delicious and all of us licked out plates clean!

Pros: 
The restaurant is very clean and has a nice ambience  to it. 
Service was great didn't have to ask to get my water filled.
It was cheap for the quality of food you got.
Everything was fresh

Cons:
Parking can be a little difficult. I wanted to park near the handicap cause I'm too lazy to walk. 

I will come here again. That papaya salad was too good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm being quite generous because I am a total sucker for Thai food and luckily this place is super close to CSUF that it's easy to order take out and pick it up. So far I have tried the cashew nut chicken plate,which comes with a big ole side of rice and was SO BOMB. Came with zucchini,carrots, bell peppers,onions and chickkkennn.  I have also tried the Tom Yum which was ok. Not the best but still good overall. I also tried the pad Thai with chicken,which was probably the only plate I wouldn't get here again. I have my own Thai place closer to home thy satisfies my  taste buds. I would totally recommend this place to people and come again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everything was very fresh and delicious 
I am definitely coming here again.
The shrimp pad tai was great as was the combo appetizer. Friendly staff good beer.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went in on my lunch break from work wanting soup.  The waiter was so nice and told me about the lunch special. Such a good deal I ended up not getting soup and getting Yellow Curry with Chicken instead.  Great value and quick service.  With the exception of some batsh*t old lady who came in and started screaming at the staff, I'd say I really enjoyed it.

I'll be back for sure.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If a place has a good value, great tasting food, friendly service, and a clean environment, I leave a very satisfied customer. I'm not picky at all, but lately I haven't been all that impressed with too many establishments. 
Say hello to Thailandia. The food was absolutely delicious! And the portions were plentiful, but not over the top. I was full, but because the food was so good, I didn't want to stop eating-- I did, because I didn't want to have to be carted out of there. The environment was clean and I didn't notice any gross sticky spots on the menu or any food on the floor. I can't tell you how many times I've been to a restaurant and there is something slimy or sticky underneath the table I'm sitting at-- drives me nuts. Lastly, the service was quick, attentive, and very friendly. Our server was very helpful making suggestions to us, and quick bringing our food and refills. 
It was my first time at Thailandia, and it definitely will not be my last. I have now found my go to Thai spot here in Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nice Thai eatery located in a strip mall  on the east side of Fullerton.  The menu offers all of the Thai favorites with the specialty dish being Pad Thai.  This was my second visit here, but my first opportunity to provide feedback on Yelp.  I ordered the Pad Thai while my friend ordered the pumpkin curry.  Both were very good and tasted very fresh.  The service was very attentive, prices were average,  and the atmosphere was casual.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Serviceable.
The food was a bit bland, and who puts regular broccoli in pad see ew? Has to be the Chinese broccoli! That totally turned me off. The staff are lively and quick, but the food is just...enough to be edible. The pad thai was too sweet, not well seasoned, and not spicy at all, even when ordered at medium.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Get the pumpkin curry. It's very tasty. Good service, but when they get busy they take longer to serve you. They need to hire more people. Especially during the busy hours. 
Overall very good food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What a lovely place! The food and service here were tremendous!!

Service: Very friendly and attentive. 

Food: Amazing. I am a huge pad thai junkie and I usually like it to be more saucy and the kitchen was able to perfect that balance. It noodle itself was cooked well with some chewiness which I loved. The chicken was cooked perfectly where the moisture was still kept and full off flavor. 

I got this as part of the lunch special which came with a green salad with home made dressing that was very different and interesting, but it worked. It also came with 3 pieces of fried cream cheese wontons and they were on point. 

Drinks: I also ordered a thai tea and it was so refreshing and not too sweet. Craving definitely satisfied. 

Parking: The restaurant is located in a plaza with many other businesses so they share a parking lot which is spacious. 

Overall, I would love to return to this place to try out some more of the dishes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great Remodel and name change. Checking out their food.

Nope - not what it used to be. 

Friendly service but their stir fried veggies did not float my boat. 

They also made us serve our own soup which is kind of lame. 

Always a nice place to go but I wont go out of my way to go there like I used to.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite Thai place in Fullerton! It's small but it's a gem. They make Tom Ka Kai perfectly (chicken coconut soup). I'm pretty picky about my Thai food and they always nail it. The yellow chicken curry is really good too. I love thailandia. mmm hungry just thinking about it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is absolutely amazing! 

I totally recommend the spicy basil eggplant and the Tom yum soup! 

The best part about this restaurant, besides the food, is the amazing SER We went there 30 minutes before close, and they were so sweet. No one rushed us out the door or started mopping floors while we were still eating, unlike other places.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very disappointed in the food. The Panang was very flat and watery. I asked to exchange the chicken for beef and it was a mistake. The beef was tough and was full tendons. The Shrimp Choo Chee was also very flat and watery.  This dish had very little shrimp and a lot of carrots and peppers. Lastly they stated that they ran out of Chicken Satay; what kind of Thai restaurant would run out of this typical Thai dish?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down the best Thai food in Fullerton. Don't bother anywhere else, I've tried!

You will have to go as far as long beach to get anything that even comes close to how great this place is!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place serves very good and tasty Thai food. I eat here at least once or twice a week. There is a language barrier and sometimes when we ask to make our food a little different they sometimes they get it right. The other only Thai restaurant that has better food than here is in San Bernardino. I came here to thailandia last Friday for lunch, they had both doors wide open which I thought was odd. When we walked in it was a little warm. We always order the same thing Tom yum soup, pad see ew and a pot of white rice. 

About halfway through the meal it was so hot in there that customers that were arriving were questioning each other weather to dine there or leave because of how hot it was inside the restaurant. My two month old began to cry , when I picked him up from his car seat his whole back and  head was drenched in sweat. I caught myself several times wiping sweat off my face. I took my son and my drink and sat outside.  My wife sitting inside showed me something black I couldn't make it out, it turns out to be that the pot of rice had a dead black Beatle. When we showed our waitress she quickly took it and showed it to one of the cooks and Were both staring at us. It was so awkward. The server comes to our table and ask if we want some new rice we said yes. We had about half a pot of rice left when she took it. She came back with a small bowl of rice!!! We were like Wow!!  We decided to leave, they made us feel so awkward, their attitude completely changed after the Beatle incident. It was as if we were in the wrong for saying something. We paid the waitress and we were "supposed "to get two dollars and change back we waited about ten minutes and they never brought our change back. I guess they took it upon themselves to issue the tip.  Awesome food horrible service<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I won't come back this restaurant!
Food was bad and service was......?? We almost left all the food. Server never asked me how the food was. They're not that busy and work very slow.

I ordered

Appetizer combination: it was ok

Pat see-u: just too sweet

Salmon choon chee: Asian noodle will be better than spaghetti. Too sweet!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried the Orange chicken and shrimp pad Thai and booth were really good. Portions can be bigger but good for the price.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Formerly known as "Thai Rama" but I am unsure why there was a name change. Either there is a new owner or it really went out of business, but I doubt it.

The restaurant's old layout was crowded, but with the new name and all, the layout is better and clean. I want to say that it was such a great idea for them to add booth seatings to both sides of the restaurant with tables in the center of the restaurant. This venue is fairly large compared to Thai Basil which is across the street and also a popular Thai restaurant.

Food: I love coming here, even before it when the name was "Thai Rama" because of the portions. I know, that sounds all bad, but honestly, they give you so much food that is worth your buck! 8.50 for a lovely dish of your choice (majority of entrees range between 8.50-10.95; seafood dishes are a little more costly by 1-3 dollars). And I always can't deny the crab racoons (crab & cheese wontons - fried). It's so yummy! 

Service: the past couple times that I have gone within the month, it has been on the slower side when it came to service and getting our order taken. I think it has been the same young, Asian waitress on the main floor. I understand that she is probably the only one on duty, but it wasn't busy during the times I've gone which is mostly dinner time after 6 pm. However, they are quick with serving the food and beverages, just when ordering I been having slight trouble. And seating is of your choice for the most part. They're very polite and cheery, too! (the older hosts and workers)

Overall, this is my go-to Thai food joint. Hoooraaaaaay! (:<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very delicious and very reasonable price, especially with their lunch deal. It's a nice little restaurant in the corner of that lot and I was overall very satisfied. I will definitely go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We've always loved this place but we were really impressed when we visited during mother's day weekend.  We came in with a group of 8 and the small restaurant was already packed with a huge birthday party.  We do miss the days when there were hardly anyone patrons inside but I'm glad to see them getting loads of traffic these days.  This is our go to for thai food and have never been disappointed.  Why were we impressed? The server looked a bit overwhelmed since she was pretty much taking care of a fullhouse and the birthday group took up half the restaurant.  We expected to wait a long time since we ordered after that big ass birthday group and the server did mention that it may take awhile for all the food to start coming out.  We waited no more than 10-15 mins before we started getting our dishes.  Even though she had so many tables we never felt neglected and the poor woman did such a great job keeping everyone happy.  I love them even more after the name change :) I will mention that depending on the night the service experience does go from Good to Great but we have never had a bad experience.  I highly recommend this spot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Currently eating here, I can't get over how good this pat see ew is!! Would  recommend this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is great.  We planned on eating at another restaurant but the wait was too long so we Yelped this gem.  Delicious food, good service, great price.  Definitely will be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went to school at csuf so I've seen this place change a few times and I noticed the food got slightly better every time it did.

Last time I was here I ordered the Pad See Ew. It was good, but nothing special. What I enjoyed most was that it came out really hot! Unfortunately, the beef was a little dry for my liking. 

There was nothing I can really complain about the service. It was prompt and the owners are very nice!

All of that being said, I've eaten at Thailandia a few times, but it's never really my first choice of restaurants. There's just something that is missing I can't seem to put my finger on that doesn't make this place that stick out in my mind.

It's a decent restaurant in my book and a good place to have a meal with some friends.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not a Thai restaurant. This is yet again a Thai/Chinese restaurant. The pumpkin curry was very good. The pad Thai was a glutinous mass covered in corn
 starch. No glass noodle salad, no brown rice, but Hello! Szechwan chicken! This is a Chinese joint. If I want Chinese I'll go to a Chinese restaurant. This is one of the times I wish Yelp had half stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The thai food here is alright. What made me upset was that i looked on yelp to see what was open, and thailandia showed up. I was craving thai food so we rushed over. Showed up 25 minutes before closing and they wouldn't seat us. Umm.... Just say you close at 9:35 please, not 10:00.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great foods, good services. If you are looking for a place for family meal. This is the one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place was spot on!!! Had the Yellow Curry and friend had spicy garlic basil chicken! Both were FANTASTIC! Service was great and serving size was perfect for $ was able to take some home to the hubby.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OK, let me start by saying, I've been going to this restaurant since 1992, when it was Thai Rama and I was a college kid. While the owners and the decor has changed over the years, one thing has remained the same. The Food. Its excellent! This is the thai food place I judge all others by. 

Whether it be the Chicken larb, papaya salad, or even the chicken satay appetizer, which we usually order 3 for the kid as their meals, everything comes out fresh and tasty.

Our family recently went under the new name Thailandia, and I have to honestly say, this was the best dining experience I have had here. The staff was very attentive. Being a father of 9 year old triplets, one with down syndrome, I can tell you, the staff here  made every effort accommodate our needs, as well as customize some of their dishes and desserts to please my kids. 

I can highly recommend  this restaurant, and look forward to going here for many years to come.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely delicious best Thai place around try the orange chicken and shrimp egg rolls are amazing<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time I came here, I ordered green curry rice and was impressed! The spaggetti flat noodle is also tasty. Good for having lunch alone<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just gave this place a shot! I am a thai Snob and I must say that Thalandia hit my Thai spot! My now new favorite Thai food in all of Fullerton.  We had the Pumpkin curry with chicken & Green curry chicken with extra eggplant, the chicken was not gamey like most average thai restaurants. I didnt taste any game/funk in this chicken .This place rocks I highly recommend this one amongst all other thai restraunts in fullerton<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really enjoyed their food, their service was friendly. This was my first time trying Thai food and it was amazing. I will definitely be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service and delicious food! My friends and I loved it here! We ordered chicken and beef pad thai, a shrimp dish, fried rice and soup. Every dish came out perfect! I'll definitely be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very americanized food. It was okay to eat but I would think it was authentic in taste. Flavors were there but not intense like it should be.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nice setting, food is decently good. Price is not cheap but they have a pretty big portion. Service is fast, attentive and very friendly. They have improved their service a lot since few months back. A big plus for me is that they are willing to take any feedback, good or bad. Recommended for family or couple.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So many name changes recently. Thai Rama to Pad Thai to what is now Thailandia.  I've always liked the food despite the name. I'm not sure if owners have changed over but the cooking & ambiance has changed. It's a much brighter and more welcoming place to have lunch. The food portions are smaller but still feel light yet filling. Seasoned true to Thai cuisine. Things have picked up in price but still a decent value. However is still miss the Thai Rama I came to love. Thailandia is here to stay so I'm making the best of it and enjoying the friendly staff and new remodel. Green curry isn't as spicy as it used to be but I'm sure you can ask them to kick it up a knotch. BAM!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A great little Thai gem nestled in a shopping center with Big Lots and the 99 Cents store. I knew it would be good just from the diverse mix of folks dining there. I could tell many were from the neighborhood. It's clean, nicely decorated, and they had lovely music playing. We had the appetizer sampler and the spicy noodle (which they prepared in a mild version that was delicious.) As we are vegetarian, we were afraid we wouldn't find anything to eat, but our meal was wonderful. We might wish for more choices with dark green veggies -- broccoli, spinach/kale, but all in all, a great find. We'll be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Simply one of the best Thai restaurants in the Orange County area. Like mentioned before, the thai iced tea will quench any thirst.

Quite simply, I haven't had a bad dish. I really enjoy Tom Kha Gai (coconut soup) and this one is my favorite!

This place is family owned. The employees are some of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet. Once you go, you'll be hooked for life!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the basil ground chicken dish, my usual order, along with the pad see ew. Usually pretty good as far as taste and portion, seems better than Thai Basil across the street in my opinion. 

Rated 4 stars though cause taste isn't always consistent. Went here last week and the pad see ew seemed bland compared to other visits. I've been coming to this place for about 3 years. Also, I always order the basil ground chicken dish as medium spicy. Sometimes there's barely a hint of spiciness and other times, my mouth is on fire.

Overall, worth a try. Average service for an Asian place, meaning it's not horrible but it's not fantastic service either.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is AMAZEBALLS! I have eaten at Thai restaurants all over the USA ... This place has surpassed most if not all ... Delicious spicy beef salad, Thai tea , and pad see ew ... The spring rolls were good too but they pretty much r everywhere else too ;)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fast Service,  they advertise themselves as the best pad thai in town, i tried, i have had better,  the food is ok the prices are ok,  service was ok,   food came out super fast, i guess if you are in a hurry that is a good thing, the portion as ok,   nothing to make a stand out to be a 4  or 5 star<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pretty good thai food for the price! Loved the pad thai here! I dont usually like pad thai and this one was bomb!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've had the pad thai several times and it's been consistently good. HOWEVER, tonight was a little weird. Ordered to go and my food was ready in in about five minutes. That was a red flag to me that this might not be very fresh. When I opened up the togo container I found a small garden salad covering the portion of the food that usually holds the peanuts, sprouts etc., so that was annoying. My pad thai was clearly pre-mixed (which I love to do myself) and not fresh, two things they tried to conceal with a garden salad I didn't order and they've never included before. The pad thai was passable but nowhere near as good as it has been in the past. They lose a star from me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went to eat for my monthiversary with the boyfriend. We ordered a combo appetizer plate, tom yum soup, pad Thai, pad see ew. It was yummy but wasn't really friendly on the wallet. Everything came out to be about $50. Well $50+ with tip. So like $10/plate.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good ambiance. ...bit service is wishy washy. Food okay. Same ole same ole. Service was miserly...I don't like that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went in for lunch with the family around 2.30pm and though they were getting ready to close for their lunch break, they didn't seem annoyed or anything. Maureen was our server and she was really nice and helpful. 
We got the shrimp pad thai and beef pad see ew (as per yelp's recommendations). Shrimp pad thai was a little bland, but maybe that's because we didn't ask to make it spicy :/ The beef pad see ew was everyone's favorite :) The lunch entrees (11am-3pm) are a good deal since you get the same amount as the normal entree, but it's $1-2 less :) 
While i'm not generally a fan of thai food, it was overall a nice experience and the food was good. The rest of the staff didn't seem all that friendly, but our server Maureen was great. Not sure that i'll be going back anytime soon, but I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a thai food place that's not expensive~<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The seafood tom yum soup was tasty. The pad thai was alright. The service was nice but they did lag once a bigger party came in. Overall its a good place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great place to eat Thai Food.  Their food is impeccably delicious!  I would definitely eat here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">food was ok...kinda pricey for a whole in the wall joint!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best Thai Food in the OC! Awesome service! My goal is to try everything on the menu but I can't get past the Pad Thai, Coconut Soup,Orange Chicken and Crab Fried Rice! LOVE IT! Overall great value with good sized portions. Their soups are a MUST TRY!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow, we had a wonderful meal here.  Here are the things we ordered: Thai coconut soup with chicken, chicken satay, tofu pad thai, beef panang, Thai fried rice with chicken and basil leaves, and tilapia ka krow.  There was richness and delicacy in each dish.  I could taste the herbs through the sauces, so there was this wonderful balance of richness and lightness at the same time.  The pad thai was very slightly over sweet but I ate a lot of it anyway.  I have been to many Thai places and this in terms of preparation and cooking is one of the best.  I just wish they would add to their menu pad woon sen.  That is my absolute favorite noodle dish. I would come back again for sure.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I dont think ill be coming back here any time soon due to the food quality. 

I ordered togo with a friend and the cashier said it would be about 20 minutes. After taking a walk at the 99 cents store, we came back 30 mins later and our food was nowhere close to being ready! The waiter said it would be another 20 minutes. I understand that they were busy because it was a friday around dinner time. But we were on a time crunch and could not wait that much longer. We were about to cancel the order and the waiter then went to the back and was able to get our orders out within 5 mins.

I ordered a simple pad thai and i was not happy about my order. My noodles were bright orange, they kind of looked like it was soaked in food coloring and my noodles were a little flavorless. I also barely had any chicken in my order. The strange thing was that the next morning after i microwaved my noodles, they tasted about x5 better. On the bright side, they provided me with a lot of noodles, enough to fill 2.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love coming here with family and friends! The food is excellent and decently priced, and I love the way they decorate for various holidays!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everything I ordered was so tasty! The panag, spicy beef and papaya salad were all deslicious! I will be back to stuff my face again, yum!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here upon the recommendation of a friend and was very impressed with the food and service. The spicy basil chicken was my favorite. We also had the pad thai, cream cheese wontons, tom kah kai, and a curry dish - all were fantastic! And to top it off, the staff was super friendly and attentive. I plan to come back to try their mango sticky rice when it's in season and get a second helping of all the deliciousness<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Place sucked! Waitress guided us to our seats, later comes back and asks us if we're getting this To-go! Obviously NOT...we're sitting down to dine in. Then she walks away and no one served us, we waited for about 7 min  and the place wasn't even busy! We got up left and had dinner at Thai Basil across! Much better!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is hands down the best Thai food I've ever eaten! The restaurant is clean, the ambiance is very comforting, the food is out of this world good! Both the presentation of their dishes and the quality of their food is second to none! If you live in the Fullerton area don't sleep on this place! I came all the way from Santa Clarita to have dinner with my sister and would gladly come back with my wife for a nice dinner date here! Take it from me i am professionally trained chef!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great Thai food and our waitress was super friendly. It is located  in back corner and worth finding.  Pumpkin curry was excellent. 
Nice decor and  clean. We will be back,<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We love Thai food and we always look for a new place to try. After sampling several dishes we can easily say this place is our new favorite. It's a little drive from Newport Beach, but well worth the drive!  We'll be back soon!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decent at best, a little bland, wontons were cold, spring rolls were more dough and wrap than stuffing.  Curry noodles and rice were pretty tasty and for the price it was good food.  Not my first choice but still better than others I've tried in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sadly, I can't really rate this place much better than this.  My husband ordered for us the Tom Yum Goong soup which is the clear (meaning without the coconut milk added) but spicy lemongrass soup WITH SHRIMP.  It did NOT have the soup's usual distinct flavor AND it had Chicken in it instead; which is known as Tom Yum Gai soup.  BIG DIFFERENCE in hearing the Goong versus Gai. (??!!??).  And what few eggplant chunks were in the Green Curry, they were undercooked.  Sorry.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here to grab some food on a take-out order and came in and was excited because it was my first time to Thailandia and I work around the corner. The food was pretty yummy. So I get there and parking was a little pain but found a spot. I get in and the food was ready to go and my co-workers had told me make sure you ask for a few  chili sauces because they're stingy with them. Sure enough I opened my bag and there was only one sauce for an order for four people my total was 34 bucks so they should have gave me at least 2-3. I ask for 5 and she gives me one and then she walks away and the other girl comes up and I ask her for 4-5 chili sauce, she gives me two. I look at her and say " I will pay you for these, can I please have two more" she looks at me and says sorry sorry, here you go. Shoot people, you're not going out of business because you give me 4-5 chili sauces. 2 stars because the food was good<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is so good! I never get disappointed. The lunch specials are the best too! Great price,good food and alot for your money.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great place to get takeout.  The food is delicious!  Reasonably priced.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in with a relatively large group and they were quick to seat us. I tried Thai food for the 1st time at a different place but didn't like it at all for being bland but trying the food here is a world of a difference.The food was flavorful but I think the price is a little high in relation to the portions. The bad- they had two different servers helping us so there was some confusion and delays with getting the food out. Not a big deal at all... will probably be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is honestly the worst Thai food I ever had! I ordered Pad Thai and the flavor is wrong. I was surprised that this place gets 4 stars. Their service, however, is good. But food is bad!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very disappointed. I'm a returning customer who enjoyed the food last time and was excited to share it with my visiting family. 
Called for take out and had a problem with our phone connection. The guy taking our order was extremely rude even after we apologized (3 times...) for being cut off. Lost our business. Sad too, we would have frequented the place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here twice and had wonderful experiences. The service was helpful /kind and the food was AMAZING!  I have been to Thailand and this food is authentic as it gets. Must try :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">by far the worst Thai food I've had in California.   Spring rolls was all batter and no shrimp.  Pad see ew lacked sufficient seasoning.  Curry was soup based and inauthentic.  Customer service was not the best either.  To be fair we got take out but the lady helping me just ignored me when I asked whether I could use American Express.  All in all, stay away and go to thai basil across the street instead.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was craving Thai food after class and knew about this place for a while. I finally had the time to go and try it and holy Jesus it was actually good. I recommend the Pad See Ew. It was seasoned perfectly and it was enough to make my friend and I super full. The price was also fair. I plan on going to this place again very soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">this thai restaurant has been here for several years, and has gone under many name changes, which honestly confused me. however, upon looking at the menu, tasting the food, and seeing some familiar faces, i'm pretty sure that the restaurant has remained the same as it was since it was thai-rama, though with many vast improvements.

the ambiance of the place has changed dramatically. there's abundant lighting, a good amount of seating, and even a flat screen tv to watch while you're waiting for your order. i also like how they're festive with the holidays! they had a nice tree up during christmastime, and colorful balloons for valentine's day. :)

the food has always been good, and cheap. if anything, the dollar sign rating on yelp should be lowered to one. but anyways, some of my favorite dishes:
- pad see ewe: hands down, the best. the noodles are thick and chewy, the flavor of the sauce is just too good.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.
- orange chicken: you're probably thinking "ew, orange chicken?!", but believe me, their orange chicken is not like your average chinese take-out kind. the chicken is crispy, and the sauce is tangy, but not overpowering. 
- garlic pepper chicken: another good dish. the garlic pepper can accompany any kind of meat, but it's really good with chicken
- any of their fried rice dishes

their thai tea and taro tea are really good too, and the service has always been great.

the location is situated in the corner of the plaza near the 99 cent store, and is adjacent to pho olivia. so it's a bit hard to find, but it's worth looking for. i'm not a csuf student, nor do i live in the area (sadly), but if i did, this would definitely be my go-to spot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">To preface, I'm from Iowa, so my experience with Thai cuisine could probably fit onto a postage stamp. That said, I think Thailandia served up an excellent meal. I started out with a Chang beer, which was surprisingly sweet but light. I ordered the Crispy Fish with Chili (Pla rad prik) with mild heat, since I know the Thai spiciness scale ramps up pretty drastically. This entree was delicious and had just the right amount of spice. The chunks of tilapia were evenly fried to give them a crunchy exterior without being dried out. I finished off the meal with a bubble tea.

I ate here for supper on a Monday evening and was served in no time. The wait staff were all responsive and pleasant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was ok, I've had much better. I can't believe they have 4 1/2 stars! Had to ask for silver wear and a napkin 5 times till they finally brought me one. I was not impressed! Has 7 adults in our party and was charged 18% gratuity for mediocre food and service. Won't be coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very clean friendly service and great good. LUNCH SPECIALS GREAT PRICE. I ordered the spicy Thai noodles. Very flavorful and comes with a little appetizer and salad!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food, okay service for it being pretty busy, right after the lunch rush. Waitress made up for it by offering me another thai iced tea for the road :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Too bad so sad. I will not go back to Thailandia, ever. Sucks because I really like the name. My friend best friend Greg and I started with the veggie spring roll, but they looked more like a fried cigar. Greg thought they were gross and had a fishy flavor. and I would never order again. The pad thai was nasty. Don't order it unless you like nasty pad thai. The eggplant with tofu was alright. The sauce was good. Oh , and the orange chicken was so disgusting! I don't  even want to talk about it, because makes me mad. The only reason I would go back to Thailandia is to drink wine and watch the the waitress forget things. Now she was amusing to watch.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was delicious, except, the pics on the menu does not match the really food were served. But the overall experince was pretty good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has never disappointed!! Delicious and generous shrimp in curry and noodle dishes. The service is also friendly and prompt!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">affordable prices + large portions + clean ambiance + cute and super friendly waitresses (Thanks Amy! :) = 2 thumbs up!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">GRRR...EAT Thai food. We had the pumpkin curry. To. Die. For. Great atmosphere. Awesome owners. Recommend.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went here twice. First time it was fantastic! The service was good and so is the foods, but then again I guess it was because there weren't a lot of people there. The prices is a tiny bit more expensive than some of the Thai restaurant I have been to ranging from $6-13. (One of my favorite Thai place only charged up to $12). Second times went in on Valentine's Day with my boyfriend and let just say this time is the reason why I gave the review a 3 stars. We originally want to go to Thai Basil which is across the street but it was pack and I mean like people were standing in line waiting to be seated so we left and decided to go to this restaurant instead. The Service was once again A+, the place was not as crowded as Thai Basil, there were some seats still available. We got seated and order; Everything went smoothly until 15 minutes went by, then 20, by the time it is 35 mins and still no foods I was getting a little frustrated. The place wasn't even that crowded and apparently the table next to us, who was there before us, did not get any foods neither. My boyfriend told me to give it a little more time and we waited for another 10 minutes. 45 minutes had passed, still no foods, at that time we are both so hungry that we just cancel our order and left. This place is alright if it is not on a Holiday or special day otherwise I do not think I would go here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I come here about once every other month. The staff never dissapoints me and everything is so fresh. If your a fan of pad thai than this is the spot! This is my favorite pad thai and ive gone to many thai restaurants.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went in during the crazy rush lunch hour and was worry that the service would suffer when I was seated. I was never so wrong before. Server came to my table in little to no time and food came out before I realize it. And I have to say the yellow curry they make is some of the best I had in a long time. Service was fast and friendly, food was amazing, and prices were cheap. What more can a collage student ask for =3<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We like many others have been eating Thai food at this location for years. But with the new name and renovations, it has become incredible. Last night we had the spicy basil noodle, prik king beef and panaeng curry. They were all great! Good portions and very nice service. A very memorable meal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ok love this place but was disappointed to have been turned away at the door for cleaning this is not the first time. I guess on Wednesday's 3-4 they are closed. This is not noted on hours of business.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious thai place. I think they recently changed owners? Mid price dishes but good flavor and good size of dishes. Service is very friendly and helpful.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Anytime I go to a Thai restaurant, I judge them on their Pad Thai. It was pretty good but lacked the punch of flavor you get from the Pad Thai at Pei Wei. That being said....it was pretty damn good and the portion was pretty big. Really clean restaurant  and I'm sure I'll be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thailandia is AWSOME! Their food is a cut above all other Thai restaurants in the Orange County area esp. Fullerton. The atmosphere is friendly, and happy. The flavor is spot on! Curries, Pad Thai and Pad Si Eil noodles are AWSOME and fresh. They even have a little window looking into the kitchen so that u see for your self how clean they are. The place itself is perfect for a romantic dinner.  The wait staff is kind,and very professional too. Go there on your next date night! You will not be disappointed. 
I would also recommend their "Lunch Special" which is SO reasonable and the food is so good. They will give you more than enough food than you can eat. I would go there everyday for their lunch special.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is good.  I have had several dishes and not been disappointed in one.  The service is a bit on the slow side, but mostly friendly.  The AC does not seem to keep up very well.  They do not take AMEX, which is annoying.  Prices could be lower, especially at lunch time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been eating this place for over twenty years, and through its recent name changes, For years this was Rama Thai, and then Pad Thai and now, hopefully finally,Thailandia.  The food throughout has always remained consistently good, and really the only place in Fullerton I will go to for great Thai food.  The other places are passable, but pale in comparison. I highly recommend the Tom Kah coconut chicken soup and the pumpkin curry is to die for.  The service is attentive and this is a family owned place, which is nice.   My only complaint from my dinner there last night was the that it was freezing cold in there.  They need some work on their thermostat.   Otherwise they would have five stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has awesome food for pretty cheap! I want to give them five stars but sadly, the service blows. They take forever to aknowledge that you are standing waiting to be seated, you really don't need 20 minutes to look at the menu, getting the food to the table doesn't seem to be that big of a problem, but the thing that takes the longest...30 minutes or more is getting the check. Bring cash so you don't have to wait another 15 minutes for them to run your card! I keep coming back to be subjected to the waiting game because the food is that good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a nice little place tucked away in the dark corner of a strip mall but it's worth looking for. Walking in, it's not what you would expect to find in a shopping center like this; the interior is lusher than, say, the Burger King across the street but not swanky enough to scare away the casual diner. They have the best Tom Kah Kai and cream cheese wantons of any Thai place I've tried thus far and it, and much everything else on the menu, comes in portions that could easily be shared by a couple of people. The food is so good you probably won't want to share, though. They have a good variety of items and are willing to do substitutions for the vegetarians out there. Service has always been friendly and helpful whenever I've been there; they're very concerned with the satisfaction of their customers. It's a classy little joint that I highly recommend.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really good food...but smallish portions. Not expensive and very delicious. Great service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely love the new place. Last I've been here it was Thai Ramma, which was good but now the ambiance is nicer the food is fantastic and the portions are great. Customer service has improved greatly as well!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">YUMMY!!! I LOVE this Thai place.  Its WAY WAY WAY better than Basil Thai across the street by Panera.  That place is gross dirty, blah food, and rude service with dirty servers.  THAILANDIA is located in an unattractive shopping center across from CSUF, in the same parking lot of the 99Cents store, Goodwill, and Big Lots.  HOWEVER, do not let the poor location deter you from experiencing a delicious meal.  This restaurant is very clean with modern decor.  All the servers have on clean, pressed uniforms.  The tables, chairs, and furniture are all in great shape and the upkeep in obvious. The restroom is clean and not close to any portion of the restaurant where tables are settled.   Now for the food.....my husband's favorite are the Pad Thai shrimp noodles. They are amazing...and I have tried many, many versions of this dish at various Thai restaurants.  The shrimp is large and succulent, not small and dry like in some other places, and the peanut sauce is not heavy, but light and savory.  This dish does have some square bits of tofu, but is was cooked just right and also tasted great.  I love their Spicy Eggplant dish with chicken.  The portion comes with a small salad and 2 cream cheese wontons, and a huge portion of rice.  I also LOVE their coconut chicken soup...it's so yummy I could have that every day. Basically, we usually share both meals and end up taking enough home to eat another meal the next day.  I LOVE this place...and the prices are decent as well.  The only issue I have is with their Thai Boba tea; it seems to me that it's not very potent, rather watered-down version of the authentic tea.  If you love Thai food and would like to try a new place, give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service.  Awesome food.  Must try red curry w/ chicken!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The spicy chicken basil is to die for. I've eaten there 3 times now, and every time the food and service has been superb.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Had lunch special at this restaurant a month ago.  Daughter and I thought it was very tasty and the cost quite reasonable.  Service was also spot on.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everything we've eaten here is fantastic except the BBQ chicken.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is ok but nothing special. My server smelled like cigarets and perfume which I hate. The food is ok but not great. The service is just ok too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nothing special I can understand that there's two waitress in a busy restaurant but when I ask for water twice then I told her and remind her again, then I was looking at her over in he counter laughing with other waitress looking at us. Then the owner was trying to promote to his white couple about her restaurant and telling them she can give a free drinks. But then the owner just pass as by that I have question! Is it because we are Asian?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is soooo good! My favorite Thai place around. I come here about once a week with my two best friends. Or as often as we can. It's usually the first restaurant we think of when we wanna go out.The servers recognize us and are very sweet. The food is delicious. I know a lot of people that frequent this place because it's the best Thai around! We usually order the pineapple fried rice with shrimp. It has so much flavor and is delicious. I love their shrimp pad Thai. So tasty. Their tom kah Kai soup is delicious! Not overbearing with flavor. It's just right and a large portion just like all of their dishes. I even brought a picky 7 year old and she loved the food. The restaurant is very clean. Staff is friendly and attentive, food is delicious, can't complain. I'm only curious as to why they aren't packed with customers??<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great Curry Food. Good service. Try the dessert fried banana with coconut ice cream.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pad See Ew is really good....it is a perfect place to come when you feel bored with fast food in the university...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai Rama. Pad Thai Corner. Thalandia. I've been through all the name changes this place has had. Fortunately, the quality of food doesn't change as often as the name does. I love this place. I find it comforting when I look in the kitchen, and there are actual cooks that match the restaurants ethnicity (what a noble concept)! There is usually a little Thai lady with a hat on whipping everything up, so I tip my hat to her. The service, at times, is unbearably slow. Recently, the Tom Yum has been hit or miss, when up until a few months ago, it was a consistant 10. The waitresses don't always speak much English, which I don't mind in an ethnic restaurant. But some of the ladies here are very helpful. Bea (I hope I spelled that right) is a young waitress that often helps me understand what hot sauce to pair with what food (and finds an occasional free Thai tea my way). Another older waitress once held our newborn the whole time so we could enjoy our dinner, and that is going above and beyond the call of duty. Tom Kai is excellent. When the Tom Yum is working, it's a perfect balance of sour sweet and spicy. The eggplant beef is on par. The drunken noodle is another favorite, though I wish they would cook the noodles just a little more for caramelization. The spicy fried rice pairs perfectly with shrimp. I'm not sure I will ever get the chance to visit Thailand, but until then, I am happy visiting Thailandia.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Food. Its excellent! This is the thai<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is amazing!! Not only is their food and service great, but the portions are just right. Prices are reasonable and with a variety of Thai dishes. I loved the pad see eww! It is a must try dish! The bonus is how clean the restaurant, utensils and dishes are!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place will change you life. Too long have you gone through existence without a exquisite pumpkin curry. The thia tea is the best in the area. This restaurant is far superior to all others. Come support family owned buisness.<p>
</p></p>
