<p itemprop="description">Hands down my favorite pizza place and location (sorry orange) but Fullerton Pizza Press takes the homerun on this one!

They're employees are always cheerful, energetic, and enthusiastic when creating/delivering the pizzas. They always have patience when building your own pizza, and have a smile on their face. Smaller than the location in orange but way more ambiance!

The manager even gave me beer samples to try! 

Not as greasy as blaze pizza or thin as pieology. Their flatbread is actually chewy yet crispy so it's the perfect pizza by far. Highly recommend this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decided to try this place after seeing the great reviews. I love pieology so I thought this would likely be great as well.

The pizza crust was not crispy enough. It almost felt like it needed more time in the oven.

Tried the red sauce and it had almost no flavor. It left much to be desired. 

All the other veggie toppings were pretty standard. Oh and I asked for aged parmesan (listed topping) and the guy making the pizza said it's done at the end..the girl at the end said oh it's on your table. I wanted real shredded Parmesan not the powder stuff on my table... 

I'm wishing I would've stuck with pieology since this was my last night in town. 

The décor is nice and staff was friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">great selection of craft brews and delicious pizza!!!  pick from the menu or design your own.  either way, great sauce, fresh toppings, and fast service.  

joe bob says check it out!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can make the ultimate pizza but...

I went to the pizza press the other night with my girlfriend because it looked good and people seemed to like it so why not. We like blaze and pieology so we thought we give this place a try. We get there and there's 3 people in front of us. It's our turn and we're putting what we want on our pizza. I ask if they had sauteed onions and the guy responds "yah they were at the beginning, but it's fine I'll put them on now." Ok I guess. I didn't know it was a pain to add them since it being our first time there and nobody was behind us. Then guy has us pay and asks if we want drinks. So I got my girlfriend and I two regular drinks. He didn't give them to us. He just walked away after we paid. So we're like ok maybe we get our drinks when we get our pizza. We had to ask another guy for the drinks because the other guy was talking to the girl working. The pizza was great and I can make the ultimate pizza here but that one guy made it a little weird on us. We will go back but definitely try to go when the guy isn't there. That is what stopped me from giving them 5 stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">In all honesty, my build-your-own-pizza phase has passed, so I found the ingredients and product here to be just like any other business in this category. However, the extra star is from a design standpoint: I was impressed with the thematic elements of their process.

The once beloved newspaper gets a creative revival at The Pizza Press, where the idea is that you publish your own pizza story on site. While most will go that route, the menu does feature preset variations in tribute to well-known titles like "The Gazette," "The Herald," "The Times," etc.

I'm one to put a range of toppings on the crust (meats, veggies, sauces) and was persuaded by the "newsboys" to add their basil pesto dressing after my edition came hot off the press. Remind me to stick to the basics next time.

They do have SoCal craft beer options so it adds to the social element of your dine. Our group had a nice chat together in a booth while eating our pies, which, by the way, are brought out to you on branded pizza peels. Nice touch. 3.75<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza Press has become my favorite create you own pizza chain!
The ingredients are fantastic, not just the selection, but also the quality.
Great crust and sauces, such good flavors, we were all blown away  just how good our pizza was!
The salads are fresh and tasty as well, prices are amazing.
Service fantastic, location nice, clean and plenty of seating.
Great addition to the area and cheap dining option!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">SUCH A GOOD PIZZA!! I came here for the 1st time about a week ago during lunch time, the wait was not long at all & it was so good! My group & I absolutely loved it!
I ordered a pizza with spicy sauce, mushrooms, pepperoni, bell peppers, jalapeños, mozzarella cheese, and added Parmesan cheese on top. It was bomb  the service was very friendly & employees were patient as well. I will definitely come back with more friends!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Friendly and attentive staff, decent beer selection from local breweries too and amazing pizza. Just FYI, I do not care for pieology! The pizza press has the same concept as pieology however my pizza was much more flavorful here! 

I will definitely be coming back here again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Another great build-your-own pizzeria.

Nowadays there are so many Build-Your-Own Pizza restaurants that it's hard to tell the difference between all of them.  I would say the only way to tell them apart now are through their methods, service, and experience.

Methods - You start off the same by choosing your base sauce and ingredients.  Once it's ready to cook, Pizza Press places their pizza in a conveyor belt oven rather than the usual stone fire oven other pizza places offer.  Once it comes out from the other end, you can add additional topping/sauce such as Cilantro, Basil, Arugula, Pesto, BBQ, Sriracha, Frank Hot Sauce, Balsamic Vinegar, and Chimmichurri.  (My favorite are Basil/Pesto).  

One thing I wish they had was Tabasco.  

Service - They workers were really nice.  They gave us a free drink for a Yelp check-in and would stop by our table to check up on us.  I noticed that they have a LARGE selection of draft beer.  If you enjoy drinking beer while eating pizza, here is the place.  None of the other Build Your Own Pizza places have a draft IPA Selection like they do.  This is one service that puts them on top over Pieology, Blaze, & Pizza Rev.

Experience -   I would come here again if I am ever in the area.  I would choose Pizza Press over the competition but I would not go out of my way for this place.  I wish they had one closer to my house but unfortunately the only one near my house is Blaze Pizza.. LOL<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza Press is our new favorite build-your-own pizza place. The restaurant is very cozy with communal seating, private booths, and plenty of outdoor seating. Pretty cool that they have a ton of wine and beer on tap!

The Garlic Cheesy Bread is basically like a cheese pizza. There's a subtle taste of garlic, but as a garlic fanatic, I think I'd like a stronger garlic flavor. Maybe I'll ask for extra garlic next time - the service here seems fantastic so I don't think it'll be a problem.

Their pizzas have a perfectly crisp and thin crust every time we've eaten here, and yes they do hand roll the dough. I personally like being able to pick up my thin crust pizza and having it stay in tact :) The toppings are good quality. I typically think the chicken is too dry as a topping at most build-your-own pizza places, but I enjoyed the chicken at Pizza Press. Try adding pesto when they ask you if you want to top your pizza with any sauce! Love that the pizza is done minutes after paying at the cash register. If you like thin crust pizza I don't think you can go wrong unless you don't choose wisely for your toppings haha.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Pizza Press is another one of those make your own pizza type places. This location is right across from Cal State Fullerton. Because of that, it was like most of the crowd were college students.

They have seven signature pizzas which are named after newspapers. Most are priced around $8 - $11. You can also make your own pizza. Here they call it a "publish your own" which is around $8. They have five different types of sauces, 10 different types of cheeses, 16 vegetable toppings, and five meat toppings. Aside from pizzas, they do have salads (there's a publish your own option as well), beverages (includes fountain drinks, milk, coffee, beer, and wine), ice cream (scoop, sandwich, or float), and other desserts (chocolate chip cookie or tiramisu). 

I had a "publish your own" pizza with pineapple. The pizza was pretty good. The crust was slightly burnt at the edges but the rest of the pizza was soft and chewy. The pizza wasn't greasy at all. Each time I placed my hand the bottom of the pizza slice I didn't get grease all over. Good portion of the pineapple. The pineapple was fresh and sweet. The mozzarella and the red sauce were good. The ratio of the cheese, toppings, and red sauce were spot on. 

There's MUCH better ventilation here as opposed to the Anaheim location. Here, the air is well circulated throughout. I just couldn't breathe at the other location with it being super hot and the smell of pizzas cooking every step of the way. 

The restaurant is an L shape. It's spacious with quite a few tables. Most of the seating consists of booths. 

The service was pretty good. We were greeted immediately upon entry. The servers were very friendly and always had a smile on their face. The pizza was done within a few minutes.

Overall, pretty good pizza. I feel that the pizza here is much better than Pieology. Will be back for another visit!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Overall this place is just okay. I came here for lunch today and I honestly wasn't impressed. To begin with I was rudely greeted by a worker. She then asked me if I was there before and I told her no. I was then told how the place works. Basically you can choose one of their pre-thought out pizza or you can build your own. If you chose one of their pre-thought out pizza, then you can take whatever off you want. 
I ended up getting their build your own pizza. It was seriously SO hard to hear the people behind the counter. Their sneeze guard was really tall (and i'm 5'8") and the radio was too loud! The lay out of the toppings seemed disorganized. Some of the cheeses were with the vegetables and it just seemed odd. 
The crust itself was very bland. They didn't offer any different kind but one other than was just a gluten free version of the their standard dough. 
The price was about $9 for a build your own.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When I was in grad school across the street, the Pizza Press was one of our staples for dinner. The food was delicious and great service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A friend of mind recommended this place a few months back, but I haven't found a time to try it out.  Tonight, pizzas sounded really good, so I decided to stop by The Pizza Press.

Generally, build your own pizza is really not my cup of tea. I prefer CPK, Bj's, Round Tables or even Pizza Hut. Well, you get the point. I basically like to just order from the menu rather than building my own. Anyhow, I was glad I stopped by The Pizza Press because it was yummy! 

The dough was pressed fresh and made to order. The process was actually pretty clever. You build your pizza and by the time you get to the cashier to pay, your pizza is done.  The dough came out perfectly crunchy in addition to the perfect sauce and toppings. 

I also build my own salad, it was ok, can't say it was good.  Mainly because the dressings were not good.  They came on a package, like Mc Donald's. Dressings is what makes a salad, so if you don't have great dressings, the best you can get is an ok result. But I was there to try their pizzas, not the salads. Therefore, this rating is specifically for the pizza.

The customer service was EXCEPTIONAL!  The guys were so helpful, cordial, accommodating and pleasant to deal with.  The price was also super inexpensive. I believe it was only $8.00. I will be back very soon.

Tips: Great Parking availability and convenient. Check in on Yelp to redeem a free soft drink. 

Customer Service: 5/5

Quality: 5/5 (for the pizza)
Quantity: 5/5
Price: 5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Build your own pizza places have been popping up everywhere.  Pizza Press is another one of those places, what makes it differ from other places is that it doesn't use the stone fire grill to cook the pizzas; instead the pizzas are placed on a conveyer belt that takes the pizza into an oven and out the other end.  This particular Pizza Press is located across from Cal State Fullerton next to a couple other small restaurants.  

My first impression when I walked in was that the place was small.  The décor was lovely though, deep brown leather booths, and black and white paint.  The format of the restaurant leads me to think that it gets quite congested at peak hours.  When you walk in, you're immediately greeted with the first station of the pizza building.  There's not much room for an actual line to form.  

Now, let's break down the food.  First you choose your pizza crust; I believe they have a regular crust and gluten free.  Next you pick your sauce, I tried the pink sauce (which is basically a mixture between the red sauce and the alfredo sauce).  They also had a spicy red sauce and a couple others (that I, unfortunately can't remember off the top of my head).  I was very pleased to see that they had several types of cheese to choose from, on top the basic mozzarella.  I opted to add smoked gouda to my pizza.  There were also several types of meat:  pepperoni, sausage, Italian sweet sausage, bacon, chicken.  I went with a basic pepperoni pizza, topped with red onions, jalapenos, spinach, olives, and aged parmesan.  The pizza came out fairly quickly, and then you're met with several sauces that can be drizzled on the pizza:  BBQ sauce, pesto, ranch, etc. 
 
I also loved that they had 10-15 beers on tap.  Don't forget to check in on yelp to receive a free fountain drink with your pizza as well.  

The pizza was good, but I've come to learn that the quality of these build your own pizza places are very subjective.  I liked the Pizza Press because the crust was thin and crispy, and the pizza wasn't greasy.  I'd definitely come here again, I enjoyed the food, and the staff was nice.  I can see that this place probably gets pretty busy during the school year, so beware of that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">FOOD // there are a lot of options for toppings and a large range of them, too.

I published my own of course :)) including:

Olive oil spread as the base, I liked this better than getting a traditional sauce actually!
Mozzarella cheese (btw there are a LOT of cheese options, you can get regular mozz or the balled ones).
Mushrooms, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, zucchini & squash, minced garlic for toppings. I had to ask for more spinach because they only put little amounts...
Basil leaves and basil pesto to garnish. 

The best part was the basil pesto, could not recommend stronger. It's very tasty and adds a delicious touch!

Overall, my pizza was really tasty but had burnt spinach leaves and some sun dried tomatoes too.. But still amazing! Definitely better than blaze or pieology.

SERVICE & PARKING // parking is easy, the lot is pretty big. We had a huge group and it still worked out. Most of us sat outside and took some of Flame Broiler's seating.

I had to wait extra for my pizza because they switched up my pizza with one of my friend's moms... But it was a pretty quick process so I was fine with it. Other than being a little scarce with my spinach and artichoke hearts (don't limit my spinach lol) service was good. Especially because my mom spilled her drink all over the floor, and they took care of it, good one mom.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Pizza Press' layout and theme!

Service: Great! This was my first experience here so I told the pizza man straight up that I didn't know what I was doing. He was super nice and gave me the low down on the UNLIMITED topping options for the "publish your own pizza" combo.

Pizza: I like! My pie came out crispy and yummers. I must say, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a pizza from here and Pieology though (don't hate me, pizza enthusiasts). I went a little crazy with my toppings: pink sauce, minced garlic, caramelized onions, mozzarella, parmesan, artichoke, shrooms, olives, bacon, zucchini and squash! My breath is probably kickin from all this garlic and onion but its all good.

Alcohol selection: I wish I got a chance to try something, but alcohol on the clock didn't seem like the best idea. Definitely returning to give it a try though!

Ambiance: The theme is super cute, from the pizza assembly line to their fun booths to their trashcans. Loving the spaciousness!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of the better build-your-own pizza places out there! The idea is just the same as pieology and blaze pizza where you pick your own unlimited amount of toppings for a set price. What I like most is that they have just a bit of a wider selection of toppings to choose from. For example, they not only have minced garlic, but they also whole garlic cloves. Mmm, you have no idea how appealing that is to me. They also have sundried tomatoes, argula, pink sauce (a rarity and my favorite!), sweet baby ray's bbq sauce.. Just to name a few other things not seen at other pizza places. They also have a good variety of beer, which can change depending on when you go. I got a pomegranate cranberry cider once and it was SO good!

I would've given 5 stars, but they burnt my sundried tomatoes the second time I went :( Nothing else was burnt though, and the quality of the pizza was still great. They also open pretty late, which is another plus!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love places like this where you can customize your own food. Pizza press is similar to pieology or blaze pizza. You get to pick the sauce and toppings on your personalized pizza. After the pizza is cooked, they have additional toppings you can add to the pizza like arugula, basil, pesto sauce. If you like pesto, then I highly recommend adding that to your pizza. Super delicious! The pizza comes out on a wooden board, which looks pretty hipster. You can also get a free fountain drink if you check in on Yelp. 

The service here is great. While throwing away garbage, one of the workers (he looked like the owner) held open the garbage opener so it was easier to throw away the trash. Little acts of kindness always make my day. I also saw him checking in with people at their table to see if they needed anything. 

This place is located in small plaza with which which, the habit, and flame broiler. There is also an abundance of parking spaces, which is a plus!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Compared to the pizza press in Orange, this location is not up to par.  While there are still a bunch of good draft beers on tap (about 20 of them), the pizza was pretty bad.  The crust was kind of burnt, the sauce was not good (especially the spicy red sauce, which tasted like salty chinese garlic sauce instead of tomato sauce), and the seating felt a bit cramped.  Although the service was good, I'll probably have to rank this location below similar places like Pieology, Blaze, and even the Pizza Press in orange.  The pizza just wasn't good.

3 stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First off, white sauce is the BEST so get that! Customize your own pizza with UNLIMITED (yes I said it!) toppings for about $8. Or $6 customized salad (I think) for you healthy peeps!

They have a bunch of toppings: all sorts of cheese, veggies, meats, sauce, and dipping sauce at the end. My personal favs are: white sauce, pepperoni, chicken, mozz cheese, tomato, garlic, spinach, shrooms, and ranch on the side . They place your pizza in this oven/fire lookin thing and viola! Your mouth-watering thin crust pizza creation is served. 

Cute theme just like their other locations: print press vintage-y feel! Plenty of seats even for a small place. It's smaller than the Orange branch but bigger than the one in Anaheim. Show you student ID for discounts if the offer is still going on. Pizza Press never disappoints!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hmm I must say this place has fresher and a more variety of toppings compared to Pieology and Blaze. I noticed that my pizza looked smaller than the others, but it should be the same size dough. I didn't make a big deal about it. The Pizza Press cooks their pizzas in a conveyer belt oven, compared to the fast fired like the other pizza places. You can tell by the way it's cooked!

I really liked it! The crust was crispy and thin! I still wouldn't give this 5 stars yet because of the service. The cashier shouldn't be the one handling the money with one hand and taking out pizzas with the other hand at the same time. This place also opens late and sells beer! Must try!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Trying out this place for the first time.

Came here around 2pm today and only one customer in front of me.  But it still took me 20 mins to get my pizza. 

I ordered build your own pizza.  $8 
The toppings are better quality than Pieology.  The pepperoni tastes better here.  

I also got the garlic cheese bread. It was very good too.  

I gave it 3 stars because they are very slow here. The other thing I did not like was the cashier was same the person who cut your pizza and  packed it.  They should have someone who handle the money and not handle the food as well.  The cashier was wearing gloves but he was doing both jobs with the same gloves.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A new Pizza Press opened up by CSU Fullerton off the 57 freeway and Yorba Linda. This place is going with the Chipotle style pizza making, like Pieology down the street and Blaze Pizza a little further down. As you enter, the format of the eating area is a little hard to view the menu before the pizza makers start asking you what you want. You're greeted by some bottled drinks as well, as you put your pizza together, and then at the end you're bombarded with a huge selection of draft beers. Sorta yay but makes no sense yay.

It's kind of interesting that this particular pizza place chose not to use a pizza oven, just used a regular oven... That being said, the ingredients must be fabulous and they were impressive, but the dough on the pizza was so thin it became a cracker... With cheese and toppings on it.

Considering you only go to a particular pizza place for their crust, not the pepperoni or cheese, then I would have to say that this place... Meh. The marketing was really good in the store, loved the ambiance and decor, but the food itself just wasn't doing it for me. I'd recommend the two competitors over this one.

But draft beer, that's pretty awesome. But no TVs. Decide who you are, Pizza Press.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location is right across from Cal State Fullerton! 

The theme resembles that of an old school printing press where pizza is served on paper that looks like newspaper and all the set combo pizzas are named after real life newspaper publishers. 

The pizza process is similar to places like Blaze or Pieology: pick a premade pizza or "publish your own." Since it was the grand opening and they were giving away free pizzas, I decided to get a little bit of everything on top! 
 
The pizza was really good! I liked the crust here  because it came out golden brown and not overly charred like other places. On a regular day, the pizza will run you anywhere from $6-10 depending on what you get.

 Customer service was very nice and attentive! Their beer selection was over the top as well! Nice list of craft beers to go well with your pizza. I will definitely be coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I missed the opening of Pizza Press while in Orange, so when this place by Operator Mr. Hon opened, I made sure I stopped for a visit.  So yes, the them of this place is like that of a Operator/Press/Typing locale. You will find newspaper type paper under the pizzas and you see typewriter theme throughout the store.  This is my 1st experience with the Pizza Press. 

I have to say, if you like your crust crunchy, they've got this pat down. The crust is on the thinner side and even eating the day after being toasted, it still has the crunchiness texture. However, the sauce and the cheese here were very skimpy. I mean, my pizza was really thirsty for more sauce and more cheese. It was on the drier side because I don't load up on ingredients since I came with my kids who (like most kids) only gets cheese. 
They do have extra sauce at the end , feel free to ask for one in those black containers. 

The other thing was, the girl that was cutting the pizzas had a little bit of a shaky hand and was not fast enough. One of my pizzas were cut kids style with about 12 pieces while my other pizzas were cut 6 pieces. Strange, but part of the problem was because the place was so loud, it's very difficult to talk by the cashier. 

Other than that, I think this place would do great for the quick bite crowd for the CSU Fullerton crowd.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This restaurant is a cute alternative to Pieology or Blaze pizza that caters to a niche crowd of people who like what the other two restaurants have to offer but are also looking for a gastropub type setting.

Everything as far as the pizzas are concerned are the same as the other two restaurants except they have their signature pizzas that are named after newspapers in order to fit their theme. 

They sell beer and IPA that's seasonal or new and they let you sample it before you buy it which is convenient so that you don't end up with a full glass of something you don't like.

They sell other things in their refrigerated section. I tried their pasta salad and it was good, but tasted more creamy than I was expecting for a pasta salad.


#72/100<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pizza is good! There is a short menu with some of their own pizza recipes, you can build your own, or you can take one of their recipes and adjust it to your taste at the price of the build your own (price is reasonable, about $8 for your own pizza.) The crust is fairly thin, probably so it can cook quickly, and the toppings are fresh! A lot of craft beer options from breweries like Modern Times, Green Flash, Drakes, Firestone Walker... errrm can't remember what else I saw but they are on TapHunter if you take your beer seriously and want to see. Note: this is not a bar setting so please do us all a favor and don't come here to get drunk. 

All that being said about the food and beer, my favorite  thing about this Pizza Press is the music they play!! I don't know who is in charge of it, or if its like this at all Pizza Press locations, but it's seriously the best, most chill music to eat your pizza to. If you like the atmospheric/dreamy/chill kind of electronic music (like Odesza, Big Wild, Flume, etc) you should dine-in :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ranking...
1. Pizza Press
2. Blaze
3. Pieology

Something about this chain... I don't know if it is the ingredients or staff or both, but it is consistently delicious regardless of location. The pizza comes out crispy and they have plenty of sauces to choose from such as, bbq, ranch, pesto, sriracha, and more as a last minute final touch.  

Also, they have a wide selection of beer on tap!

Overall:
Recommend! Give it a try, you won't regret it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pizza was delicious! But ordering the food was ridiculous. Two female blonde employees (should have asked for their names) would not stop gossiping in front of my friend and I. We had to wait for them to stop talking at least 4 times in order for us to continue telling them what we wanted on our pizzas. I asked her to add only a little jalapeño and onion but she continued to douse the pizza with both toppings. I love this place but those two turn the whole experience upside down.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Honestly, they have one of the best vegan pizzas! I built my own pizza, I added the Daiya Vegan Cheese & topped it with balsamic vinegar. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!! I want to go back and try other things on their menu. I really love that you are able to choose what you want & everything is freshly made.  I am truly a fan & I really hope they open up more locations in LA! Service was great too!

</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't give out five stars very often but this is one of the few places that deserves it. I've been coming to pizza press since its earlier years at the location near Disneyland. I've always been blown away by the quality of the ingredients offered it all makes for a better pizza. 

After a few visits I figured out the perfect pizza for myself. I experimented with all sorts of toppings until I found that killer combo that suits me. At first the options were intimidating but soon enough I ventured out into trying out some not so traditional combinations. Thank god I did because it enhanced the experience overall.

The Fullerton location was a god send since I live in Brea and I couldn't often make it to the one by Disney. Instead I had to settle for Pieology which I will say is good but not on the level of Pizza Press. PP is top tier pizza and to top it off they have a killer selection of wonderful exotic beers from all around, which are constantly on rotation. 

I didn't think it was possible but this location has managed to Mimic the killer service and quality offered at the original. I'm actually a vegetarian as of the recent few months and this place still delivers with an unrivaled high quality cheeses and veggies.

This is by far one of the best pizzas I've had in my life and I've done a bit of traveling. I can say with confidence that this is most likely the best pizza in Orange County, perhaps even the whole state.

Only thing they don't have which I wish they would offer is a wheat based pizza just for those watching who are dieting. Top notch pizza and it's open till midnight on the weekends. I dare you to find another place this late that rivals them in quality and freshness.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Super friendly staff. 

The pizza is always perfection. I love fresh basil on mine. 

We noticed that the pricing here is slightly lower than the location across from Disneyland. That was a pleasant surprise. It also has more seating available.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">--------------------------------------------------
ESSENTIAL TIPS & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
--------------------------------------------------
# You'll find The Pizza Press inside University Plaza and next door to The Habit, Flamebroiler, and Which Wich. 

# The rating is close to 5 stars only because it's only week after the grand opening and as usual, family, friends, and fans skew the stars in the beginning. 

# The lines are long during lunch time because they're really new. I'd advise to call in and go straight to the cash register after elbowing your way through the people blocking the door. 

# Craft beer game here is strong. I posted pictures of the most recent draft list and I always appreciate a place that offers good beer to complement pizza, the most beer-friendly and stereotypical food item. Gotta get that beer belly on, bro.

# Another fast casual pizza place...I know. In our area, the familiar names in this category are Pieology and Blaze Pizza. They're in the same price bracket and deliver a similar product. While you would think Pizza Press would hold up to the competitors, unfortunately it does not.

# The pizza here makes for a decent lunch, but I'd seek out a different fast casual pizza place if I had other choices (which I do). The pizza prices are fair and range from $6-9 before tax. Each personal pizza is a good size that's plenty for lunch. You may want to restrict yourself to eating half of your pie so you don't eat 1000 calories haha

# What's wrong with the pizza? I got The Herald after reading up on the ingredient list and upon first glance, it looked tasty. I took several bites and felt neutral, neither good or bad. There wasn't much flavor from white sauce or the grilled chicken breast so the pizza was rather plain. 

The worst part of the pizza was the crust. It had a chewy flexible crust that was bread-like rather than crispy like you get in thin-crust pizzas. Actually, it's not crispy at all. I was able to skin the pizza alive by ripping the bottom part of the crust off (picture provided). Unless the crust is fulfilling, I'm not going to eat most of it. I'm going to save half of the calories per slice by ripping off the rubber-like bread at the bottom. 

The crust really reminded me of the first slice on a loaf of bread. Yes the one that's completely brown on one side. Remember how everyone avoided that slice and went for the regular white slices? It's like the Pizza Press is putting toppings on a thin version of that first, brown slice. And that slice happens to embody similar characteristics to what I described...chewy, dry, and rubbery with hints of brown toasting.

--------------------------------------------------
MY EXPERIENCE:

I talked enough and illustrated all of my points so I'll be silent in this section.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">~ Avg $6 Beer on Tap
$9 Pizza, Unlimited Toppings
$4.50 Tiramisu

Better than Pieology because you don't have to ask for extra crust cooking time. Their ingredients are always looking freshest and the staff are pretty baller. Pretty flavorful; this and the unlimited topping pizza place at Bella Terra are my two favorites when it comes to this style of being served.

Don't get the tiramisu. Nothing special about it, except the glass cup it comes in. Very strange, seriously.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">In a nutshell - hipster Pieology. 
Punny interior decor and super friendly workers make Pizza Press one of my top choices. A wider variety of options (both food and drank) make it a little more desirable than its bajillion competitors. 
Located extremely conveniently for CSUF students! Would definitely recommend if you have a gap in between classes and are deciding on a meal. If I lived in the area I'd choose Pizza Press over Pieology anyday!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great place; Friendly staff and DELICIOUS pizza. What more could you need?

Also, this location is so much better than the one across the street from Disneyland, IMO.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place could have been located next to the legendary and now burned down Dillon's Irish Pub, which was also once the Cantina Lounge. RIP to both! Jk I never went to Dillon's, which I am still bitter about.

GOOD
Very good pizza for a place that is competing with several pizza chains in the area, most notably Pieology. Advantages include being the closest to the University (better than the on campus Roundtable) and unlimited toppings. Nice beer tap selection that rotates often, so if you wanted to, you can come here for the beer alone. Place closes at midnight which is nice for the college students who study late. Servers are polite and are patient with you as you decide among the several toppings.

BAD
There isn't much downside really to this place. I guess the overwhelming amount of add-ons make you wonder about the quality of the ingredients. There's a chance that ingredients may fall into other ingredient containers when they are piling stuff onto your pizza, like most other serving stations do. I am nit-picking though.

I would recommend getting the pink sauce if you are horribly indecisive like me. getting the best of both world in mixing the red and white sauce. Have fun! Be Safe! Don't be racist.

AND oh yeah, the shift lead who also serves pizza likes to sing super loud. Sometimes making up his own jingles while you create your order. You've been warned.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Disappointing when comparing to the other "flash" pizza places like Pieology, Blaze and MOD. Sorry Pizza Press, but you're in fourth place........<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay, so Ive been in more than a few times since my last review, most recently about a week ago.

The food is still great, zero problems with that.

But last week the guy who took my pizza out of the oven tore off a good size piece of the edge of the pizza when he jammed the spatula thing underneath. Clearly he missed because it took off part of pizza!! As he was boxing it up I asked "what happened to my pizza?" And he said something like "oh, the crust got baked into the oven blah blah blah." Okay whatever, but I stood there and watched you assault my pizza!!

So I take my pizza and head to the soda machine. As Im there, the guy who was behind me in line said to me "They definitely dont have it together tonight." And I asked him what he meant by that. And he replied "That guy broke your pizza and then gave you that bullshit thing about the oven." THANK YOU STRANGER FOR ALSO WITNESSING WHAT HE DID TO MY PIZZA!

Nonetheless, I took my pizza home and ate it. It was good, just was missing about a 3" x 1" piece. 

I just wish that the guy wouldve been more upfront about it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Pizza Press is similar to Pieology and Blaze.  Kinda like Chipotle style but in a pizza ordering process.  This place is located right off the 57 freeway near Cal State Fullerton.  The service is very friendly and has a cool newspaper/ press decor theme.  Once inside, you choose your sauce, cheese and toppings.  They have a special machine to press the dough.  They use fresh ingredients and the pizza is delicious!!!  You can order their pre made pizza or "publish" your own. I saw some desserts on the menu but haven't tried any yet.  Just a tip:  If you check in on Yelp, you get a free soda!  Bye bye Pieology!  The Pizza Press is where it's at!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love pizza. I mean, I LOVE PIZZA. This place has the most topping choices out of all the pizza places out nowadays. I mean, smoked gouda, aged cheddar, AND chimichurri sauce? Yeah, they pretty much got their topping game covered. 

Loved the ambience of the place, cool fixtures, and their early 1900's decor.

Couple things that I disliked about the place: 

 - they use the conveyor belt oven; the crust came out chewy but had no significant crunch to it. Other places use ceramic ovens and each pizza has its individual amount of time to be cooked. So if you have a lot of toppings, I might come out a little under cooked. 
- it took a little bit longer for my pizza to come out but luckily it wasn't busy enough to affect the flow. I can only imagine how long it would take if it was busy.

For what it's worth, it was a great experience and their FOH (front of house) staff was very friendly and accommodating. Definitely would come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">4 Stars for the taste, 1 star for a bad first impression. 

Came in here with the girlfriend and we decided to build our own pizza. I instantly regretted building our own pizza because the guy who was helping us (with spiky earrings) kept talking to every worker who passed by him. He kept replying with a "what?" after we had requested our next topping one after the other. It was soooo frustrating... On top of that he kept talking about how "stress-free" his job is and he kept comparing it with his previous jobs. Alright man, we get it. Its a chill job, but when there are only three customers in the entire store, the least you could do is give them your full attention and cater to them. 

Food was pretty bomb though, but cant say it is better than pielogy. I didnt see any difference.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to the one in Orange and really enjoyed it. This place wasn't as crowded since most students were off on winter break. Pizza Press in comparison to Pieology, has better quality ingredients. Pizza tasted great. Another plus is that they serve lots of different craft beers on tap. I'm glad this place is close. Service was friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have to start by saying, I absolutely love the concept. Pizza press, like a news press! Old fashion styled, printing presses, the décor of old movable type blocks on the shelves, black and white photos on the wall and an printing press like designed oven, all of it pretty cool. Obviously, the ordering concept is similar to Pieology with a slight twist. You can add different sauces which I really enjoyed. A lot of it is very much like Pieology, I think what really sets this place up nicely is that the crust is crispier, which I definitely like. You can't go wrong with pizza and they do a really nice job, I think what really makes this place worth coming to is the atmosphere, you get this old school feel. I like just sitting in there feeling like I'm at an 1930s pizza parlor. Really cool place, I highly recommend.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My roommate and her bf always came here and recommended it to me so I decided to try it out with my boyfriend late one night.  The workers were so welcoming and friendly, even in the late hour of the night. It was our first time and they explained everything well. It is self explanatory how they operate, but knowing the different options are always interesting.

I picked one of the signature pizzas as a starting base which you can customize as well. You can take away toppings you don't want and also add however many you want with NO EXTRA CHARGE! It goes through the conveyer belt oven and when it comes out on the other side, it is perfectly cooked. The bread is thin, but also soft and you can add any sauce or put it on the side. They even reminded me of the free drink I could get when I checked in on Yelp!

All in all, great experience and will definitely come back.

Tips:
-if you want spinach on your pizza, put in on first so it does not sit on the top and burn. Great service points in which she told me this tip and put oil on top so mine wouldn't burn in the oven and it came out perfect.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location is HUGE compared to the harbor location but still has the same fresh ingredients and wonderful service! The dinner area is clean and kept up well. The sofa fountain counter was also very well kept. I will be returning to enjoy my favorite pizza customizing spot!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best pizza ever! Also workers are so funny and nice!  They have some great costumer service !!! Pretty cheap, very clean, food is amazing!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As far as the food, this place is amazing!! The best make your own pizza place out there. Blows pieology and mod pizza away.

What makes this place so good is that it is so fresh and you can taste the quality. I've been here 3 times now and each time the pizzas have been great. 

The customer service could use some improvement. I came here once when it was pretty busy and the lady who made my pizza was very slow with the orders and disregarded the fact that the line was getting so long due to her working so slowly. Another time I came here I was charged for 2 pizzas instead of 1. The mistake was fixed and I was refunded the money but could tell the guy was annoyed and sensed a bit of an attitude when I asked him kindly  to explain his mistake and to give me the right amount of change. He made the whole thing confusing and then was annoyed when I wanted clarification.  Don't make a mistake and then get mad at the customer for wanting you to explain yourself. 
Other than that, the food is great. It isn't too cheap. I'd say it's a bit on the pricey side for being a typical broke college student.

I will be coming back regardless of the customer service being mediocre. The pizza here is outstanding and that wins in my book. Would've given 5 stars but the customer service brought it down to 4.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is yummy and staff is super friendly.

BEWARE OF THE ARUGULA!!!  The sorriest, limpest, most scraggly arugula I have ever seen.  800 Degrees executives would mock this ceaselessly.

Other than that, yum.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite pizza place. 
Conveniently located across from the CSUF campus. 
The pizzas are nicely priced and absolutely delicious (if you know what you're putting in it!)
I also love the rotating selection of beer. The staff are knowledgable about beer and will make you a good recommendation.

Will return again.  And again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You know what been wanting to try this place for a couple weeks finally was able to. They have a great staff with great pizza. They have Fullerton student offers which is great because hey who doesn't need to save a couple bucks. They are a really nice group happy to support this business.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I tired this place out for lunch today with a friend. I really like the design of the place and how they have lots of old pics from what looks like the 1920's. There was lots of seating and they had bench seats that were like couches to comfortably done at!

I had a make my own pizza which I had them add, pepperoni, bourbon bacon, mozzarella cheese, feta cheese, green peppers, green onions and basil and pesto dressing after it was done cooking. I must say, this is an amazing combination if you want to try what I had!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location never disappoints food wise the ingredients always super fresh distributed properly cooked perfectly without being burned the proportion of the crust and the thickness of cut/chop of the ingredients is better than other similar places where it's not evenly cooked without being gooey/burnt they have the cooking temp down here! The guys that work here are super cool and helpful always greet you the girls not so much downside always dirty and they need napkins on the table especially in a pizza joint I come here frequently it's delicious!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Who's the winner in the epic battle of pizzas in Fullerton?  Pieologoy vs Pizza Press?

CRUST - Winner: Pizza Press - Something about it just makes the pizza's taste profile better.  Pieology crust is pretty bland....just a vehicle for the ingredients.  The crust at pizza press really stands out.  Crisp and fresh.  Although, I don't believe Pizza Press has a wheat option.

CHEESE - Winner: Pieology - I think the cheese at Pieology tastes better.  For starters, Pizza Press was out of Gorgonzola.  I've never seen Pieology be out of any ingredient.  The worst part about Pizza Press cheese is that they use the weird tiny little mozzarella pieces....reminds me of my elementary school's boxed cafeteria pizza that had half-melted cheese.  It's fine once melted, but looks like the opposite of appetizing when it's put on the pizza.  Pizza Press has goat cheese if you're into that sort of thing.

MEAT: Winner: Pizza Press - The Italian Sausage is king of all meats. Get it.

VEGGIES: Pieology's veggies seem to taste more fresh (may be because of the way they're baked)....you'll have to try it out and see for yourself.  

CRAFT BEER & SODA: Pizza Press.  Where's the beer, Pieology?  Pizza Press has a healthy selection of rotating beers from local and major craft breweries.  Some of it is really too expensive, though.  They also have a fridge of bottled craft beer and soda when you first walk in

PORTION SIZE: Pieology hands-down.  I don't even have to ask them for anything extra.  If you get a lot of ingredients, you will get a lot of food. You have to really ask for more at Pizza Press.

SERVICE: Pieology.  It's a well-oiled machine.  Pizza Press can take while  Less employees and the pizza is cooked while you're in line.  They've gotten better though.  Also, Pieology once lost some of the ingredients of my pizza in the oven, and they offered to remake it.  When I declined, they gave me three free pizza coupons!  This was at the Irvine location.

HOURS: Pizza Press is open til 12?  Hell yeah!

AMBIANCE: Pizza Press - Nice and quiet outdoor area and relatively quieter indoor area.  I never like to eat at the Fullerton Pieology.  Pizza Press is the one to go to if you're with friends.

DESERT: Do they sprinkle crack on Pieology's cinnamon sugar bread?  Pretty sure they do.

OVERALL TASTE: Pizza Press!  Something about it is just so delicious.  Everything goes together really well, and I don't feel like I'm in a food coma afterwards.  Overall less salty than pieology and definitely less greasy.  Pizza Press is the winner here in my book. 

OVERALL WINNER: Both!  There will be people who like one or the other.  Myself, I enjoy both.  I end up going to Pizza Press more often simply because they're open later.  

Either way, I'll be happy to be eating a delicious pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been to Pieology and Blaze, this place is different.... and BETTER!

The thing with Pieology, their pizza is a bit oily and the crust is burnt 98% of the time. Same goes to Blaze but a tad less.

The place looks good. Nice design and a comfortable environment for everyone.

The Pizza Press utilizes a belt style cooking (In lack of proper words) which goes in through one end and perfectly cooked on the other.

They do have their own pizza recipe but allow customization as well.

They have beer here. I'm not a drinker, so go drink on your own and find out. People seemed to like it though.

Overall, I was very satisfied with the food with great customer service as well!

I'll be visiting soon... very SOON!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can never go wrong with pizza! Let me say I love the whole food assembly line now a days, it's so convenient. Usually I go to Pizza Studio since that's in my area but recently was in Placentia and came over here to try it out. Really great choices for toppings and love how it's unlimited. I do wish they had different flavored dough like Pizza Studio, but hey that's just me nitpicking lol but this place is the best pick for the area! Totally recommend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There is one worker who is just so outgoing and friendly and made me feel so welcome. He could probably carry the store on it's own if we were just going off a good personality.

The pizza was perfect. My mom and I shared a pizza with half of her toppings and half of mine (chicken and spinach). I can't finish a ton of food, so I was glad that the pizza was thin crust and skinny. I ate two slices and took the rest home. I'll be coming back and trying the pesto topping that my mom had!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's pretty good. Got the napoleon something pizza. Flavors just fit so well and the acidity of the cheese just put the pizza on a whole nother level. And cheap. Yumyum<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is pretty good. I love Pieology, but man is it a far distance to walk. Being right in front of the campus makes it so much better. They also serve BEER! This place will be staying awhile. 

My creation: Pink sauce, garlic, chicken, bacon with veggies. Pesto and Sriracha on half of each!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay this is my second time coming here  I love even my 6 year old daughter  the greatest customer service ever and omg the pizza it's too dye for I love it<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza press has awesome pizza, sauces and toppings! Decent price with fun happy staff! I'd recommend these personal pizzas to anyone!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza press surely never disappoints. 

Third open in Orange County and just as amazing as the other two locations!

Small restaurant, may have some long lines, but they're always speedy and it's perfect for CSUF students grabbing a bite between classes!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good pizza, just how i liked it but slighltly burnt... not crispy but burnt. Still enjoyed my meal though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wonderfully delicious!  Fresh ingredients, good selection of brews for a little pizza place by Cal State Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place surprised me... Pizza was really tasty, the workers were all super friendly and they are open late!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza Press is definitely newsworthy!!
The concept is fairly new but with a theme twist that gives it a unique ambiance. The crust is golden light, and they offer a great selection on toppings that can be simple and fast, yet gives you the freedom to be creative.
If you cannot decide, try the Tribune, or the Chronicle, they are both flavorful.
The restaurant has a clean, modern and energetic feel, and their customer service is superb.
Worth checking out what the buzz is all about and getting a pizza hot off the press.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was really excited to hear they were opening another pizza place near CSUF. The place is clean with a good amount of room. If you bring a big party, it would be hard to find seats if the place is crowded. The guy who helped me out was nice. 

I customized my own pizza. For the base layer, I got the spicy red sauce. I don't think it was spicy at all. He gave me a good amount of pepperoni and bacon. I'm sad that he did not put a lot of artichokes or spinach. I love their crust, so crispy and delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is so delicious! You can choose from the menu or make your own pizza. I could see how this place is similar to pieology but it's cheaper and in my opinion it tastes better! The pizza tastes fresh and from my experience the employees have always been friendly. If you're a pizza kind of person then this should be your new spot. They also have a wide variety of beers on tap!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not happy with my visit. Although our pizza girl was nice, my bill for 2 build your own $8.25 pizzas was $23.22. No where on the menu does it say VEGAN CHEESE is extra $1 or GLUTEN FREE pizza bread is extra $2. But the girl working kept promoting it so my boyfriend and I decided to try it out. Once we were already at the register and paid we asked why we got charged so much since there was no receipt given to us either (-.-)And they were just like it's extra charge at pieology too. Didn't you know? Wth?? 

Obviously not. I would've just gone with my normal bread and normal mozzarella cheese pizza. Usually you're supposed to tell the customer that and apologize for the charge too and waive it or something. 

Horrible menu. Bad service. Decent pizza. 

Not happy with my experience. Will go to Pizza Studio or Pieology instead where their workers and menu are much clearer.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down to the place. The service is friendly, quick, and delicious. The price that we paid for our create your own is much better then project pie in San Diego. You must try  it's worth every penny.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First I just want to say I wrote this review not only cuz I loved it but mostly because the guys in front of me/sitting next to me were just bashing everything. From how insufficient their sauce brush to the trash cans and hallways.... It was all actually amazing, no need for negative Nancy's.  So I wanted to make sure this place got the reviewed it deserved. 

I got chose a pizza off the signature menu "The Herald" I added bacon, and topped it off with basil, rosemary and olive oil. It was delicious not too much sauce and was crust perfectly crispy. I liked it way better then their competitor Pieology, not to to mention their location is convenient for CSUF students like myself. Extra plus they offer a CSUF student discount! 

They have a decent sized craft menu for those interested. If I wasn't in the middle of classes I would have tried out one of their tasty craft beers. They also offer some bottled root beers, and water. 

Service was amazing I was asked by nearly everyone worker how I was doing, and how my meal was. They even have free ranch :)

Suggestions 
I see this place getting more popular and just to handle a larger crowd, perhaps giving customers numbers coordinated with numbers on mini popsicles sticks on pizza. This way seated customers can delivered their pizza's without confusion. P.S they do deliver pizza to tables but just a suggestion for an increase in traffic.  

Overall amazing will definitely be returning :))))<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ohhhhh yesssss. A pizza spot within walking distance of CSUF? Check. Gluten free crust? Check. VEGAN cheese? Chiggity check. Pies better than the rest? You bet, checkkkkkk. TAKE MY MONEY<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have to say this is most definitely one of my top favorite make your own pizza places. My friend has nagged me for weeks to come here and I'm so glad I did! Staff is very friendly! The pizza is amazing! I'm a fan of the conveyor belt oven since it is quick and there's no need of cornmeal (like Pieology). Perfectly cooked pizza and just delicious!  Also really liked the theme of the restaurant and the atmosphere Will definitely be coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in tonight...the air was on thank you God. Great atmosphere and the food was amazing. I got a create your own with the pink sauce, mozzarella, spinach, roasted garlic cloves and cherry tomatoes. After baking a swirl of the pesto...almost orgasmic it was so good. Pricing was great and the staff were all super friendly. We will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Customer service here is always awesome! Jordan welcomed me and Erin helped me through everything. Everything is fresh and you can make your own pizza exactly the way you want. There are so many options here so you can really go crazy. Make sure to try the cookies they are to die for! And there are lots of beer options.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I seriously love this place. Like every time I come here, the staff greet you like you came home from a long day at work. I usually get a customized Harold and everytime I take a bite from each pizza I order, it's like heaven blessed you with happiness. I've been to Blaze and Pieology and they ain't got nuttin on Pizza Press. Honestly if I wasn't so worried about calories, I would seriously eat here everyday. Just check this place and you won't be sorry.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely at the top of my list if I want something delicious, quick & with more then within a reasonable price. Plus to add the friendly staff always greeting as you enter & leave & never ending beer list, highly recommend the stumptown cold brew coffee too if you need a pick me up for class with some ice on the side (: ! with more then enough sauces & toppings to pick from, it did get easier as I went more, so don't get too overwhelmed your first time. if you get there early enough as well you can most likely get a fresh baked cookie or tiramisu to go with the stumptown cold brew, best combo ! 

-besides the constant Titan deals you can get through out the month (:<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very good pizza. I am a pizza lover and I have eaten every kind of pizza there is so I thought I would give this place a try. 

I got the build you're own pizza. Pepperoni sausage and bacon. The taste was very good. Crispy like the way I like it. 

What disappointed me was their limited meat selection. They don't have hamburger beef, meatballs or Salami. Those have to be there to have a true meat lovers pizza. This is where Pieology beats them on. They have these meats there. As well as Blazin Pizza  

Just about all the other ingredients they have. 

But how this place beats out Pieology and Blaze is is the cheese is put on better and tastes better. The cheese isn't just thrown on like other places but the cheese here is more compact and well places so it doesn't fall off. 

Plus their crust here is better than other places. Their customer service and friendly service is also great as well. Definitely very good pizza and will come back. 
Prices are also reasonable. 


Hopefully they get the other meats so I can have the full pizza I really like.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The concept is the same as Pielogy and Blaze Pizza. 
I honestly prefer Pielogy. I feel like Pizza Press is on the healthier side. Not sure if it was just the person behind the counter who gave me only a bit of oil, but the pizza is too dry for my taste, but it still tastes good. It's pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pizza was great and I like that they have a lot of beers on tap all of them are craft beers too. Right by campus is good for a snack between classes and if you want a beer because the pub is always closed. I think they have wifi too<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm from Antioch CA -7 hours away. 
Best pizza ever! Took less then 5 min to make and staff super friendly. Amazing how great it tasted.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fun & friendly service. This is the second Pizza Press I've been to and it is just as good as the first one I went to. The people running the pizza line are a little stingy with the toppings but if you ask them to put more, they are more than willing to. Very patient staff, and some of the best pizza I've ever had. It's now the only pizza place I go to because I LOVE the thin crust, and the price is pretty good for what you get. Everything is super fresh and clean. I rarely ever crave pizza but when I do, The Pizza Press is where I'll be going from now on. It's open late and they have many locations near me so very convenient!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here last Wednesday afternoon, and I was greeted by this funny man working that day! He was awesome and had the best jokes! When you walk in he would be like welcome to you sir, you sir, and you miss. Right after they got in some people left and he said good bye to you sir and you sir. I don't know why i thought this was so funny, but this guy had such good vibes. It made the whole place just lighten up just because you could feel his energy, while getting business done, he knew how to have a good time at work while making the customers laugh. This place needs more workers like him, and also I use to hate pizza until now! Especially growing up on microwave pizza all my life, I think I am slowly liking pizza again!

Thanks Pizza Press!

Tips
Get the publish your own ( which means you can customize your pizza and add whatever you want to it) I mean whatever you want so go to town on it! Just don't over do it or else it might cook unevenly. 
Don't go during peak hours or else you might be waiting for a while. 12 to 3pm. 

Tips to business owner
As a business major, if people ask for to go boxes when they are eating here and can't finish, you should buy the white blank containers to save money. I see you guys giving out a whole pizza box for just one or two slices. This might save you guys a little money. 

You guys should offer CSUF discounts, I don't know if you guys already do but if you did I have been missing out! 

I don't if you guys have happy hour for alcohol but please do so I can get hammered before going to class. Just kidding.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best pizza always!!! Tonight I came in looking for pizza press worker Joseph but apparently he "wasn't working" ?
And just when we thought all hope was lost, Coby pulled thru for my team and me! 
Keep it up pizza press. Rip to our fav worker Emmy who transferred to a different job, you are dearly missed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great concept. Great interior decor. Friendly staff. Gluten free crust available. Good beer selection. 

However- understaffed, space too small and burnt pizza. 

Would definitely come again to give it another go.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thought I'd give this place a try and I was not disappointed! The line was short, great selection of toppings, free drink with check-in, and most importantly a yummy pizza :) Granted I've only been here once, but it was a good experience. Pretty affordable too, it's at that pieology, chipotle, panera bread level.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Pizza Press does it again!

I fell in love at the Orange location, have since made sure to enjoy my usual at the Anaheim location every time I go to Disneyland (which is quite often) and am now a frequenter of the Fullerton spot when I'm in the area. Hands down my favorite pizza joint and they have the best craft beer too.

Highly recommend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There have been tons of restaurants just like this popping up. Pieology, Blaze, Pizza Studio, Pizza Rev, the list goes on...

When compared to the others, this was one of my top picks. This is why:

I loved the theme. The whole pun on "press" is clever and created a great ambiance. The pizza as done in just a few minutes, and came out just as good as if it was in longer (I was pretty surprised). They had a great variety of toppings and sauces that I LOVED. Overall, it was a very satisfying experience.

I'll be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came in here with a friend on a Friday afternoon around 2:30pm. It wasn't really that packed which was nice, since that allowed for ample amount of seating and quiet enough to carry a conversation.  I really like the theme of the pizzeria. They have black and white pictures up with an old school typewriter in the front where you order. Their menu also follows the newspaper theme! Cute and creative. The only downside  was that when we went there were some flies flying around, which was annoying. But otherwise the place was clean.

Now to the actual food....honestly speaking my friend and I thought it was alright. It was on the cheesier  side  which neither of us was really a fan of. We got the Garlic Cheesy  Bread and The Chronicle Pizza. The garlic cheesy bread was really cheeesy, couldn't really taste anything else on it and the dipping sauce was ehh, kinda fell short of what I was expecting. The chronicle pizza was alright. Not something that would bring us back. It was mediocre. I am giving it 3 stars because while we found it too be too cheesy and slightly flavorless, it was horrible. It's a good meal, at a decent price. But I think my friend and I will be sticking to pieology for now.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A good place for CSUF students to grab a bite because it is within walking distance from CSUF.  As we were eating, the place started to get crowded at noon.  People were trying to find a place to sit and it is not a huge restaurant.  The pizza crust is thin just like Pieology.  You can make your own or pick one of the choices that they have on the menu.  It was my first time, so I picked the Tribune pizza, which had the specialty sausage, pepperoni, red peppers, and olives.  At the end, you can also add any sauces that you want on the top of your pizza.  The decorated theme of the place is like a newspaper and has a vintage touch.  Next time, I will try to the make your own pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is an AMAZING place for Pizza N Beer. Best combination under one roof. No joke. The pizzas are BOMB and you have options. Pieology is NOTHING compared to this place. You really have to come and check it out for yourself. Not only is it good, it's CHEAP! On a nice cold night if there's nothing to eat at home come here and enjoy nice warm pizza. Affordable and tasty. Can't get any better than THAT! Come on in and taste it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Amazing!! Waaay better than pieology (sorry love you guys too) 

Excellent selection of local craft beers that's always changing, probably because the kegs are tapped out due to the awesome prices!! As for the pizza, from the dough to the toppings much better, although I prefer pieology pepperonis, but the taste of this pizza was much better.

I made my pizza and I'm calling it the "Fat Matt":

Roasted garlic cloves
White sauce, spicy red sauce combo
Mozzarella balls, and regular mozzarella 
Pepperoni, bacon, jalapeños 

Bake it and topped off with pesto<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">New spot close to home so I decided to check it out. The concept of a build your own pizza is OK, I find it to be a little kitschy but whatever, I love pizza and I get to build my own and see it made right in front of me! 

Honestly nothing special but the ingredients that they used were fresh and just delicious. I also like the printing press theme, its cute and adds a different ambiance in a not-super-different-restaurant, with not super different food. 

So I don't like my pizza overly saucy but these gals kinda skimped on the sauces, I asked for a bit extra on my pizza. Bf did the same. Good amount of cheese and toppings. I liked that they weren't greasy at all. Pretty cool little spot. I'd definitely come here before some of the other "subway-pizza" places only because their craft beer list looked on point<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely love this place. Pizza is TOP NOTCH. Probably not the best judge of the pizza itself because I will always LOVE pizza, but it's actually one of my top choices. On top of great pizza, there's a great environment and staff is always so friendly! I love going in when Victor is working, he's always super nice and funny! Oh, and to top it all off, the cookies are AMAZING.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3 stars for the crust because it stayed firm and crispy, although it may be from the little splatters of sauce they put on. I guess being a hipster pizza place, tomato sauce isn't just sauce, it's art. 

I've read in a lot of the reviews about how great their customer service is and how they greet you right away, I unfortunately did not get that. It took them about 5 mins for them to even look in my general direction, and when they did, they kept talking to each other and going on about their day. When someone finally came to help me, I found it pretty difficult to order over the tall thick glass between us. I tiptoed down the line shouting which ingredients I wanted. 

Which leads me to another thing... I LOVE artichoke hearts, I mean LOOOOVE, so naturally I asked for extra artichoke hearts... instead of making it rain artichokes, he carefully peeled the already tiny bits of layers and slowly placed the even more tiny pieces on my pizza. He asked if I wanted more to which I replied yes and bless his little artichoke heart, he gave me a few more tiny ripped pieces. AWESOME. 

I will never betray you again PIEOLOGY. Please forgive me for I have sinned.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very nice themed restaurant, clean great service and the food is amazing.  Everything is really fresh and you must try the sweet linked sausage. This is my new favorite pizza place, better than blaze and better than everything in the area defiantly a must try. I will be back for sure<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm not sure why others suggest there is no difference between the pizza at this place and Pieology, Blaze, etc. While the concept is similar, the pizza is distinctly different. Since The Pizza Press uses a conveyer-belt type oven, the pizza crust is evenly cooked. It's still crispy but it doesn't taste like a cracker unlike its competitors. My party had three separate signature pizzas, and all were delicious. You can customize any pizza on the menu. 

We also ordered the garlic cheesy bread. It was a hit with our party. Our pizza press men were helpful and knew "their thing." If you're a pizza fan of the Pieology and Blaze variety, then you will love this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is awesome! When we went it wasn't very crowded. I'm sure during the weekday lunch rush it's probably busy with students. When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a super friendly, nice guy. I didn't catch his name, but he is excellent at his job. He made every customer that walked in feel welcome & was quite enthusiastic about his job. Now about the pizza - delicious!! I got spicy marinara, cheddar & mozzarella, red onion, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts & pepperoni. It tasted so good! It was totally affordable & a very pleasant dining experience. Kid friendly as well. We will definitely be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">In my opinion they have the BEST tasting pizza around wouldn't pick anywhere else!! I definitely recommend it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is beyond amazing! I would say it is similar to pieology but 1,000x better! For all you beer lovers it's a great place. I mean pizza and craft beers with a great selection!!! To top it off (pun intended) they have great employees that love what they do and provide you with great service. To the point wheree they let you try a few of the beers while you wait for it to cook! Make sure it's Tristan taking care of you especially. He made our first time coming here outstanding!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is bomb af!! They have great prices as well and are open all the fucking time !! It's walking distance from the UHs and the pointe as well<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I just happened upon this place as a recent grad of CSU Fullerton. I walked in and immediately noticed they had a pretty great selection of local craft brews on tap, then, much to my surprise they make a 100% vegan pizza! The ingredients are top notch everything is cooked fresh including the crust, The staff was super super nice. I will definitely come back here when I'm in the area again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I thought this place was a huge disappointment. Should have just gone to Blaze where I know I like the pizza.

First of all, the guy preparing my food was only wearing gloves half the time. I work with food for my job and I know how big of a no-no it is to not be wearing protective gloves when dealing with customers food. 

Two, the workers there seemed more interested in talking to each other than providing my friend and I with the bare minimum attention required to prepare our pizza.

Third, I didn't care too much for the conveyer-belt like oven system. I thought it resulted in a slightly burnt pizza.

Overall the taste of the pizza wasn't terrible, but i really have no lingering feeling to return to this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is like Blaze and Pieology.  You pick your ingredients and pay at the end of the line.  I do find the dough a bit spongy like it was made from some instant dough. I do like the interior decor.  It's less cafeteria looking than Pieology.  Overall, the three chains are all very similar.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the thin crust dough, the sauces and the many fresh ingredients that Pizza Press offers to build an amazing tasty pizza.  

The ambiance is cool.  The spot is clean and the staff is on point.  Thanks Guy for your suggestion on the pizza and your friendly service.  

We will be back again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't normally always write reviews, but after tonight, I have to give them a full 5 stars.

Yes, its slower to get your pizza than Pieology, but I would say the pizza is better. Yes, they have craft beers. 4 out of 4 music graduate students approve of the food and the beer.

But I really appreciate their customer service. My pizza came out a little burned on the top - it was still edible, but some toppings might be a little crispier. I didn't mention a thing since I'm not one to waste food. The cashier looks at my pizza and asks if I was in a hurry and I said, "no." And they remade the whole pizza, let me keep the one that was just a bit burnt on the top and I ate that one while I waited. They brought out the fresh pizza - unburned - and I didn't pay a single thing.

I appreciate the commitment to their product and I didn't have to mention a thing. They fixed it on their own. So bravo, Pizza Press, I'll definitely be coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love coming here when I'm at CSUF. The pizza is bomb and the staff are crazy in a good way... All entertaining.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I got "The Sun" pizza and it was so savory. The bacon, the ham, pineapple, are definitely my favorite toppings on a pizza. I love the different sauces they have. The place inside is super nice- very modern.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely love this place! Tried it out for the first time a week ago and I've already been back twice. Pizzas cost around $8, really reasonable and worth every penny. Lots of options for toppings, cheeses and sauces. Delicious! I like it better than pieology..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Go here. I mean, now. Get the keys to your four-dour sedan, drive down Nutwood, and behold the Pizza Press in all of its glory.

When you walk in the door, you are greeted with probably one of the most upscale environments that I have ever seen in a "fast casual" establishment. Even with CSUF students running amock, the floors are clean and the tables are well kept. The workers, making their pizzas behind a counter barricaded by glass, are all super friendly and conversational -- especially Erin. During your meal, some of the workers will ask you how your pizza is and make sure that your experience is top fucking notch. 

The food is structured the same way as Pieology or Blaze, but don't even compare those two restaurants to the Pizza Press. The pizzas here are better by a landslide and a half -- their toppings, their crust, and their sauces are all amazing. From my previous dining experiences, the crust is able to support a heavy amount of toppings without falling apart, so do not hesitate to stack that bitch up. 

The Pizza Press is affordable for a place with such a hipster vibe -- $8 for a single pizza, $9 for their vegan option. The place also serves those craft beers that everyone keeps talking about and some cool sodas. 

It's a nice place to chill and get buzzed with a couple of friends. This place deserves all the stars Yelp can give them.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I wish I had a lot of good things to say...

First off, coming into the restaurant, I wasnt greeted or anything but half-a**ed asked "what can I get you?" No eye contact? Cool..

Through the process, the lady helping said "what?!" To us quite rudely, even when we kept raising our voices so she can hear us, so like wtf man..? Then at the cashier, we asked for pesto sauce and the cashier looks around and was like "haha no sauce, that's a bummer." Lol what..? Couldn't have said "oh we don't have any available as of right now, sorry!" Like I think I would've liked that better...well I kinda don't even wanna eat anymore at this point..

The food: nicely baked, I suppose, everything was cooked through, but the portions are so small. Like the saucing wasn't even there after being baked, the pizza was quite dry. The meats were like a pinch of sprinkles here and there, and the veggies overflowed..I mean I guess veggies are least expensive but like uhhhhh...wtf. Biting into the pizza..god it was like drinking oil with a hint of dry dough. Very disappointed as people hyped it up a lot.

Probably won't be back. I'll stick to other pizza places around Fullerton/brea.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't let the long line discourage you! These guys are speedy. I love this place for make your own pizzas, when you can't decide on a topping with friends, or even picnics. I always describe it as a Subway for pizzas but with fresher ingredients. They offer so many great and unique toppings. I usually get every vegetable they offer with mozzarella balls and marinara, topped with basil, arugula, and rosemary. they even have vegan cheese and ricotta cheese. Pretty good price for what it is, only thin crust offered though. If you're lucky you can go in and see the guy who is really flamboyant and that always makes for an interesting visit at well lol<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza Press operates under the same concept as Pieology--choose from a small selection of pre-set pizzas or customize your own. Decor is equally hip & prices are comparable at $8 a pie, but a few details may help them trump Pieology in my book.

+ Their cheese selection. Gorgonzola, aged sharp cheddar, smoked gouda, chevre, feta, as well as all the ones you can get at Pieology. This place is definitely not for the lactose intolerant, unless you want to get the vegan cheese, which they actually have too.
+ Their sauce selection. You can choose red sauce, white sauce, spicy red sauce, or even PINK sauce for the base of your pizza, then go ham and add anything from sriracha to frank's red hot to chimichurri sauce on top.
+ Despite the aforementioned sauces, my crust came out crispy and nothing was dripping or sliding off--something that's never happened to me at Pieology.
+ Still serving cilantro & I love me lots of that!
+ Lastly, but almost just as important--their pizza boards make for much cooler IG backdrops

One drawback for you hardcore carnivores, their meat selection is more limited.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great pizza!  Thin crispy crust, several sauces and toppings to choose from.  Build your own custom pizza.  Will definitely be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has me coming back for more! Can't get enough. My kids love the jr. editor and the staff and owners always make me feel welcome!

 Thanks for making a great pizza!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The staff is really awesome first and for most. Cuz although the pizza might be amazing it's the staff that makes it soo much better which it does. 

The white sauce on ur pizza is the best!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place sucked, pizza was tasteless 
And I order good combination of toppings 
Not coming back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very Descent pizza,  of all the fast serving skinny crust pizza places... It's one of the best.  The restaurant was clean and the service was fast.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried the Pizza Press last night for the first time and was extremely impressed. I am a student at CSUF and had noticed it had opened not too long ago. I also heard they had a great craft beer selection. My boyfriend and I headed over there for dinner and arrived around 6:30 (on a sunday). Place was not too too busy, just a few people in line in front of us which we were stoked about because piologoly (the other make your own pizza place near by) usually has super long lines. After trying Pizza Press I am sure it wont be long till people line up around the corner to publish a pizza. Guess the word is still getting out. Definitely more than happy to show these guys some love on yelp. 

We both decided to "publish our own pizzas" $8 for a good sized pizza and whatever toppings you want. I got the spicy red sauce and olive oil, with garlic, sun dried tomatoes, both kinds of mozzarella cheeses, caramelized onions, bacon, chicken, roasted red peppers, red onions, arugula, cilantro, basil, pesto, and chimichurri sauce. I was a little ambitious with my toppings but I was so impressed with their selection I just had to try it all. It was so so so good!!! I loved their crust light and fluffy but still crispy at the edges. My boyfriend was also very pleased. He ate his entire pizza before I got through two pieces of mine and went back and ordered an order of cheesy bread. The cheesy bread was basically another smaller pizza because they still let you customize it however you'd like. 

They have an AWESOME craft beer selection. Many from local breweries, which i think it a very nice touch. They even had Bootleggers Golden Chaos, one of my favorite beers but I went with an IPA that the guy behind the register recommended to try something new. Did not disappoint, he also suggested a stout for my bf that he also loved. 

The staff was great and super accommodating to my over the top toppings on my pizza. Next time I think i'll keep it a little more simple but like I said I had to try it all! The decor was cute and fit with the old time newsy theme of the shop. They had a decent amount of seating but Im sure if I were to go during school it will be packed, as it should be. Can't wait to come back and publish some more pies! Thanks Pizza Press!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I tried this place for the first time yesterday and I fell in love with it! I used to be a big fan of Blaze Pizza, but I'm converted! The restaurant has the same concept as Blaze and Pieology but I felt like the quality of meats and veggies that Pizza Press offers completely destroys Blaze and Pieology. I am reviewing for the build your own pizza, as I have not tried anything else.

The service was great and the workers were super sweet. I love the interior design of this place too. I do have to say that the servings aren't as big as Blaze Pizza, but this place definitely worth the try! One of my favorite sauces is the pink sauce - a mix of their red and white sauce.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The service is always great, the staff always cracks jokes every time we go. Even gave us some Pokémon tips. They have the best pizza and ingredients are always fresh.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not only does the Pizza Press offer beyond delicious food, they also go above and beyond in their service which without a doubt sets them above the rest.
After receiving my pizza, I had to attend a meeting for about four and a half hours, so I wasn't able to eat the pizza right away.  However, after I finished my meeting and heated up my pizza, I was amazed at how fresh the pizza still tasted!  Usually when you reheat pizza, it ends up being rubbery and tasting stale.  However, the pizza from the Pizza Press tasted like it was still fresh out of the oven.  You can really tell that they use fresh, quality ingredients in their food which definitely stands out against places like Blaze Pizza and Pizza Studio.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely a good pizza place to go to in between classes. Everyone's very friendly, good beers, and overall a good ambience. They don't have as huge of a selection as Pieology or Blaze Pizza, but I'm not complaining. Their pink sauce is my favorite, it's a mix of their red sauce and white sauce. The service is a little slow, but that's to be expected when there's a huge line, especially because the employees take pride in their pizzas.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The grand opening was today. I had to check it out, especially with their rad deal for a free pizza! I always like to support neighborhood restaurants and I'll totally come back again. Service was awesome despite the loudness and the lines. It was well organized, friendly, helpful and fast. They hooked it up with lots and lots of toppings too. I loved the beer selection too. So many to choose from! Pizza Press vs Pieology ... I'll stick to Pizza Press. Just because of this promotion I'm able to know what's worth trying and what's good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This places is great & a great value.  Build your own pizza with anything you want for under $10.  The beer selection is great too!  Just try it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been on a two day binge of this place. Great food great employees and unique choices of beer.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pizza is great, the ingredients are very fresh and plenty to choose from.  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  This is definitely our new pizza place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Same concept as Blaze Pizza or Pieology. The only difference is the really rude staff. I don't like how the workers rush you, especially when there's no one in line. They all seemed impatient and mad, as if they really don't want to be there. I work in a very similar environment. That's bad customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is great! Of course depends on your ingredients of choice. What got me was their excellent customer service! Good food and good customer service is definitely worth 5 stars<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent. Great food. Good people. Fun place to be. Love going here after class at CSUF.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service is definitely better than pieology. The guy really took care of us, even taking the time to ask if we wanted the artichoke hearts w the leaves.

I don't remember how long it takes at pieology but our pizza only took 3 to 4 min in the oven after we paid. 

Crust is light and thin. Lots of sauce options: the pesto, ranch and the chimichurri were good on the side (they have little sauce cups.

Atmosphere more relaxed and none of the echo of everyone's conversations or loud scraping metal sounds from the chairs you get at pieology.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the third Pizza Press I've been to and I've gotta say, this is probably my favorite. Their marinara sauce is to die for. 
Way better then Pieology or Blaze pizza. You walk in the door and it feels like home. The employees are friendly and fun. 
It's a great place for vegetarians or picky eaters because you can easily customize your pizza AND you're watching them do it. They are more than accommodating.
I would recommend this place to everyone.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm quite sad I missed the grand opening- I hear they gave away free pizzas!

Anyway. I finally paid a visit after long awaiting the opening of this pizzeria. I'd read good things about the Anaheim location and was curious to try out the beers and compare the pizza to Pieology. 

I ordered the Herald and added spinach, topped with chimichurri. All of their bottled beer was $5 so I grabbed an 8% pumpkin ale. (Great deal!) I really loved the crust, I thought it was better than Pieology and allowed the flavors of the individual ingredients to shine through. I liked that they press the dough right in front of you- the fresh oil they use to keep it from sticking to the press makes the crust crunchy in the oven. It's a great texture. The actual toppings didn't seem all that different from other similar places, but that's not a bad thing. I like their option of white, red, or pink sauce and the post-oven sauces. 

My only complaint is that the employees didn't seem to have the recipes down and took a while to find someone over 21 to pour the bf's beer. It is a new store though, so I can't hold that against them. They gave me a 15% discount for being a CSUF  student so dinner ended up being cheaper than Pieology. Also, they're open until midnight, which is a good 2 hours after most other closeby restaurants close. Solid 5 stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">EXCELLENT!! We truly enjoyed our pizza AND beer...definitely planning a return trip. Good food, good customer service, good drink.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm normally not a big pizza eater but this place was one of the better pizza places I've tried. The sauce is good and doesn't taste as salty as other places. Also, I liked that the pizzas weren't overly greasy. The ingredients were fresh as well. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would recommend this pizza joint to others. I'll definitely stop by again if I'm in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Pizza Press has become more than just a place for great pizza! We have eaten at all 3 stores (as of 9/12/15), and the experience is like coming home to be with family. Great food & beverages! Service is top notch, and the staff is always courteous. One of the best attributes of Pizza Press is that you always see someone you know! Each store has its own unique personality. I definitely recommend it, and I frequently suggest Pizza Press to friends, family, and anyone else who is looking for an awesome place to eat!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They just opened this pizza place across of my school and my roommate and I decided to give this place a shot because we heard good things about this place. This is place is like any other customizable pizza place like pieology, blaze, etc. I was curious to try this place to see what makes this place different from any other place. Honestly, I felt like its all the same. No distinctive differences. All the concepts are the same and most of the ingredients are about the same with minor differences in choices. Since this is my first time going to this place, I was greeted and went into line to put my pizza order. I looked at the worker and he asked me what I wanted, and I was confused. I asked about what the sauces are. He wasn't very specific of what the sauces are. Then as we move forward to the order, he didn't help me or guide me on what each ingredients are. I was completely lost since there were no sign of the list of ingredients. I had to ask the worker every single section of what they have. After it is done, I did not know that there were end sauces or greens at the end. They did not tell me they had that option. The only reason I knew is when I saw it from the menu that was laying on the table. I wish they gave me that menu list before I ordered so I was aware of what to order.

Now the food. I really wish that the main sauce was more bold and distinctive. I can not taste the sauce like at all. I ordered the "pink sauce" which is a mix of Alfredo and marina. Honestly, all i tasted was the cheese. I had a lot of veggies toppings but I didn't think it really made the pizza. I also had fresh basil and basil pesto on top hoping it would make it better, it didn't. It was really light and didn't have that bold basil garlic flavor. 

I didn't see this place any different from other competitors. It's about the same so if you're expecting it any different from others, you are wrong.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Arrived at around 1pm built my pizza and worked my way to the register... 

The service wasn't great- I got skipped in line, because someone else behind me was apparently a VIP and deserved to be attended by the "publisher" first.... Or maybe a just a couple of friends. 

Got to the register at around 1:20 due to the delay and talk about the season finale of The Bachelor between the "publisher" and the VIP

So my pizza came out of the oven and the publisher asks me if I'd like anything else on it.. I get pesto and ranch and voila! 

It's time to pay:

-Cashier asks me if I want a beer
-I say "yeah give me your pomegranate cider"
-I get charged and leave a 20% tip on top of that
-total comes out to about $18


*BAM*
"We're actually out of pomegranate right now, would you like to wait? I'll get some out right now or I can get you something else"

I said I'd wait since he offered to bring some out shortly

I sit down at my table with my buddy and my water cup and start to chow down on my Pizza

THE PIZZA:

It was pretty thin, had some black crust on the outside (idk what changed, but this didn't happen before), but overall was pretty good- can't ask a lot from what is supposed to be a 5 minute pizza.

My buddy and I both finished just after 2PM and still don't have Pomegranate Cider!!

I go up to the guy to cancel it since I'm about to leave, and he goes to the back room to get the new keg out.. 

I tell him I just want to cancel it, and he does so and says sorry... And that was the end of that.

Overall: not a good experience<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is every students dream. The pizza press is exactly what we needed. Darn good and affordable pizza which is more than enough for any person and the craft beer selection  is off the chain! I got a pour of Velvet Merwin from Firestone, that's a special release. I'm writing this review while buzzing it with a very happy stomach. The only problem that needs to be fixed is the method of payment and tipping. Having the cashier ask you if you would like to tip and the amount is sort of uncomfortable. I always leave tip but this was kind of weird for me. But other than that, I love it. And 15% off for CSUF students...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time trying this place out. Great customer service ! Tristan helped us out and he was on top of everything. Even tried some beers before we got our pizza. Beer on tap is always good. Pretty cool. Will be coming back ! (:<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">HORRIBLE....HORRIBLE.....HORRIBLE.......HORRIBLE!!!! Pricey pizza that is lacking flavor. No order to the construct of the pie what so ever. Rude employees who would rather 420 than work I thinks. All in all mot impressed. Dont believe the hype as lemmings troll the night. Follow if you dare.......bwahahahahaha!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Limited pizza selection but varied enough to please different tastes (even have a gluten-free kind). Large beer selection, and cutest wine bottles ever. Good atmosphere (super friendly staff)  and great prices. 
Thank you!! Would go back in a heartbeat!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is great!! 

I have to say between the super friendly/fast customer service and the quality food, you can't beat it! 

Highly recommend it especially if you're looking for something quick and GOOD in between classes<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">love Love LOVE this place! My boyfriend and I both attend CSUF and we eat here regularly. I have personally tried every one of their created pizzas and there was not one I did not like. Daniel likes to do the "Publish your own" option and he digs it. They have great beers on tap. I especially like that they carry beer from San Diego breweries too. The pomegranate cider is also a fave of mine and they pretty much always have that one. I am a Print Journalism major and love the theme that they have here. It makes for a great ambiance and a good history. I have never been to Piology, but I am told the set up is the same. However, I am also told that Pizza Press is way better!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've only been here a few times but each time I have been pleasantly impressed.  It has a nice atmosphere and is a great place to come and relax after class.  The food is really good and really fresh!  I have only tried the make your pizza (what they are famous for), with pepperoni and sausage, but so far it has not disappointed.  The crust can sometimes be slightly burnt but some may prefer that.  The one thing that you can count on from this place is great service!  Often times they will walk around and help you clean up and they have even helped me out with wifi issues.  Oh yes, they do have free wifi too! Which makes going there even better! Friendly staff every time!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is great! If you're looking for a nice sized personal pizza this is the place to come to. Super fresh ingredients and great tasting every single time! Staff is very welcoming when it's your first time cause the process is a little daunting but the second time you go you'll be a pro. Pick your sauce, pick your cheese, pick your toppings and boom like 3 minutes later your very own pizza fresh of the press for you to garnish and devour. And their selection of craft beers is quite impressive because there is a lot to choose from and they change pretty regularly. Whether you're catching a bite between classes or taking someone on a first date, this place is classy enough and reasonably priced for both. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up, this is the best pizza joint in town no doubt.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The place is very clean! The staff are very warm and friendly! This is our second time here and we just love everything here! The Sun and The Times are our favorite here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Open until midnight. I'm thankful for the pizza here and will never go back to Pieology or Blaze.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We used to frequent Pieology pretty often, but we definitely like Pizza Press more now that we've tried it. They have better toppings like feta cheese & arugula. Love that they have beers on tap & outdoor seating so we can bring the pups.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Pizza here is AMAZING and very flavorable!!! I'm not a big thin crust fan, but this place makes me LOVE thin crust. The price is reasonable and the staff are awesome and very caring. They have a great selection of toppings and CHEESE! if you're a cheese lover, don't hesitate to get ALL the cheese on your pizza (: They have good selections of beers and change their selections everyday. If you had pieology and thought that place was great, imagine what your mouth will say when you try Pizza Press! I PROMISE YOU, it will not disappoint! ;)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Incredible! Wow this place was really good! I ordered my own style with white sauce, mozzarella, goat cheese, chicken and basil pesto. I mean wow it was delicious. Really tasty dough and fresh ingredients. They were also very generous with the amount of ingredients which I appreciated. I also appreciated the wonderful craft beer selection. I ordered a Firestone 805 and it was smooth and delicious. I've said delicious a few times, but hey it's true! Very charming interior and really great music. Highly recommend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thank you Pizza Press for making a good pizza every single time! So good!! The crust and ingredients are always kept exceptionally fresh. I love the fact that I can get a completely different pizza every time I go. Staff is super friendly and they always greet you with a warm greeting once you walk through the door. The theme is incredibly creative and the atmosphere is great. I am definitely a happy customer!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Walked in and was amazed with the interior design themed location. The menu is simple yet full of options. I tried "the sun" with spicy red sauce. I added green bell peppers to and drizzled pesto sauce. It tastes really good, on a scale of 1-10 flavor is 10, spicy is 7. I would recommend the sun or of your adventurous create your own.!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It was a little more expensive than Pieology, but I loved the concept (newspaper/printing press), and I liked that we could watch the pizza as it went through the stages of being made/baked. I could see how the process could be inefficient if it was busy, but luckily there weren't very many people there, so it didn't take too long.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a fairly new place and it's really good for the most part. I admire the restaurants design and how it features a newspaper press style pizza oven. When I get pizza, I look forward to the crust and so I believe that's what makes up a pizza. Every time I've visited Pizza Press, the bottom of the crust has been really burnt and the edges were way more toasted than I would have liked. I think that's the only thing that can be improved on a bit, but other than that it's a great place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the customer service and food is really good...check in and get a free drink why not? One of the best places to eat that is a walking distance from CSUF.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is epic when it comes to pizza and beer. Build your own pizzas, rotating drafts, friendly staff, and a great study environment with wifi and outlets under each table. This place is awesome especially when paired with beer!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here after a long day of school, the staff was extremely friendly and greeted me as I entered. The pizza and beer both get a 10/10 on my mouthwatering scale.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious pizza...I usually got custom..
Their pesto sauce is really good along with baked garlic<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is definitely for hipsters. The get up of the employees and the atmosphere of the restaurant just give that off (at least in my opinion)... It didn't hit home for me like Pieology does, but it was ok. The pizza I got was an awkward oval shape, which I found to be interesting. They have a decent selection of toppings and sauces. The pizza isn't bad, but nothing special either. Seemed a little overcooked for my taste, and didn't offer that flavor blast I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't bland either. Just an average pizza.. The clean location and friendly workers are what this place will thrive on.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can't call in cause trying to get up to the front of the line to get your pizza takes FOREVER.. It's so crowded by the time you get your pizza it taste gross.  Not worth the wait and money.... ZERO stars<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I go here between classes some days. I've been to the one in Orange and this one is fairly new. 

I like the ability to choose whatever I want and however I want. I don't care what others say, but ranch dressing and bbq sauce should always be on pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been a fan of build your own pizzas ever since Pieology first came around. I was a huge fan and wouldn't even consider trying any other place, but I'm so glad I tried this one! The pizza is EXCELLENT and the service is amazing! I was immediately welcomed by one of the workers (Lane) and he was very friendly and so kind! We talked while my pizza was being made and he was so optimistic and positive and I loved it! The pizza and customer service is phenomenal! I will definitely be back soon :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wayyyyyyy better than Pieology around the corner. Bread is much better tasting, crispier and actually holds up all the ingredients. My only comment is that they don't spread the ingredients very evenly at times making some parts of the pizza just sauce and bread. But other than that thumbs up :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great price, phenomenal pizza! I love love love the Gazette made vegan style. So many good flavors in that one and I really enjoy the amount of cheese on it. Crust is always flakey and covered to the rim in toppings. Try it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pretty good. Pink sauce is really good. I ordered the Sun and would order it again..add balsamic drizzle and cilantro at the end..Service was OK...I stood there 10minutes before being addressed or getting pizza started. Not sure i like the way you stand and wait til your pizza done,  especially since people in front of me were confused and held up the entire line. All in all i recommend it and would go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my favorite make your own pizza place. It's pretty similar to other ones, but it has more toppings to choose from and I love that I can add arugula or basil on top of my pizza at the end. The pizza is pretty good, and the decor inside is super trendy. I'd recommend trying this place out if you want pizza and you're in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was really good. Beside that, the consumer service was fantastic! My experience here was very pleasing, so I recommend people to try this place out. You won't regret it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've always been a Blaze Pizza kind of girl, so I definitely felt like I was betraying my first love. Against my heart, I love the Pizza Press pizza. The specials are classics, I've only tried the bbq pizza and it's absolutely delicious. The customer service could use some work, they're not as nice as Blaze Pizza workers. Overall, great location (near the college campus) and tons of outlets for students to use! I love coming here to satisfy my pizza cravings<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Pizza Press made me realize the garbage that is Pieology. Remember that time your mom told you to take out the trash? Well you essentially were taking out Pieology. 
Building my own pizza here with their fresh ingredients is your best option. They top the pizza with adequate amounts of veggies and meats. Always full and always satisfied.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Where was this place when I went to CSUF? Delicious pizza, great service, fun concept. Love it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent Pizza, made to perfection. I recommend the BBQ pizza. Very friendly staff, and the prices are great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They have vegan cheese !!!! I came here expecting to have to order a pizza with no cheese which is fine, but they have a vegan cheese option which is amazing!!!!! Tons of veggie toppings to load up on and the employees are so nice and very considerate of any diets or allergies you may have. They have beer on tap which is an added plus for us stressed out students. Perfect place for a study break :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This restaurant is the best! It's walking distance from school therefore getting there isn't a problem at all. Best topping! Good customer service! I totally recommend it<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good alternative to pieology or blaze pizza. Love their pink sauce. Pesto sauce is ok. Blaze has the best! They don't serve sausage chunks or ground beef. However their chicken is chunky and meaty. Pizza crust is really soft and thin. It gets a bit more chewy when it cools down. They have lots of beverage choices including beer. Some desserts too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is amazing! You can even custom make your own with vegan / vegetarian options including the cheese ! Pizza is tasty, great selection of craft beers on draft, and staff is extremely friendly! They always play great music here and prices are very affordable with great portion sizes. I come here every Wednesday for my weekly pizza and beer in between classes at Fullerton ;). They also have a great customer loyalty program. 5 stars !!!!! Also- jimmy helped me out and he is so awesome! He recommended beers and was extremely nice. Exceptional service from all staff! BEST PLACE EVER!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is awesome, hands down better ingridents than other CHIPIZZA stores. the roasted squash is my favorite topping and the finishing sauces are some of the best! You can truly tell the veggies are fresh and not freezer fried abominations. the crust they can make these pizza's come out with are hard to beat at ANY gourmet pizza joint. the Pasta salad is top notch and the prices are pretty reasonable... loaded pizza out the door for 9 bucks after tax or 12.36 with a pasta salad? I say this is a great buy!! staff is awesome!! beer selection is top notch!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hmm... I was at CSUF so I stopped by for lunch. This place is located very close to campus and it is new, clean, and modern inside. 
Pizza is just okay. The concept is very similar to pieology, pizzarev, and blaze. The pizza is $8 for premade and make your own.
I tried the spicy red sauce was (as some other reviews said) very mediocre, if anything. The spice level was non existent and just tastes like a lot of salt. I usually maximize my toppings at 3 on a pizza so I asked for LOTS of mushrooms. I felt like they skimped a bit on the toppings. That being said, they have a lot more toppings and sauce options that other places don't have (corn, rose sauce, chimmichurri drizzle, balsamic glaze, etc). All ingredients were very fresh.
I also liked the oven which worked like a moving belt. This ensures even cooking time for every pizza, which other build your own pizza places struggle with. 
I would come back again, but I would definitely try the regular tomato sauce.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went here to try based on a friends recommendations, I def like this place over blaze pizza and pieology. The flavor and its quality were def better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Pizza was ok, if you want to go make your own self pizza, Project Pizza is way better. The staff here are rude and belligerent, and i'm pretty sure they drink on the job, the employee making our pizza was fumbling around, and throwing the cooking utensils and bottles of sauce into the veggies he puts on people pizza, and making nasty comments about other customers. Also the music choice doesn't make sense, it a pizza place but they're playing rap! Definitely not a family place, don't bring your kids here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is legit. I love the theme of being part of a print press company, except its pizza! I feel like I accomplished something as I created my pizza. Only wished my pizza was a little more circular, because it was an oval shape. Pretty awkward to eat, but was delicious! Published my own pizza and had all the toppings I wanted. I never really crave Pieology, but for some reason I had a craving for this place. Reason? Guess I don't like studying<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pizza here is delicious!! Didn't know what to to order because there a lot of options, so I just made my own and it turned out to be amazing. The staff is friendly also! Plan on coming here again!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The prices are great, the pizza is OK, but not great. Like many in this sector, you pick what you want on your pizza as they make it. Many of the ingredients are of basic grocery store quality.  The salads are prepackaged, not fresh made.  There are better choices for Napoli style pizza in Fullerton, some far more pricey but, well better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The idea of Pizza Press is creative. The "build your own" pizza is a go to option. The pizza quality is alright. It's a standard custom pizza. They have many toppings, but the pizza quality could be better. I enjoyed paying a little more to get Pizza Hut or Dominos, or pay less and get good pizza at Costco. Pizza Press is convenient for students and brings a old theme into the pizza game. The interior is what makes Pizza Press what it is. From the font of the menu to the presentation of the pizza -- it's a plus. It's worth trying it if you stumble across one!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here a few times and the service is always great, gotta love a place with friendly employees and quick service. Tristan helped me out tonight and he was exceptional, thanks bud! The chimichurri sauce has me hooked and I actually love my pizza with the daiya cheese, nom nom nom!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came during busy lunch time, looked like they might have been shorts staffed but we're very quick, accurate, and apologetic. They even made me an extra pizza because my first bubbled up in the oven. So many fresh toppings and my pizza always comes out perfect. Love it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great pizza! Great beer!!!!! The guys are awesome!! 5 star attitude!!! Definitely my new fav place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The crust is very thin and the sauce is usually very spread out.  I've been here a few times, tried their premade pizza types as well as my own choosings, but with how expensive it is and how low quality their pizzas turn out, I probably won't be trying this place anymore.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This restaurant opened just down the street from my house so I had to try it. I was hoping it would be different than pieology. I was so happy that it was! It tastes amazing. Good job Pizza Press.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Seems like they're chintzing on the toppings this time. Make sure to show them your CSUF id to get a buck off. (Or so). My favorite is the Tribune with pesto added on at the end.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This create your own pizza establishment is trying and I give them credit especially since it's near CSUF. I went here one day hours before my next class for lunch and I created my own pizza. The crust was thin and crunchy. I liked that they had enough seating inside and the staff was nice. I would come here again for pizza!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely a favorite! Staff is always friendly and the place is clean and well decorated. Did I mention that the pizza is THE BEST around? No? Well, it is!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would just like to say that I love pizza and waiting forty five minutes for an overpriced pizza at pizza hut is no longer necessary now that this place has opened up so close to me. My favorite part would have to be the atmosphere, you walk in and are greeted instantly with enthusiasm, not the dull monotone like other places. The design of the place is pretty self explanatory. You start at the entrance and work your way down customizing your own pizza or getting a signature pizza. I've tried them all so far, but the Herald has my heart. On top of delicuos pizza that's cooked to perfection , they have a conveyor belt style oven instead of the oven at pieology where sometimes it's undercooked or overcooked, the human element is absent in the cooking of your pizza, the result is deliciousness. You can then choose from a pretty large selection of soft drinks or even better one of their 20 beers that are so diverse that even if you went everyday you wouldn't be able to try them all. I gave this place five stars because it's fast, clean, cheap , open later than Every thing else around it and you can actually have a conversation with the staff, unlike the robotic service you experience at Chiptole where you are herded through like the cattle they serve. Great job pizza press! I'll be trying your other locations soon!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I originally ate at the Orange Location, which I'm assuming is their very first considering the huge lines that always congregate there. When I found out they were opening a new location 7 minutes away from me, I was more than happy about not having to take a 1 hour trek to Orange for my pizza fix. 

Overall, the location itself is pretty identical to the one in Orange. When it comes to the pizza, I would have to give the edge to Orange. I'm not sure if it was because I only went once, but they skimped on certain key ingredients (sauce, cheese) and were overall very sluggish. If you are a regular at Pieology/Blaze, I would highly recommend you go to the Orange location if possible. 

In short, what Pizza Press has an edge over Pieology/Blaze is better quality, which is why it takes a bit longer at Pizza Press to get your pizza. If you frequent Fullerton a lot, and you're always on the go, its definitely worth a try.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is Pieology with beers on tap, and a wide selection to boot. As far as I'm concerned -- if you're over 21 -- there is absolutely no reason to go to Pieology when this place is a short walk from CSUF with ample parking.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great, friendly service!  Delicious pizza, good beer on tap.  I loved all the fresh ingredient options.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Solid pizza spot, great variety of beers on tap, good prices and deals, and Open until Midnight<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here on Saturday with the rest of the hungry masses hawking their free vouchers. A paid photographer kept stepping on our toes while waiting in line, but the line moved quickly. Staff was well prepared for the volume. The line wasn't too dreadful because of all the beers you can read about drinking on beer advocate while waiting. The knuckle sandwich was on draft! The thing that separates the press from pieology is the mozzarella. Press uses small pellets that are dry leaving the crust super crispy instead of soggy in the middle like pieology. I ordered the Tribune which had nice touches like kalamata olives and roasted bell peppers. It was excellent. This place has put the full court press on pieology.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">BEST pizzas in town! Try the herald, it's one of the tastiest white pizzas. You can create your own salads too. The staff is friendly and their suggestions for pizza creations are wonderful.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My all time favorite pizza place. So amazing ... I had it for 4 days straight... That's how obsessed I am with this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I loved this place! The pizza tastes better than Pieology and the customer service is phenomenal! I'm not sure if I spoke to the owner at the cash register but he was so accommodating. They gave me a discount because I was a student which is a plus and my pizza didn't come out correctly so they let me keep it and made me a new one! The cookies are SO delicious it was gooey and melted in my mouth I loved it and I'm craving one now. They also check on you while you're eating so they really are passionate with their custkmer service. The interior is so cool! Everything was really clean I loved it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best personal pizza I've ever had for under $10, beats out pieology and CPKs thin crust BBQ chicken pizza by a mile.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I finally tried this place after a friend raved about it.  I was a non believer, but after I tried it, it is bomb.com.  I didn't think the pizza would fill me up, but it is surprisingly filling as I couldn't even finish it.  I got a basic pepperoni and sausage pizza with the pink sauce (I highly recommend it) and it was delicious.  The crust is thin and crispy just how I like it.  You can tell they use only high quality ingredients, and the press they use to press the dough makes the crust that much better.  To top it off, they have like 20 craft beers on tap, most of the other personal pizza places don't have this.  Pizza and beer, doesn't get much better than that.  They also had that deep house playing in there, which I'm a big fan of.  Shout out to the pizza press DJ lol.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Literally the most photogenic pizza I've ever seen! Super fast, friendly energetic staff and they're actually open past 9pm which is a miracle in this old lady town!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Outstanding Pizza!!  Place is nicely appointed too.  If you like Pieology (that place is tooooo noisy) you'll like this even better....crust is excellent and the selection of toppings is perfect.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever had!! Delish and reasonably priced...all pizzas are $8.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious pizza, thin crispy crust and the sauce and toppings can be completely customized.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Classical modern clean decor, old news press theme.  Pizza seems to be of an individual portion, but it is a generous portion (I couldn't finish the entire pizza).  Discount is given to CSUF students.  Reasonably priced at $8 for the Tribune (pepperoni, sausage, roasted bell pepper, kalamata olives, mushrooms, red onions, cheese, ricotta cheese and Parmesan cheese).  Will definitely be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you like Pieology, you'll like Pizza Press. The pizza making concept is the same but adding the basil pesto sauce at the end gave the pizza a good flavor kick. You can't go wrong with Stumptown cold brew either. I'm also big on service and this location has great service. The owner was very nice and went out of the way to make sure we had a great dining experience.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good but not as good as the Orange location. Service was great though. New location so they just need to work on perfecting consistency on what they serve. Also note to workers dont go so cheap on the toppings!! Like pulling teeth to get cheese put on the darn thing!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Eating the pizza as I type. Its delicious. The staff coached me into the perfect slice, and paired me up with Bootlegger's Knuckle Sandwich to wash it down. Doors kept swinging and I'm impressed with how, even with limited seating, the place never felt too crowded. Quality was top notch, and I look forward to grabbing my next slice. I work and study nearby and I've been looking for a place to frequent. I think i found it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quality ingredients, cheap prices, and great tasting pizza! Great ambience and customer service. I highly recommend this place; the ambience and cleanliness of this place are very evident right away. Also, they have the most amazing bottled soda that I have ever tried. The orange cream soda and root beer are very tasty! Try this place, you'll be happy that you did!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A decent pizza, but it would behoove them to focus mote on making a delicious pizza and less on trying to be "artisan".<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">this place has the same concept as pieology BUT i feel like their ingredients feel fresher.  the fresh herbs that you can get sprinkled on the top made the pizza tastes so much better and i love the fact that the center of my pizza isn't soggy like it gets at pieology.  they also serve local beers, a huge plus!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The  quality of food is excellent love the beer selection. But this is not a place to go when you are on your lunch break.... Unless you order in advance. It took longer than I would have like it had to take it to go<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is pretty much just like Pieology and but just fancier. I didn't get a chance to compare both prices but I'm sure they're very close. But pizza press has a thicker crust so you get fuller faster otherwise they're the same place. But this one is across the street from Csuf so I just go here. Really nice people too<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome pizza and beer! I love that there is something for everyone. The cheesy bread is to die for! I highly recommend it. The employees are very friendly and helpful, especially Erin.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place so much! Better than piology and the sweetest people. Erin is always so nice and always makes sure I am happy with my order. She is the cutest young lady and I love seeing her face when I am here. And Tina! So Sweet<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Visited around 730pm on a Wednesday.  Line was out the door.  There were five people behind the counter when they could have used ten.  It took forty minutes start to finish for take out.  Ordered and paid for cookie sandwich only to find out they were out of cookies.  Pizza was decent but not nearly as good as others in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">While Pizza Press has excellent pizza they have gone way down hill since opening in their customer service department and offerings to customers.  For instance when they first opened their vegan cheese was no charge,  then they started charging  $1 extra for it. At Blaze Pizza this is free. They have no consistency!  Today I went in to order my usual pizza with BBQ sauce as a base. I was told this no longer an option for customers because it wasn't cost effective for Pizza Press. Really!  BBQ Sauce? I walked out. All the other design your own pizza places offer BBQ sauce with no issue. I guess I will just stick to my favorite place now Blaze Pizza. To bad there are none by CSUF!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The customer service is great. Build your own pizza. 20 beers on tap. What more can you ask for?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service was great, the pizza was bomb! I ate the whole thing and didn't feel all fat and nasty like with most pizzas.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best pizza I've ever had in my life. A lot of people may complain that the line is too long but there is definitely a reason why it can be long, it's amazing pizza. The employees are well dressed and very friendly and the environment is amazing. I don't mind waiting a few minutes for my pizza either, the wait is definitely worth it. This place is ten times better than pieology, you will not be displeased eating at the pizza press.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decided to try out Pizza Press instead of Pieology because I heard that they had the white sauce!  The pizza was delicious and the service was great! The ambience of the place was very modernized and the cheesiness of the pizza was on point!! Loved it. Will definitely be back again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. We were first time guests at Pizza Press and we're excited to use our gift card. When we got to the register they figured out that the gift card system had not yet been set up. Instead of being customer service centered and giving us the pizzas because of their mistake, they said that we needed to pay with a credit card. Long story short we left and went to a different pizza press. Will not be going back to that one again<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time here, we live really close and thought we would give it a try. I mean it's pizza how bad can it be? Very nice location, completely empty when we arrived. Greeted by a small Asian girl in a hat, who seemed to still be "learning" about the company and the process of decorating your pizza. We were very excited for pizza but once she started with the sauce, we knew this was going to be a tough experience. She put barely any sauce to begin with. We asked for more and got again barely anything. I had already given up. Even with the cheese and meats she gave us a very little amount. At pieology or other make your own pizza places they cover your pizza with cheese, sauce and any toppings that you may desire. My pizza looked very bare. Staff was not very friendly still seem like they are training and have no idea what to do. The cashier pushed us to try their "good" beer. After we said no she kept talking about them. Overall experience was blah, I surely wont go back and will stay with PIEOLOGY.<p>
</p></p>
