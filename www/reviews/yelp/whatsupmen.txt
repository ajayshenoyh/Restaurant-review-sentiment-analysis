<p itemprop="description">This is one of my favorite places to have Japanese food. When you walk up you need to put down your name on the wait list. Mind you this place gets really busy since it's right next to CSUF. But certainly worth it!!

I always order a lot when I go here. I get the gyoza (pot stickers) and chicken karage (Japanese style fried chicken) to start off with. The flavors are quite authentic since most of the staff here are Japanese workers. And for the main entree I always get a nice bowl of ramen with miso or pork broth. 

Service is very friendly and the place is very clean. But at the end of the day it's the food that counts here. The only thing that sucks is that it's not closer to where I live.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love ramen. And yes, I love pho. But the difference is that I feel a lot better about myself after a bowl of ramen over a bowl of pho. What's Up Men, specializes in ramen which should tell you how good and focused they are to their product. Unlike some places that might make ramen and sushi or katsu, etc. I've been here a few times and I have to admit it's not always consistent. Sometimes everything tastes perfect and sometimes, I have to wonder if they switched chefs. And it shows, since occasionally you might see a huge line outside and other times you can walk right in. 

The broth is what counts. They do a good job on the cook and the flavoring of all their broths. Never too salty or bland. If you order with extra noodles, you'd never know because they say they put it in already, but looks about the same as someone who didn't get the extra noodles. I think they should consider separating that onto another bowl that can be dumped in the broth later. 

I really do like this place, but its not one of my favorite ramen places. There's good ramen in Fountain Valley and in Rowland Heights, but they have even closer competition just down the street in downtown Fullerton. I hope they continue to do well and only improve.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The go to place for our lunch ramen cravings.  Make sure you arrive early as the line can fill up pretty quickly.  

My usual is the chuka soba lunch combo.  It's nice that you can select from a variety of choices to go with your ramen, i.e. Gyoza, curry rice, salad..etc. 
the noodle and broth are very flavorful.  The noodle is very well cooked, nice chewy texture.  I particularly like the chuka soba because it brings a sense of comfort and satisfaction after I eat it.  Definitely can't get enough of it.  

Other ramen broth like the Cha, kuro, are just as flavorful and tasty.  Definitely impressed with the quality of the food here.  Highly recommend.  My Japanese friend thinks this is as authentic as it gets in comparison to real Japanese ramen, and that speaks volumes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tonight I ordered the karage and it was over fried cause it wasn't as juicy as I'd like it. My beef curry went skimpy in the meat department as their was only one beef chunk. My two other friends got ramen and they too felt a little ripped. For the price you pay you get very little and the taste is nothing compared to Little Tokyo, Los Angeles. 

I'll pass by next time and go elsewhere.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What's up Men is my go-to spot for late night ramen.  My boyfriend is a nurse and works odd hours.  He is usually off by 10:30pm which is pretty late and I'm sleepy by then.  But he always bribe me with ramen.  So off we go, sleepy or not.  The service is pretty quick if there's not a lot of people waiting.  Very small place but it's cute.  Ramen and reggae music.  I love the combo.  Waiter and waitresses are nice and accommodating.  

My usual drink selection is the iced great tea.

Ramen selection would be the "Aka Kara Miso Ramen" with extra egg, bamboo and Chasu Pork.  (Broth is very delicious and not so heavy).  My boyfriend usually orders the "Kurt Ramen" with extra Chasu Pork.  

Appetizers we would order are the "Homemade Kimchi" (goes well with the ramen), "Takoyaki" (Texture is different but overall good), "Karaage" (who doesn't love deep fried goodness?) and "Agedashi Tofu" (Crispy yet soft in the middle and the fish broth compliments the tofu very well).

Sometimes when I just feel like having something light with rice, I usually order the Chashu Don rice bowl.  So delicious!!!

And there you have it, I always waddle out of there at the end of my meal satisfied.  Thank you What's up Men and crew!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ramen seems to be our go to food when trying to sober up and this place did not disappoint after a full day of beer chugging at the OC Fair.

Pretty tiny but that seems to be the consensus among all of the non-chain ramen places I've tried.  For a party of 6, we waited for about 30 minutes on a Sunday night.  Mind you it's summer time.  

AKA - Kara Miso (Spicy Miso Flavored)
** me likey.  Granted my taste buds were just as inebriated as I was, but I liked it. The savory broth was not overpowering in its spiciness and paired quite well with the fried rice.  Don't judge.  I like carbs on top of carbs, kay?

Cha-Han
**  Fried rice, yo.  And a pretty good one at that.

Now they offer this ramen dish that's served cold.  Perfect for summer.  It's very light and flavorful.  But I can't remember what it's called.  It's really good, though, so if you feel like it's too hot for regular ramen, ask for the cold one.

I just might be back.  If I'm in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What's Up Men makes perfectly decent ramen. This is not the blow-your-mind-fantastic ramen that you'll find in Costa Mesa, but that's okay by me. Know that the sitting space is small inside and if you don't call ahead for pickup, you will wait about 30 min. They only give you 2 slices of pork. 1/2 a soft boiled egg. But when you're craving a bowl of ramen in Fullerton (at midnight!), no one beats them. This is late night craving satisfaction at its best. I usually order Cha (miso flavored) and ask for a side of chile flakes for a bit of kick. If you like a good amount of pork, you definitely have to order extra. 
I prefer this place over Kopan Ramen because the prices are better and you don't have to order every ingredient separately. Also the broth at Kopan is way too creamy for my taste. What's Up Men has my late night vote.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yes, I'm glad they stay open late especially when you need to sober up after bar hopping. I've got the miso soup meal with gyoza on the side. They give a lot of noodles and broth which feels you up quickly. I love the staff here, they turn the tables quickly and refilled my water like 3x cause I was hella thirsty. The prices about $10-12 but that seems fair considering how popular this place was. The only sad part is that parking can be a pain so park toward the back of the building to avoid ugly drivers haha. The food is really good, and they have other alternatives if you don't want to consider ramen.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Overall this place was not bad. I definitely like it better than Koppan ramen in DTF. (Idk why but my brother and I both felt like shit after eating at koppan ramen and we went at different times so.. yeah) 

Anyway, this place has pretty good noodles and their Takoyaki was pretty good.. the reason I'm giving 3 stars is because I didn't think the broth was amazing. I got the Ara (spicy miso) and I felt like it was lacking in flavor.

I think there are better ramen places (better taste and slightly cheaper) if you go towards LA.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Overall the food is always excellent and the service is beyond your expectation most of the time, no matter they are too busy or not. 
I was born and raised in Japan, always missing Japanese food, and have tried lots of restaurants running by Japanese owners, but I feel this restaurant is the best one ever.... not only the taste of food but anything---their quality of the service including the speed of taking order and the time until the food comes, and their friendliness. 
Inside of the restaurant including restroom is always neat and clean. 
I won't call this restaurant as a Ramen shop but an Authentic Japanese restaurant, for the taste of food other than Ramens are also good,  and the atmosphere is comfy--- Everything is so familiar to me and I feel like I'm back home.
スタッフの方々は神対応だし、お料理はいつもおいしいし、日本に帰ったみたいに落ち着くので家族でよく行きます。日本のレストランの中で一番好きです( *´`* )<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Small place and there is usually a wait. We waited probably 20 minutes to get seated. Be prepared to sit close to the people at the table next to you. We ordered the Kuro ramen which is soy sauce based. It was delicious. We ordered extra noodles but didn't realize how big the serving size was. Great place for a quick ramen bowl.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place may feel like a small cafe zone because of the size of the place. The ramen itself was a very standard and price wise it is generous. However, I did not like how they don't give in regards of pork and other fillings. But I liked how the broth itself wasn't that salty, making it more enjoyable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pretty good ramen if you are out in the OC area!  We both got the Kuro Ramen in a lunch combo.

1) Kuro Ramen combo with a side of Pork Fried Rice - I love how rich and buttery the ramen broth was!  The pork in the bowl was very generous and very savory.  The ramen texture was the perfect texture, not to soggy, not too hard.  The fried rice was a bit bland and lukewarm and wasn't anything special though.

2) Kuro Ramen combo with Cha-Siu Bowl - The ramen was excellent, just like with the other combo.  I loved the soft Cha-siu pork!  It was soft and fatty, just the way I like it.  I enjoyed trying this bowl as a side in this combo, and will get this again!

With 5 likes on a social media post, they give you an extra portion of noodles.  It is worth $1, but as you can see from the picture, it's a really big scoop of noodles!

I have found a new ramen place I have fallen in love with.  We will definitely come back again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First visit I was like ..."wow.. these taste exactly like what I had when I was in Japan!"
After that, when I crave for ramen, this place is always the first ramen restaurant that pop out in my mind.

I love their fried chicken and tofu... they are just wonderful to go with your ramen..
I don't really write reviews, but this place is just too good..!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Finally got a chance to stop by! Came by for dinner last night and was quickly greeted with "Irashaimase's." 

We started off with the Takoyaki ($5) and the boyfriend ordered the Soy Sauce Ramen ($11). I wasn't feeling the ramen, so I opted for the Chashu Bowl ($7.5) . I also ordered a side of their red ginger (an additional $0.50). I was originally irked at the fact that they would charge for a side of ginger, but after looking at the amount that they served, I immediately took it back.

The takoyaki came with 6 balls of fried and smothered octopuses. The outside had a nice crunch to it while the inside was creamy and full of flavor. 2 negatives though: 1) the octopus piece was the size of my fingernail and 2) they soaked it with wayyy too much eel sauce and toppings. Ramen had a deep, heavy flavor which was out of the ordinary since soy based ramens are generally lighter than others such as miso. The boyfriend seemed to like it so no concerns there. My chashu bowl was by far the best out of everything. It came in a huge bowl and was covered with thin slices of pork above the rice. It was pretty oily/bland at first but after sprinkling some soy sauce for more flavor, it was perfect. Probably a 9/10. 

Waitress was friendly and was quick to refill our waters. Despite the waiting list going on and crowds coming in, we never felt rushed and the staff didn't drop off our checks to hurry us out.

Their lunch specials look pretty awesome, so I guess I'll have to stop by again for that :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always here after my night classes since it's open till very late. Definitely one of the only few authentic ramen places in the area. During lunch time and dinner time, you might have to wait a little bit, but if you're alone or okay sitting on the bar seats, you might not have to wait as long.

I usually order shiro (salt flavor with pork broth) or chashu don (pork belly bowl). Shiro is salt flavored and not too thick or bland. You get few slices of pork bellies, which melts in your mouth and a soft-boiled egg.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I went to a Ramen house and didn't get Ramen, Bad choice#1. This place was A-Ok though, nothing outstanding. My BF wanted Donburi and this was the only location we could find that had it on the menu, plus it had good reviews so it was worth a try. To start this place is small, and busy! Which deceivingly made me think there was a mystery greatness about it. (Think it was just a small place though) 

We started off with two appetizers, the Takoyaki (Fried Octopus)and Karaage (Fried Chicken). The Takoyaki was surprisingly a little better than I thought it would be (the octopus took me a while to find since it was teeny tiny, but the taste and texture was pretty on par) it was probably the only dish we actually finished. The Karaage was meh, it was really chewy and hard to eat, and didn't have much flavor--probably would have chosen something different in my opinion--I ate one piece and was done.

I wasn't particularly hungry for Ramen so I chose a half bowl Donburi (Mabo Don--tofu and pork in spicy sauce) and the other dish was a half bowl of Gyu Don (Beef bowl). The better things about these dishes was I LOVE how they have half bowls at $5.00! Perfect for trying out and the rice had a really good texture. Haha. The flavor was okay...... nothing fantastic. The Beef bowl looked EXACTLY like how they make it at Yoshinoya honestly. Both weren't bad but they weren't great either. Maybe they could do something about the flavor so you don't have to add a bunch of seasoning to the dish from the counter.

After literally trying a variety package of meat, I left thinking.. okay at least we tried it. At least the price and service was good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love ramen and What's up Men seemed like a great choice to satisfy my ramen craving. Located on State College, next to Pieology, What's Up Men is a small restaurant with about 6-7 tables. Luckily, there was no wait when I came here for dinner on a Saturday night.
I ordered karaage (deep fried chicken) and AKA (spicy miso with chasu). The karaage was so gooooddd. Outside was crispy and inside was not too dry. The AKA broth was also good. It wasn't too salty like other places and the spicy miso was very flavorful. They also gave me a fair amount of chasu. One complaint I have though, is that there was too much bean sprout. I had to dig extra hard to find any noodles because it was covered by the mountain of bean sprouts.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The environment of this place is probably the closest to what you get in Japan. Waitresses are friendly and helpful, all employees greet you when you enter and leave the restaurant, and they are very quick at service! One thing I really liked seeing was that this restaurant works as a team. I saw a chef come out of his post to help the waitresses clean the tables, since it was so busy during lunch time. I got Chuka (classic ramen), and my BF got Miso. Personally, I loved the broth better in the classic ramen. We also got: fried chicken, gyoza, and fried rice. Everything was super yummy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is very clean and nice. The bar area is a little small but we decided to sit there anyways. The waitresses are attentive and really nice. 
We ordered karaage, a lunch combo with tonkatsu shoyu ramen and beef bowl, as well as a shoyu ramen. I thought everything tasted pretty good. The karaage comes with a bit of side salad and kewpie mayo. It was crispy and flavorful. The breading was alright but the inside was good. 
The ramen is somewhat reminiscent of Japan. There's a good layer of oil and the noodles are very Q. I think it came with the right amount of toppings and the portions are filling. 
I did enjoy the shoyu one better than the tonkatsu but both had strong points. 
I didn't understand their social media promotion though. How do you do likes on Yelp? Haha.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When it rains, the only thing that goes through my  mind is ramen~ (fat kid confessions). So I've been thinking of this place for 3 days straight now, and I'm finally here. And I couldn't be any happier!!!!!!!!! 

They've change this free noodle check-in to a 5 like minimum on a Facebook, Yelp, Twitter, or Instagram post which seems fair. A free noodle with check-in was just too easy. But in my opinion, you really don't need the extra noodle because they really do give you your money's worth.
 
I freaking love it here, they seriously never disappoint!!! This time I ordered the kuro ($8.50) and it was way better than the shiro. The noodles come medium/hard, so if you prefer your noodles soft just make sure to tell your server. My boyfriend ordered the beef bowl since he's not a big fan of ramen (). It tastes like the yoshinoya beef bowl, but way better quality.

Service is always quick and attentive. They try to seat people as quick as possible, we waited for about 10-15 minutes with 4 parties ahead of us. Yay~ 

Music is always on point too. This time they were playing reggae, like whaaaaat???? Reggae + ramen, ok okkkkk. They always surprise me with their music choices, but I love it!!!!!!!!!! 

Agh, ok I'm done. I'm just really happy I got my ramen fix. Hehe<p>

</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oh goshh. I just worked 16 hrs and cant sleep. Lucky for yelplandium im just write shit. Being this braindead im quite sure some funky stuff will be said, i mean written.

First off i thought this was some speed dating place. The name/franchises is one of themost fudged up names ever unless its like a meal for thunder down under.

Buuut they have cute japanese servers here :D except for our server. She was quite alien looking. 

Ventured here with rudy con mai. 

We got all sorts of crap except men. Well i forgot what soup i got, we posted tons of pics. I think it was spicy or aka or anna or something. It wasnt very spicy, more salty than anything. The ramyun was good, i can eat it all day. Just needed one noodle refill.

This place is soo much better than ajisen but less variety. And diversity. 

$10 for us skinny people
!15 for you fatties<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great ramen spot near CSUF and Fullerton College. The cold weather had me craving ramen for a few days and we finally got around to getting some. We beat the busier times by coming here around 4:30. Duos get seated much faster than groups. We had the spicy miso and the aka. :-)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Aka ramen with a side bowl during lunch special hours is only $12.50!!! It's so much food for such a good price as some ramen places in Los Angeles charge $12.50 alone for just a bowl of ramen!

Noodles were cooked very nicely. It was a tad chewy just how we personally like it. The broth was flavorful & the chashu was tender & cooked beautifully.

We both paid an extra $1 for a seasoned soft boiled egg. It was tasty & cooked nicely, however, we received it fully cold. Like, just pulled out of the refrigerator cold. So once you receive the egg, throw it into your bowl right away & let it sit to warm up.

We also ordered a side of:
- curry rice bowl: HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
- chashu bowl: delicious as well! The chashu was cooked so nicely. They also complimented the rice with sauce. So good!

Service was standard. They were actually a bit busy, so the server didn't get to help us too much, but we weren't put off by it. We enjoyed our food.

OVERALL, if you're in the area looking for a ramen fix, this place is solid & I could definitely come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Perfectly respectable Ramen can now be found on the footsteps of Cal State Fullerton's campus. 

I have been interested in trying What's Up Men's style of Ramen for some time now thanks to both word-of-mouth from local and intense Yelp interest. Although the reviews do not seem to point in any clear direction, I think it is safe to say What's Up Men puts on a credible Ramen experience. You can tell by the service and the cleanliness of the interior that this restaurant is a labor of love, small business effort. All of the employees were genuinely eager to please and offered suggestions at request. My drinks even remained full without having to flag anybody down - try doing that at Santouka! 

I decided upon the "Cha Ramen" which is their take in Miso Ramen along with 4 pieces of Gyoza and a Diet Coke which came to roughly $13.00. That is about par for the course these days in the OC Ramen scene. 

The Gyoza was the first to arrive and it was a complete winner. The dumplings were soft and juicy while having a thin and crispy bottom on each individual Gyoza; served with the bottom side up. The mixture of the filling was heavy on the vegetable side which gave a light and airy mouthfeel that really absorbed their house Gyoza Sauce. This is a good thing because What's Up Men's Gyoza Sauce is the most complex and flavorful I have ever had. 

A delightful start. 

The Miso Ramen was soon to follow and it held it's own. The broth is a deep and full bodied experience that never crossed over into the "too oily" spectrum. The addition of Black Garlic Oil really put the flavor profile over the top for me, a very close second to Yamadaya in that regard. The Chashu was so soft that it immediately disintegrated once it landed on my tongue; It was a potent package of umami and salt. The actual Ramen Noodles had a firm texture that allowed just enough chewing without tiring my jaw. Furthermore, I they did a great job of allowing the broth to coat their surface. None of the accoutrements failed to deliver and the Cha Ramen was largely a success on all fronts. 

The portions were large, borderline huge, and I walked outside into the rain completely full and ready to attack the afternoon. Well, after the food coma that is. What's Up Men is about as good as Ramen gets in Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This summer has been all about knocking out my bookmarks so after yet another comment from someone saying this place was great, and yet another response from me of "oh I have that on my bookmark list", we just had to go!

We came in on a Wednesday night, party of 4 around 6:30.  We had braced ourselves for a wait but the place wasn't full and we were ushered to a table inside right away.

We shared gyoza and I had the Chuka Soba which is classic ramen in a chicken broth base.  The gyoza was phenomenal, just the perfect blend of crispiness from the pan fry to one side and softness of the rest.  The veggie/meat mixture in the middle was also amazing making this the best gyoza I've had in a long time.  My Chuka Soba was also good although I had to doctor up my broth with a little soy sauce and what ever that red dust is that they have on the table (SO GOOD).  I particularly liked the flavored soft boil egg that was in it as well as the fish cake (I'm a sucker for that stuff).  I had a taste of the spicy miso broth and in comparison with mine, thought that broth was richer and more interesting, however once I doctored my broth up I was just fine.

Next time I'm going to get my own gyoza and put it in my ramen.  Will probably also add some more veggies because I felt like there could be more going on in there.  Will we be back?  Absolutely!

Yelp 100 challenge: 48/100<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Visiting Cal Univ. in Fullerton I've been invited for lunch at "What's Up Men". As I was a guest I just said yes sure.. expecting a local fast food on the style of 5 guys or something.. then surprise.. Japanese restaurant! How did they come out with such a name is unknown also to the two Japanese waitresses I asked for.. Outside and on the menu "What's Up" is written in English, but if you look for "Men" you can't find it anywhere as it is written in Japanese.. anyhow waiting time was 20 minutes with a quiet line of people, mainly Asian, standing outside (the restaurant is really small) but it was sunny and I enjoyed the company. 

I tried the combo with Ramen Miso and side dumplings Gyoza. The Ramen came with really "al dente" (yippee!) wheat egg noodles in broth of sliced pork (super yummy). From my little experience random Ramen come too salty or too spicy or too greasy or watery, but this Ramen was just perfect!  A riot of colors, flavors and fragrances, not salty, tasty and aromatic broth with a mix of seasonings, soy sauce, miso, ginger and other mysterious ingredients. 

Gyoza are side dumplings, they look good and crispy nicely aligned, but kind of oily. Next time I will order the Ramen solo! (that also comes with half flavored egg, missing in the combo)

4 Stars!!!!

</p></p><p itemprop="description">On vacation and craving some yummy ramen found me here. Being from Hawaii where all kinds of Asians come together, I thought I knew what true ramen was. I thought wrong. What's Up Men blows any ramen place I ate at in Hawaii away, it makes my favorite ramen spot look like the McDonalds of ramen places. We walked in before the dinner rush at 5:30, wrote my name on the little paper and waited no less then 5 mins to be greeted. We were seated and out drink order was quickly taken. After reviewing the menu I opted for the Miso ramen which was completely and utterly delicious! We also order the Kim Chi fried rice which was just as delicious. As the night went on they got more crowded, it's a very small spot that seats about 30-40 people with about 5 or 6 booths so get there early! 

If I'm ever in the area I'm definitely coming back here to get my ramen on.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is pretty good. Good tasting soup, the only thing that lacked was the quality of the pork belly, didn't taste that great. Decent place but I will stick with kopan ramen down the road. But will still pass through on a whim since its slightly closer to home than kopan.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What's Up Men

Ordered the AKA Kara spicy miso ramen with the curry rice bowl combo. 
The curry bowl was good but the Ramen broth wasn't spicy rather salty instead. Even though it was salty it still tasted a bit bland overall. I had to drink at least 3 cups of water to get halfway through the broth.
I asked for a side of soft boiled egg which actually came COLD and the yolk was already becoming semi dry. That wasn't good especially since I had to pay extra for it. 
I did try their pork fried rice which was excellent. 

Final Thoughts:
This review shouldn't stop you from coming but to be honest I found this place to be incredibly average. Come see for yourself if you're out in the area. 
That's what's up, meng.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite Ramen place in the OC. If you get their Ramen, you won't be disappointed. All the appetizers are great too. I usually get either gyoza, kimchi, fried tofu, or the takoyaki. Everything is very reasonably priced and the service is great. 

They are opened really late, but if you go late at night, be ready to wait in line.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm not a big ramen person, but I think the ramen here is good! They come in a variety of broths (soy sauce broth, miso, spicy miso, etc). I only tried their spicy miso and the broth is soo flavorful! The ramen noodle itself is ok, I prefer softer noodles, but I think the noodles they use are the authentic ones. Pretty much everything here is authentic and they have a variety of appetizers and side dishes. 

The Cha Shu Pork with ramen or rice is popular. I also like their Gyu Don beef rice bowl. The beef is really tender. Their homemade kimchi is sooo good! The seasoning is on-point! I love to add it as a side to any dish. 

I go here often for a quick meal after school since it's close. When I go by myself, I sit at the bar. The restaurant itself is small and there's often a wait for a table during lunch or dinner. It's great that they are open late for those late night cravings! The service is good; the waiters and waitresses are all attentive and nice. They also serve alcohol here (like soju) for those who need a drink with their meal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fast and friendly service,  and great food with good portion!

Our party ordered a number of items :

-Takoyaki: 5/5
- Karaage: 5/5 (chicken meat is juicy, yummy) 
-Various ramen: 4.5/5
- Black sasame ice cream: 5/5 (good portion for $2)
- Almond pudding: (4/5)

Overall a 5/5.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay avoid dinner time, prime lunch time or just any time there's a crowd. I've been eating here on and off for years since it's right off CSUF. Food is good and all, alright broth , great grilled meats.

When they're busy though prepare to be forgotten and have your meal time extended. It took over 10 minutes to just get water, and I don't mean someone actually giving you water but someone coming over and ask you what you wanted to drink. Actually getting a water took much longer, it came with when the food arrived, which was much much later. O_o

It was busy so I understand if drinks aren't always refilled. What really knocks down the stars is that the service system is kinda a mess. I don't think the wait staff have designated part or whatever bc they were all over and I guess just assume you had already been served by someone else. In my bill. I was over charged by multiple bowls of ramen. Like a waitress literally printed out and handed me a check for 4+ overcharges/meal items and walks off. After waving some one down and to fix it, I watched at least 3 other groups, including the group whose order was supposedly mixed in with mine, that came in after me finish and leave. 

When I was finally sorted they just kinda left and forgot about me and my payment, again. So in total my meal took almost 2 hrs, and it consisted mostly of me waiting while already seated.

Like food is good and all, especially for the area, I love the aromatic grilled meats and lunch combos but it's just not worth the mess.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Slave girl was meeting me for lunch at work and really wanted ramen. I have searched all around and what's up men surfaced from yelp with its great rating in Fullerton.

For a huge plaza, parking was actually challenging during lunch time but not impossible. After you get to the restaurant, they have a wait list outside by the door. You don't have to talk to anyone, just put down your name and magically you will be called when it's your turn. The wait wasn't too bad especially if you have slave girl around to keep you busy. Since it's a ramen place, most people are in and out anyway. 

We ordered soy sauce broth combo with curry rice, spicy miso broth combo with chashu rice, and octopus balls.

COMBO DOES NOT COME WITH EGG AT THIS PLACE and they charge you a dollar for one egg. They do this on purpose and they know it too because our nice server asked us if we wanted to order egg on the side since it doesn't come with the combo.

The food came to our table within 5 min after we ordered, that's speedy as hell. Octopus balls was done really well, flavorful and fluffy. Soy sauce broth was a hit for me but I am not a big fan on the spicy miso. Matter of fact, I believe it was the spicy paste on top that I didn't like because the broth tasted great before the paste was mixed in. The biggest dissatisfied thing was the chashu. It wasn't processed well and still had that pork stink taste. We tried mine, hers, the one in chashu rice, and they all had that and it wasn't pleasant.

Service was fantastic at this location. Our tea was refilled all the time without asking. When I asked for extra pickled radish for my curry rice, they brought back a handful with a smile. All and all, a great place to go for comfort food especially they open late.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down my go to Ramen spot!! You can't go wrong here. I always order the spicy miso or just the miso and add one their many hot sauces!! Trust me Ramen here never disappoints.

Also for whatever reason they're always playing Raggae  mixes which is cool but surely odd since it's a Japanese spot. It's cool with me,something different!!

Btw they always have the special where If you show them a post of yours on social media you get extra noodles,so take advantage of that!! Just be careful,you  will stuff your face!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious ramen and great staff. Wait times may be long, but worth it. Veggie friendly, but do not offer veggie broth :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So happy I found this place, and what is even better is the location, it is right by campus. I was first introduced to Ramen a few years ago and absolutely fell in love. I started going to Cal State Fullerton, and I was so stoked when I saw this place. 

The first time I came here I ordered the vegetable Ramen. I was reunited once again with ramen and it felt so good! Second time I was just craving a teriyaki chicken bowl and that did not disappoint either! The chicken was soooo tender in the chicken bowl, it is just how I like my chicken. Comes with white rice, chicken (good size), teriyaki sauce, green onions and sesame seeds.  . 

Great flavor, great prices, great service! 

Advice: Make sure you come hungry because portions are very generous.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love that this spot opens late (about 1am) .. And is local.... Service is always good every time I'm here.  They have Yelp check ins too.. Free extra noodles.. I also get mine Togo because its delish!! 

This is a pretty small spot.. And it tends to get packed pretty fast..they have many ramen options and also appetizers and rice bowls.. I always get the aka ramen which is the spicy miso and it hits the spot.. The broth is flavorful and the noodles are cooked to my liking..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really don't see the big deal about this place. But you should definitely CHECK IN TO GET FREE EXTRA NOODLES. 

The wait is pretty ridiculous. 45 minutes for 2 people?! At least they had a heater for the cold weather. But not only is the wait long, the space inside is SMALL. (btw, it's next to Pieology, in a corner area) there's an "L" bar shape that seats about 8-9 people. And there's 6 tables?

FOOD: I got the Koro Ramen ($8.50) and it was basic. Basic taste. I think with the extra noodle, it just overweighed everything else. The noodle is a thicker rounder noodle and was alright. The egg was still cold so you definitely need to drown it and mix your bowl really well. The broth had a bit of garlic but it just didn't compliment the taste. 

Overall, just wasn't as good as I expected. Fun fact: they play a lot of Reggae music & usher love songs haha. Probably not coming back here - definitely wasn't worth the wait in the cold.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What's up ramen noodle is great late night food! Nothing but crap food places are open late at night - with the exception of this place. Super tasty ramen. As a plus it's very affordable! 
I have to say the music is so random though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've already written a review so I'll keep this one short. I tried the chuka-soba and it was A1. it tastes exactly like the ones in Japan no joke. 

I highly recommend the chuka-soba to anyone who wants to taste the chuka-soba like the ones in Japan. 

it was super refreshing and the egg was on point. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!! 
other than that we ordered the fried rice and noodles. they were both excellent as well!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best ramen house around. The broths are fantastic and the homemade gyoza are great. The kimchee Fried rice is a must have.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Solid ramen shop in an unexpected location. Ramen is good as is the fried rice. Expect a wait during the weekend. Pretty cool that they stay open late on weekends.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My cousin took me here when I was in town. She said usually they have a long wait but when we came for dinner, the wait wasn't too bad. It's a cuts small place that serves some delicious food.

We ordered some ramen and if you check in you can get 1 free noodle refill to your broth which was great although we were too full to add more. I ordered the takoyaki which was amazing! Great portions and good price. The chicken karaage was also good. They have a bunch of great items on the menu that I wanted to try.

I would definitely come back here when I'm in the area. Server was so friendly and food was satisfying. Great place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One our favorite go to places for comfort food. Portions are filling, service is friendly! Weekday lunch specials are the best - ramen and curry rice! Yum! Only complaint is the wait during busy hours but that just tells you how good this place is! Go off hours if possible. Highly recommended! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Overall dining experience was excellent. Great price, great food and excellent friendly service!!!

We had Teriyaki Chicken bowl, Vegetable Ramen and Pork Ramen. 

We will definitely be back!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Whats up men? With the usual late night ramen cravings that I have, me and some friends drove to Fullerton to try this place out. I come from Torrance where there is A LOT of ramen places, and so I wanted to try out some other places in other cities. 

Heading out here at 12 a.m. it was nice that this place was open until 1. I was excited after reading some reviews about this place, and had to try it myself. 

I walked in and this place was fully packed with a lot of people so I had good expectations for this place.

I ordered the shoyu tonkotsu and was excited. However, once I actually tried it, I was a little dissapointed. Maybe it's cuz I'm spoiled with good ramen near my home area and LA, but no I think definitely the quality was not up to par.

Lets start with the broth, the broth has some flavor, buts it's lacking a certain depth to the tonkotsu. The broth is one of the most important parts of the ramen, and even though it wasn't the worst, it was off from my standards. Now the egg, that was alright, marinated, not as soft boiled as I would like it, but that's more of a luxury at ramen places for them to get it perfectly soft boiled. The noodles were not too bad but nothing spectacular. 

The biggest flaw in their ramen though is the chashu. Chashu should be marinated for hours and slowly cooked as to be tender. Every ramen place I've been too, no matter which one, made some kind of decent chashu. Some more flavorful, some more tender, but I have never encountered such a dry flavor less piece of chashu before. I was at first impressed by the size, and a little off put by how it looked, but once I bit into it, I was dissapointed.

However, overall I think this place has good potential for growth, if they can improve their broth a bit more and definitely work on the chashu a lot, I could see my self giving this place 4 stars.

Also, with the topping choices they chose, I personally didn't like the fact that they added bean sprouts, I just don't think it went well with it. But that might just be my preference so yea.

Oh and one final thing to add to this long review, if you post a photo on social media and get 5 likes you get extra noodles. So that was nice. Good marketing on their part.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food here is pretty good. There tends to be a long wait during the later hours, but there is always room at the bar if you want to just get your food and eat. I get the AKA Ramen which is pretty much spicy miso with garlic oil, and the broth is pretty flavorful. The broth is a bit oilier than Kopan Ramen which is down the street. The Kuro ramen is very weird tasting. It tastes like chinese soy sauce and doesn't have that shoyu taste of Japanese ramen. Takoyaki is also very good as the octopus is cooked perfectly and not overcooked. 

Overall, this place is good if you are craving ramen and don't want to wait too long for your food. The service here is alright. I may just be the culture of the servers but they seem a bit rude at times but I don't think they mean to be. 

There are only 2 ramen restaurants in fullerton, and I would come back because there isn't a long line out the door to sit at the bar. I don't believe in waiting an hour to eat ramen especially if you are really hungry.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">UNSANITARY!!!!!!!!!!! Food was greasy, mediocre and overpriced for ramen.. BEST part was that the kitchen is in the dining area so we could see how the cooks mistreat the food with their bare hands.. none had gloves even though there was a glove box there. They put some chicken on a plate and realized it was too greasy and the cook decides to tip it over on his bare hands to drip the grease off the plate. As the waitresses look in disgust at what he did, she continues to take the plate and serve it. DISGUSTING.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Only tried this place once but it was pretty good and cheap $8-11. Pretty small place with a few tables, but I came early on a Friday probably right when it opened (we skipped breakfast and Yelped all the opening hours of several places ha). 

I got the tonkotsu shiro (salt flavor) and asked for a side of spicy miso paste and added fresh garlic (yasssssss). It had rich/good flavor without adding anything though. 

The service was fast and our waiter was nice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">WARNING!:  If you have hypertension or hypernatremia, walk away.



Review:  This place was good!  I did a P90X workout and an Insanity workout and I was looking for my post-workout cancellation meal that helps me gain back my Calories burned.  .  This place was pretty good ramen.  I got the Kuro with extra pork.  The ramen was pretty tasty actually, and it tasted surprisingly better without extra soy sauce.  I made sure to be really careful and only put the soy sauce in the spoon with ramen in it, just in case.  Lol.  Okay, I'm giving it a 4-star cause I'm comparing it to other Ramen places that I've been to like Ippudo and Totoramen which are both from NYC.  I think their ramen is a little better because their pork is fuller and tastier.  Ippudo has the best Pork Buns too btw.  Anyways, the ramen here is something I would go back to over and over again until I get diagnosed with hypertension 4-stars!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service! Seated fairly quickly even though the place is super small. The food is fantastic! The recommendations were spot on.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Got the Reimen (Cold ramen; summer special) and it was PERFECT on a hot afternoon. The broth was light and refreshing. Never seen kimchi in ramen before but it was really good with the pork belly. 
The restaurant is very small and there is always a wait. Worth it though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">On our way home from Disneyland, our party was craving ramen and found this place had good reviews and fairly cheap ramen. Near CSUF, What's Up Men is a small shop in the corner of a plaza. There was plenty of parking when we arrived a little past 10pm. The wait was not too long and must've been about 15 minutes before we were seated. The bar area is not recommended if you place on ordering a lot of food since the space is quite little.

I'm surprised that a place that prices about $8 a bowl is this good. I'm assuming it's to cater to CSUF students but it's a huge plus for some of us outsiders. I ordered a small Saporro (only $3.50), karaage, and the shiro broth with a side of bean sprouts and corn. I wish the karaage were cut smaller but the meat was very well marinated and juicy. The shiro was delicious: the broth (I think tonkatsu?) was rich, the noodles were soft, and the egg was boiled just enough to still have that liquid yolky center. The side of bean sprouts they gave for only 50¢ was big enough to share with my party of three. The service is actually quite good for how busy they are. The servers are quick to take orders and quite attentive during the meal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Authentic, decent priced ramen shop. The portions are average. Not too big, not too small. Definitely had room for a dessert afterwards, but didn't leave hungry or dissatisfied. The broth was very filling, comforting, and yummy! A little small, and the wait time for a 4pm lunch was about 20 minutes, which isn't terrible considering we've seen lines queued up for an hour or more. The sides are a little expensive ( $2 for a small plate of kimchi ) and the egg wasn't the tastiest thing in the world, but it didn't subtract from my experience. Simply didn't add anything.

We'll be back, but maybe not loyal regulars. (:<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Food vs. Price: The ratio of Food:Price is pretty good. My friend and I ordered two small dishes and it came out around $10 and the quality was good for that price.

The Service: Not bad. They checked with us about every 15-20 min, were really friendly, and accommodating. One of them accidentally spilled half a pitcher of water all over my pants, but mistakes happen. They offered us free dessert as an apology; my friend readily accepted it.

The Parking: Plenty of space.

Overall: I would definitely come back to try out more of the food. Perhaps I'd wear swimming shorts this time, though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was in dire need of soup to help me recover from a night of heavy drinking and saw this place was close by so I called in to order for pick up.  My order was ready within 15 minutes. I ordered the spicy miso ramen and a california roll.  I was a bit hesitant to order ramen to-go but it wasn't all that bad 

I heated up the broth again once I got home before adding it to my bowl of noodles.  The broth was full of flavor but a little too salty and thick for my taste.  It was a pretty heavy broth.  I usually drink alot of the broth but I just couldn't with this one.   The noodles were thin with just the right amount of firmness.  It also comes with bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, scoop of spicy miso paste, slices of chasu, and half of a soft boiled egg.  The chasu was tender and thick, and I really enjoyed the soft boiled egg.  Not much to say about the California roll but I liked that they put in alot of imitation crab to the roll.  

Overall, its a decent bowl of ramen! The establishment itself is very small and located next to a busy Pieology so I can imagine there being a wait during it's peak hours.  Parking is scarce but it's in a huge complex so you can always park a little further and just walk.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Considering there were not many food options at 11pm, hubby and I decided to check out this ramen joint close to CSUF since we are new to this area. We show up and it is busy! But the wait wasn't too bad and they work pretty efficiently so we were seated rather quickly. 

Hubby and I weren't super hungry so we decided to share the Tonkatsu shoyu ramen and teriyaki chicken. At first we weren't sure if they'd be cool about us sharing a ramen because we have been to a place where they charged extra to share a bowl, gut they were very nice and even gave us an extra bowl and utensils. Teriyaki was very tender and juicy, and you get a good amount of chicken smothered in sauce. The ramen was pretty good, though lotsa bean sprouts, but rather tasty broth.

Service was very fast and attentive. We got our food rather quickly. 

So far no complaints. So why the 3 stars?!?!

Well both of us woke up in the middle of the night (and mind you we normally do not do this) with extremely dry mouth and an unquenchable thirst which only means one thing: too much MSG!

If you are cool with MSG, then by all means try it out but hubby and I will have to pass next time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food here was amazing. I wish they had ramen with chicken already in it instead of an add on, but that's ok. The food was amazing. The staff was also very helpful. Whenever I am in Anaheim I will visit this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to this place about 30 times or so and I've tried everything on the menu. Hands down my favorite in the Fullerton area. Shio ramen is my favorite here because it's light and balanced; a good break from most ramen shops with heavy/greasy pork broths. 

Among the delicious menu, they are an authentic ramen shop open until 1AM with good specials. Their lunch specials pretty much gives you an extra entree on top of a bowl of ramen (but it does not come with an egg though so make sure to order that separate if you're ordering lunch).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my go to ramen joint. My boyfriend and I always go late after work because they close at 1 am :) the ramen is amazing!!!!! I love watching the chefs make the ramen behind the bar and the chashu pork don buri is to die for!!!! Must try it !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First off, it's a smaller place so be prepared to wait! We got the Aka and Shiro ramen and an
order of chicken karagge. The ramen bowls are HUGE (like 2.5x the size of a normal one) and they come with a lot of different things in the soup. Both the soups were pretty flavorful, I liked the spicy miso better. They both sort of lacked a strong umami flavor that I was really looking for though. The karagge was pretty good, but had some tendons and cartilage that I wasn't too fond of. Maybe it was a bad day. I was actually sort of disappointed because a lot of people I know like this place! I will definitely give it another try though and try more things on their menu<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3-stars at best.  Gets crowded quickly.  For me, it was not worth the wait.  Here are the highlights of my experience.

I ordered the AKA (Spicy Miso) Ramen.  Broth was pork flavored with a scoop of spicy chili paste.  Nothing fancy.  The bowl had one-piece of pork.  Broth tasted okay, but it was a little on the salty side.  Was not spicy at all.  Disappointed that they don't ask customers how firm they want their noodles, or whether you wanted extra noodles when you were finished.

Ordered the gyoza at the same time as the ramen, and the gyoza came out super quick.  The ramen came out close to 30-minutes after we finished the gyoza.  All the ice had melted in our water cups, which took forever for someone to come by and offer refills.

Parking is not friendly in this plaza.  If you're lucky, you can get right up in the front.  Else, you have to share the lot with plenty of other food establishments. 

Overall, the food was okay.  The wait was terrible.  Service can definitely be better.  If you're in the CSUF area, and looking for some decent ramen, check this place out.  If you're looking for Hakata style ramen, you won't find it here.

Enjoy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We ordered ramen & Goyza delicious 
Great service , friendly staff ! 
Place is small waiting list , Be prepared to wait 
Well worth the wait<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best Japanese noodles in my area. Sucks because it's always packed throughout the day especially late at night when the cravings kick in. Haven't found anything comparable with the variety offered. Love their soup base.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Me and boyfriend love eating at this place. I normally get the champon. It is yummy! I normally order extra noodles as it lets me take home a meal for later.

The waitresses are super nice!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The ramen here is the best ramen I've ever had !  My gfs opinion was spot on.  Worth the wait.  Make sure u get 5 social media likes to get a extra plate of that fresh ramen !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service, the waitress and staff were super friendly and informative. They thoroughly explain the menus. I see why there is a wait now at this restaurant. Unfortunately it was super cramped, a little rushed but I totally understand why it would be those things. Over all great restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food but very small restaurant.  try the gyozas!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They have good takoyaki that definitely satisfied my craving.  I tried their spicy miso ramen, which was not that spicy.  Unfortunately, chose the hottest day to eat ramen.  They gave plenty of water but the place was super hot inside and stuffy.  They did try to get customers to sit away from the windows, which was nice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always wait for at least 15 minutes whenever i come to eat. The food and service were both good tho. Pretty decent price for a ramen place. 4.5/5? Mhmmm<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a nice spot to have ramen. Texture of the noodles is most important to me when it comes to ramen. The taste should mostly come from the broth and toppings, so I have to say that the noodles here are on par. 

The broth I would give it 3-4 stars. I don't mind the saltiness, but over here is just a tad bit saltier than usual. The vibe is awesome. It would be nice if the place were bigger, but then it is surrounded by a few college campuses which is understanding.  Service is very good here, I would come back for more.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've found the best Tonkotsu Ramen restaurant! I was in Anaheim, and was so hungry. But that was 3pm, and I didn't want heavy meal cuz I'm supposed to go out with my husband tonight. So I thought of Ramen, but most of Japanese restaurants are closed between 2 and 5:30. So I Yelped it, and found that this place is open all day! It's even open till 1am! 7days a week! I ordered Cha (means brown in Japanese. Miso flavored tonkotsu ramen) It's the best Tonkotsu Ramen! Boiled egg was perfectly soft boiled, pork is tender, green onions are amazingly thin sliced and the broth, which is the key ingredient of Tonkotsu ramen, is perfect! I'm happy that I came even further out of my way. Though I had a hard time finding this tiny place. It's close to the intersection in the shopping center, right next to Pi-ology. I want to come back and try other stuff like Champon, seafood Ramen. I highly recommend this place. Oh I almost forgot to write about service! Atmosphere is casual, young and hip with up beat music. Servers are all young girls. But when I leave, one of them opened the door for me with a big smile!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So wonderful! Great ramen for a great price. Came here with a friend we waited for a bit but it was well worth it. We sat at the bar and ordered right away. We got to see the freshly prepared dishes right in front of us. Ordered extra fish cakes and crispy onions to enhance my ramen and had no regrets. So yumm. I will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Called my order in and was ready in 15 minutes. Ordered the Cha Ramen.  The broth was full of flavor and the ramen noodles cooked al dente. There was even extra soup that I cooked my own noodles for the day after.  

Small place with bar seating. I would highly recommend and come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Our favorite place for Japanese cuisine! The curry is fantastic, all the delicious ramens, great appetizers & excellent customer service always. We were sitting next to people who come from South County just to wait in line here. Worth it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've come here twice in the same week so that should say something about how much I like this place lol. 
The servers are very courteous and welcoming, interesting music plays, and I feel calm here. 
On Friday I can't eat meat so I got the veggie ramen but it strangely had meat in it, I brushed it off and gave the meat to my friend. 
Last Wednesday i came with a group of 6 and we could only split the check up to 4 but it's understandable. I got the kuro ramen with extra chashu and noodles, it's good but next time I'll get the mapo don beef bowl just cuz :p. 
Their promotional ad is pretty handy if you're super hungry (get 5 likes minimum on social media to get free extra noodles) totally worth.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of my best friends showed me this place and I'm in love with their Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl. I'm not a fan of Ramen even though it's their specialty. 

If you're a fan of Yoshinoya this is basically a better version of their Beef and Teriyaki Chicken Bowls. The only downfall for me is that you can't substitute the toppings that come with the bowls with another topping, so if you wanted a certain topping that are .50, you would have to pay for it. 

it does get busy and it is a fairly small location but overall worth it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Small restaurant, fills up quick so get there early! I got the spicy miso ramen and was impressed with how flavorful and rich it was, I would highly recommend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was hungry, they open till late night, i saw internet, i go, i sit, i order, i got the food, i got full, im happy. Recommended<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love ramen. I don't think this place has top notch ramen but it's probably the best around. I prefer really creamy tonkotsu ramen but I like the miso ramen here. It's delicious. They have great chashu that falls apart easily. The lunch special they have is so worth it and the social media thing is great too. I'll come back if I'm too lazy to drive further for ramen.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">By far the best ramen in the area. Everyone who works here is super nice. All the employees greet you when you walk in. Everything Ive had here has been beyond good. I come here everytime Im in the area. The only downside, and its really a compliment to the restaurant, isnits always packed unless you come in right when they open. Even 30 mims after they open, theres a line out the door. Do yourself a favor and come here asap. You wont be disappointed. Whats up men is the freaking best!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've never had ramen before so my friends decided to bring me here. I can honestly say I haven't been this satisfied in a long time! I got the choka soba (not sure if I spelled correctly). Also got extra noodles with the social promo of 5 likes or more. Waitresses are very nice and I like the whole vibe of the restaurant; they were playing reggae music! Definitely coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place the best Ramen in North Orange County by far. The spicy miso broth will make you feel like you are in Tokyo, absolutely top-notch and completely authentic. Do not miss out on the Japanese style kimchee!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The best ramen! I ordered a takeout but someone picked up my order. They were not sure if I called  so I had to show them my recent call log on my phone. Then they made a new one for me! Great soup and it opens late. I was there at 10.30 on Friday night. There was still a long line. Good decision to order a takeout.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not the best but the most efficient.

I never waited more than 10 minutes to get seated here unlike other Ramen locations in SoCal. The menu is simple and they have some nice deals like "Buy a Beer get an Appetizer for $1". 

Ramen itself is just okay. Really heavy broth but lacks flavor. I usually order the Aka Ramen and end up having to add more chili powder to get that kick. I get full more than halfway through with the Aka Ramen and I'm sure thats because of the heavy broth. 

The noodles itself were decent at best. Unlike other Ramen shops, this was was all tangled and uneven. This made it impossible to "slurp" the noodles.

I do love how quick the Ramen comes out, how they all come with all the little tidbits that you would have to pay extra for at some other locations, and how welcoming the servers are.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Broth isn't as flavorful as other places I've been to. The ramen I chose was the Cha which is miso based. The combo was with gyoza and fried rice. I tried Bry's Aka ramen which was spicy and better than mine. They have a shin sengumi type of atmosphere with the yelling Japanese phrases.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good solid ramen spot near CSUF.  Workers were super friendly and most spoke Japanese.  Their broth was good and ramen was tender.  The only downside was the one piece of pork belly.  Usually you get 2 -3 slices but maybe it was lunch.  Their combination lunch is a great deal.  I tried their curry and gyoza.  Both were great. I must add the gyoza was freshly made not the frozen kind you buy at the store.  Good lunch spot<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A must stop every time we go to Disneyland!!! Must try the takiyaki and chukka,  cha , and teas.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They might be known for their delicious ramen, but their curry rice is absolutely amazing too! Throw in a small bowl of chicken soup and top it off with crispy, savory takoyaki and my late night food run is complete. They are fast and super friendly, and the atmosphere is never too loud. This is definitely my favorite ramen restaurant in Orange County.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everyone is a food critic now-a-days right? 
I really like this place! It's good, cheap, open late, and good service. What more can you really ask for? It's ramen for Christ's sake. Do you want the noodles to come out and dance for you? It's yummy and tasty. Five stars for me and I don't even like ramen. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Truly great and unique (unique for this area).  I don't frequent many noodle places because although many traditional Asian/Pacific Island noodle recipes take hard work,  the resulting flavors tend to be simple. 

However,  What's Up Men provides complex dishes with great flavors and textures.  I had the Aka,  a spicy miso broth noodle with pork,  and it was excellent.  Also I ordered the Fried Chicken side,  which was very crunchy, freshly hot,  and accompanied with some good sauces.  And the ice tea was some of the best I've had.  

Also the staff were very friendly and the restaurant had an urban charm.  An added plus is that they are open beyond midnight making them a great alternative to late night fast food.  I have been converted to this wonderful noodle joint.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lucked out when coming here and only had to wait less than 10 min for a party of 3 at the bar. We came on a Saturday around 8:30pm. The place is pretty small and located next to the pieology. 

I ordered the Kuro ramen ($8.50) which is a tonkatsu shoyu pork based broth. I thought the broth was a little fatty for my taste. My S.O. ordered the Aka ramen ($9.25) - a spicy miso pork based broth. I actually preferred the flavor of the Aka ramen, but I didn't think it was very spicy. I would say it was more mild than spicy. 

For the portion size I thought it was a little overpriced. They didn't have different size options either which was weird to me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Amazing ramen, amazing customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">El Niño calls for ramen! Second time here. Because of the rain and small waiting area (lack of), customers were asked to wait outside. Some waited in their cars. I was hesitant to, fear of not getting a phone call.

The wait was a little longer than expected. Food was fast and tasty. Got the Aka Ramen. A little short on the meat. Maybe I forgot to ask for an egg? Service was superb. The lunch special was perfect - soup and appetizer.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of my favorite Ramen places. Reasonable prices, delicious, and staff always friendly and efficient. A little crowded, but it's not that big of an issue. Love that they stay open late!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I don't consider myself an Udon expert but I do love my noodle soups. While What's Up Men is no Santouku Ramen, it definitely hits the spot, particularly on a cold winter night. Plus their service is friendly and they do the traditional greeting when customers enter and exit so it's exciting. 

Broth is good. And servings are pretty large. I don't usually finish my bowl.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hehehe, this place! I've had such half and half experiences. The service was amazing then I went back and had a bad experiences. Regardless about the serviced the main topic is the food!!! I adore the broth here, the ramen is glorious. I feel like I'm in a dream. This was actually the first ramen place I ever fell in love with. I didn't like ramen before I went here, and eating here changed my interest in ramen and opened up a lot of doors for me and my interest in ramen. I will never forget it, this is my fave ramen spot in OC<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here so many times and still delicious  as always. Great service, great vibe and great food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">rip off. two little slivers of pork. why???? seriously. but taco yaki was good. everything else nah. not worth in my opinion. over hyped.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We came here last night with friends. All of us ordered apps. My gf wasn't impressed with the apps they ordered but her hubby was raving. I ordered the Cha Shu pork app and my hubby ordered Buta and Kim. My app came with 4 super thin slices of pork over a mound of bean sprouts. Good but I felt ripped off. Hubby's was ok. We all ordered ramen (both chicken and pork broth versions) and we were all pretty happy with the ramen broth and noodles but we all felt ripped off with the amount of meat offered. There were 3 super thin slices of pork. The rest were fillers. You get more bang for your buck at Ajisen. However the kids all wolfed down their food, even our friends finicky eater so that's a plus. 

The ambience is a good vibe and they had reggae on rotation which is always a win in my book. I was nodding my head, dancing in my seat, and singing along the whole time. Would come again just for the music and vibe.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good option for students around here, since it's so close to CSUF.  I still think Kopan Ramen is better if you're in the area.

I had the kuro (tonkotsu) ramen, and the broth was so fattyy.  The flavor was there, but I was gasping for water at the end of the meal.  I couldn't even finish my soup.  I love that the egg is soft boiled!  What's different from Kopan is that the ramen already comes with toppings.  If you wanted extra other than the chashu meat at Kopan, you'd have to pay for it.  But I really didn't like all the bean sprouts!  Go easy on that, jeez.  My friend had the aka (spicy miso), and it was spicy!  I thought mine tasted better though.  

This establishment is tiny, so expect lines.  It's also really tight; you can listen on the table next to you, and they can definitely hear your conversations, too.  Also, because it's so busy, expect service to be slow.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have come here many times trying out different things on the menu. I have to say after getting the Chashu Bowl, the Aka, and the cold noodles, the Aka is the one for me. It is not spicy at all and adds a lot of flavor. It was $9.25 and it is amazing!

It had the perfect amount of flavor where I don't really need to add anything to the ramen. I LOVE the egg and have never tasted such a delicious egg ever before in my life. The broth was just right and eating this during the cold is the best.

In conclusion, great service and great food! I recommend the Aka. 

If you check in, you also get one free extra noodle.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">- Gluttony Expedition - 
Mabo tofu bowl: too salty, too little tofu, a little spicy. Nothing memorable. 

Fried chicken: big portion, a bit greasy. It's just ok. 

Kimchi fried rice: a bit salty, bland. Meh. 



- Conqueror's Deduction - 
Edible but nothing here is memorable. 
It's just no other option for Japanese food at late night.. Sigh.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was craving ramen for dinner while I was in Anaheim. After hanging out at the Packing District during the afternoon, my GFs cousin recommended this spot. This is located in a nice spot in the college area of Fullerton. What's Up Men is small and the wait was less than 10 min although I've heard that it's usually longer than that.

We ordered the Kuro Ramen (Tonkotsu Shoyu), Takoyaki, and Chicken Karaage. Everything we ordered tasted pretty authentic and I'm really picky when it comes to ramen especially their broth, which was pretty good.

Small spot but the service was great. I'd definitely come back here for some ramen!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Coworkers wanted to get some late night food after a closing shift so we decided to try this place. 

Located near CSUF, the restaurant itself is pretty small. We had to wait a little while because a party of 10+ decided to stay/chat after their meal. The workers there are really friendly; smiles all around. 

I got the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen which has a pork/soy sauce-based broth. Pork slices were extremely tender and the egg with the soft yolk was perfect. Only con for me was that the broth had a little pungent pork taste but it was still tasty. 

Good spot for the late night crowd.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Blessed with ingenious marketing, What's Up Men is the go to place for CSUF students to get their ramen on. It is close to the campus which attracts the college crowd. However, proximity does not necessarily entail quality. 

The ramen tastes like packets of Maruchan, but in a good way. It's savory, but the ramen is somewhat hard. Usually at ramen places they ask for the firmness of the noodle, but this place takes chances. The broth is nothing special, definitely not Shin Sen Gumi worthy. 

I also tried the Kim-chi fried rice. It tasted like fried rice with just a hint of kimchi. Not worth getting, especially if you love the kimchi taste. 

The takoyaki were also disappointing. They were lukewarm and no squid on top. Who doesn't put squid on top of takoyaki? The gall of some places

Overall, this place is the only option for ramen. Go here if it's your last resort.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">LOVED eating here. Had the Kuro ramen (pork/soy sauce broth) with my free Extra Noodle for checking in. Loved my soda in the can with a cup of ice, can always tastes better then fountain. The broth was very good and the noodle with the perfect firmness. Good slices of pork that were flavorful and tender.  

We were sitted quickly, order taken promptly, food came out in good time. They were packed and the wait staff was doing there job serving everyone efficiently. 

Would come back again! Next time I'm down south.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really love this place. Along with the service. It's kinda strange at first how close you are sitting next to a stranger but you get used to it. Open till 1am. All the waitresses are super cute. Ramen was amazing and they have deals on beer. I think it's $2 with ramen. Not totally sure but I knew it was cheap. So all in all this is a great place for late night ramen cravings.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Super friendly staff every time. Amazing food. Order the pork fried rice, you won't regret it. So so good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for the first time yesterday with a friend. The place is fairly small and had to wait outside until our party was called. Unfortunately, it was raining outside, but I didn't mind since this place was worth the wait. 

I ordered the Kuro made of pork broth and found it to be quite delicious. The broth was light and adequately salted so it didn't feel as though it weighed me down upon finishing it. This is a plus for me because I'd be stricken with "food coma" after eating such meals, but I was able to study and stay productive. 

In the end, I'll be coming back to this restaurant. Despite its limited space, I'm fond of the hustle and bustle within it which, in my opinion, adds to a better dining experience.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They're so many good ramen restaurants in Fullerton, and I've decided that what's up men is one of my favorites.  I really like their broth, it's full of flavor, but not too heavy. the noodles are just right, and the apps are delicious.  Also, the service is beyond excellent.  There is always a wait, but in my experience, never much more than 5 minutes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very mediocre ramen with a single piece of charsiu. I believe this is the place that only gave me one. single. piece. of charsiu....

I would've been fine if soup and noodles made up for it but no... another mediocre ramen place... 

Not worth the drive tbh.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I absolutely love this ramen joint! Great food and great service! Service is so fast here. This is definitely one of my go to ramen spots in all of the OC. It's not even the closest one, but so worth the drive! 

They have lunch combos you can choose from if you're extra hangry. Choices including small beef bowl, fried rice, chicken-teriyaki, etc.

I always get the AKA ramen. It's a spicy miso based ramen. Soooooooo good!!! I love this place!! 

This place is highly recommended!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Looooove the spicy miso broth, DELICIOUS! I always get extra pork belly, so good and affordable :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of my favorite ramen shops. I love the Shiro (salt) ramen and the pork fried rice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Aka ramen was good and my family enjoyed their bowls as well. Service for the most part was excellent, but I have to say I'm a little disappointed because it's 90 degrees outside but they made us wait outside in the sun with no seating provided. The table we sat at by the window had no flow of AC and was very hot. After our meal I mentioned to the waiter that we saw the promo outside that if it's 90 degrees or hotter, we receive free ice cream. When I checked the temperature, it was 89, at which point the waiter spoke to someone else and said they couldn't give us the ice cream. I mean come on...really? Small and minor disappointment for an otherwise good meal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First off, I've been coming here for 3 years or so. It was love at first bite for me. I've brought friends in to try and they have all become very loyal customers. This year I decided to go on a 2 month break from high sodium foods and got on a healthy eating regimen for a special occasion. After celebrating my diet victory, decided to order some ramen through door dash a few weeks back and it was super good. Came back 2 weeks later with a friend and something definitely has changed. The noodles are skinnier and doesn't absorb any of the broth flavor. I thought maybe I was going out of my mind so I asked the server if they changed the noodles and she said no that they are the same. Went back a week later and we both noticed that the noodles were too al dente, thin and flavorless. The broth wasn't even the same! It was lacking the flavor I fell in love with in the first place. My favorite AKA! Gone! I asked one of the servers if the owners changed and she said no.  I am puzzled and sad because this was a nice go-to place for late night food runs. Please bring back the old noodles and flavorful broth! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Much like the iPad mini that the servers were having a hard time using instead of the erasable simple order sheets you once had. Oh and music is great but the volume was obnoxious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place. I think the broths are delicious and their dip noodles are to die for!! I really like this place. Their noodles aren't really typical ramen noodles. They feel almost like instant ramen noodles, which I don't absolutely love, but their broth is really good. My boyfriend is not the biggest fan of this place, but I happen to love it. I don't know what it is about this place, but I've always enjoyed it. Perhaps it's because it's really our go to place for a late night meal (which my boyfriend and I are definitely victims of midnight munchies).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's not bad! And the place is open late for those mid night cravings on a rainy day

It's more Americanized though so if you're looking for authentic ramen you may want to try elsewhere<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Didn't have much expectations coming here, but I must say this is probably in the bottom tier of my ramen list.

My friend ordered the Soysauce Ramen (Kuro?), and it tasted pretty diluted.  I ordered the Aka, which is the Spicy Miso Ramen and while it has slightly more flavor than the soysauce ramen, it was still lacking in spice and savoriness.  I felt like it should've had more flavor especially since it had a spoonful of spicy miso paste and black garlic oil. They gave two thick slices of pork belly, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and half of a soft-boiled egg.  The soft-boiled egg was perfectly soft-boiled, but it was just a bit too marinaded in soy sauce for it actually tasted more like a tea egg.  There were too many bean sprouts so each bite had more bean sprouts than ramen noodles.  As for the bamboo shoots, I don't usually like bamboo shoots unless they are very cooked and taste similar to the broth.  Unfortunately this was not the case and so I gave the bamboo shoot to my friend. The gyoza was pretty good and I liked how they had a bunch of different condiments on the side, but nothing really wowed me.

I don't regret coming here because I love trying new ramen places, but I for sure prefer going to Shinsengumi or Daikokuya over this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The price was too high for the quantity and quality of food. $9.50 for a AKA ramen - the only spicy noodle in their entire menu. When I asked for extra spicy, the server said there'd be $1 more. I've never been to a place that charge $$ for extra spicy. And there was only TWO pieces of pork in a bowl. TWO. Are you serious?
There were not too many options of meat to pick. Only PORK.
Anyway, i won't come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here on a Sunday to try and satisfy my noodle soup craving. I had heard great things about this place and how it was a cheap and yummy spot to eat, and decided to give it a try. 

Located next to Pieology, it's in a corner that might be hard to spot, so I would advise to look for Pieology and it is to the right. 

Upon entering, I immediately noticed how small the establishment was! Maybe 9 spots at the bar, and I think there were 5 or 6 tables? Definitely there will be a wait if it's slightly packed or if it's lunch/dinner rush. 

Onto the menu. 
I ordered the original ramen (soy sauce broth, seaweed, fish cake, bamboo, and a slice of pork) as well as a side of fried calamari. 

Overall I thought the ramen was ok.
It was edible, had a decent amount of flavor, but there just seemed to be something lacking! I wasn't too fond of how they just gave you one piece of pork, and literally one piece of everything else. The broth was ehh, tasted like it came out of powder packaging, and the noodles were alright. I've tried Shin Sen Gumi and Ajisen, and it seems like a What's Up Men just couldn't compare! 

Service was decent. Brought food out on time, but they seemed more interested tending their own business instead of focusing on the customer (no water refilled, no coming around, chit chat with each other or wiping down washed dishes). 

I mean I would be back if I was a starving college kid in the area with no other choice - and if I was craving ramen, but there really are better options for a ramen in the OC, so I would pass on this one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fantastic food and service!
Favorite is the Chanpon (seafood and veggie ramen) with side of Cha Shu pork combo.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Loved it. Came in by myself after school and everyone greeted me. They took my order really quick, even though they were really busy. The spicy miso ramen ( AKA ) was very delicious. Great food and great service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Dude straight up says please wait outside, when it pouring buckets. So ended up waiting in the rain for 35 minutes. Ramen was pretty good, more pork would be better. The lunch special is well worth it i guess, customer service could be greatly improved.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Eh, not really a big fan. Parking and seating is pretty bad in the evening time. It's very packed in there most of the time. The broth isn't too good for my liking. Probably will not be back, but hey, maybe I'll give it another shot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best ramen around and closest location. Love going here the ramen is prepared right in front and everything is freshly made and delicious. One bowl always fills me up or some days I can't even finish so I end up taking the left over to go. But anyways place always have great tasting ramen and Gyoza. The fried rice is good too. The price is great too and worth the amount of food you get. 

I'm a returning a guest as well<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great little Ramen place near school. (Cal State Fullerton) Always busy, open late, and affordable. I will be eating there often.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely the best Ramen ever!  The whole menu looks delicious but I cannot stop ordering the Aka Ramen!!  The place is very small but I guess that adds to the ambiance.  The wait was about 30 minutes Sunday night after 9PM.  Once seated service is prompt.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent service. Very attentive and courteous. I ordered the cold ramen which was so tasty and perfect for a hot day. My picky son had the fried rice and loved it! Definitely recommend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My cousin and I came here around 6pm Saturday night and there was a long line waiting in front of us, but it's only took less than 2 minutes for us to get seats at the bar since other people wanted tables for their groups. If you don't want to wait, seat at the bar is the best option and plus you can watch Chiefs cooking in front of you. 

Parking: there are plenty of parking spot behind the restaurant, so finding where to park should not be a problem. 

Food:We ordered 2 Cha ramen with 2 extra eggs and corns, 1 Takoyaki.
Ramen was good and served in a big bowl, I couldn't finish all the noodles. The flavored soft boiled egg was delicious.
Takoyaki was bomb. The batter was melted inside my mouth. I recommend to eat it when it's hot.

Service: The waitress was friendly and nice. 

Bill:The total was $25-ish for 2 full stomachs .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What's up Men is a small restaurant that plays fun upbeat music! The service was super fast!

The broth was tasty, the chasu was alright.... It didnt have as much flavor, & the california roll was larger than typical.

I would go back because it does the job to fulfill your ramen craving! If you want something extra hip, this isnt your spot. If you want a simple ramen setting with fast service, this is for you :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good stuff. Came here because the portions looked good from yelp reviews. We weren't disappointed. The ramen is very basic and there are no real frills to it but it was really tasty. The few appetizers we got at the table were well done, one of the best takoyaki I've had. We will have to come here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OPEN TILL ONE AM! Haha I was straight sold on the business hours. We were driving back from vegas and it was extremely late at night but had such a huge craving for ramen. I ordered cha flavor based soup with a side of spicy oil and hot chili suace we also checked in and got the side of noodles. This really hit the spot. Something about having soup! Comfort zone ! Hah if you ever have a late night craving drop by.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have to agree with other Yelpers that the ramen here is good for the area, and good enough to fix my ramen craving. 

I've tried the miso, spicy (not very) miso, and soy ramen. All three were good but a tad overly seasoned.  I can see why some would say it's too salty. 

Service was friendly and efficient. The last time we went, it was below 40 degrees outside and everyone in Fullerton wanted ramen because the lines at all the ramen places were out the door!  After waiting outside near the heat lamp, I readily welcomed the steaming hot bowl of ramen that came with two fat slices of pork! That rarely happens. Someone must have been in a good mood. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The first time I came here I was not impressed and that's only because I have high standards when it comes to ramen. I myself have visited the motherland of this magnificent noodle concoction and fell deeply in love. Sadly, my favorite spots are not open late and when the love pains begin to emerge late in the evening, I find myself here. This is maybe my fifth time dining in and improvement has been noticed. The noodle and broth have both improved and I really enjoyed myself tonight. Speedy service and great appetizers to accommodate great noodle. I shall return! Aki was great to us and is hands down the best server I have had here. Thanks my brotha!<p>
</p></p>
