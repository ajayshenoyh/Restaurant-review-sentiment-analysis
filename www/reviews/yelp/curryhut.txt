<p itemprop="description">This is a fast, cheap, simple, casual, yummy Indian food place. You can tell it's a hit because it a lot of people go there. 

This is not buffet.
They have 1-3 item combos (all under $10) that come w rice and naan. 

We like how the combo items are not too creamy-rich. They have a good amount of spice! We like the goat curry, chicken spinach, and egg plant. 

You can tell the samosas are freshly hand made. The herbal flavors are evident as well. 

The mango lassi is very yogurt-thick. No pistachios added. 

This place is casual, no waiter service. 

This place is quick with good quality for its prices.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time having their food. I ordered online and found their website very easy to navigate. Their menu is simple and the food is well priced. I was craving something with a little spice so this place was perfect!

Ordering online was easy. It gives you pick up time options or an ASAP option. The ASAP said the order would be ready within 30 mins. I went about 15 after I placed the order and it was ready.

The food was amazing! I had a 2-combo plate and chose chicken tiki masala and tandoori chicken. It came with a ton of rice! The combo was supposed to come with naan, but I didn't get any...which was kinda sad, but the food was still really good! 

Will definitely come again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">whether they like it or not, they are in service business. I ordered my food. there was a line. I ordered 2 garlic nann to go along with my ala carte orders. the THREE people behind me got their garlic nans before I got mine. when I saw it, I went back to the counter and asked "I'm sorry, what happened to my garlic nann. they (I pointed at those people) already got theirs and they were behind me" she just said " he's packing your nann, mam" 
I waited for that goddamn nann for about 10 mins...!!! 
FAST FOOD? I THINK NOT!!!!!!

I have not even tasted the food yet, I don't care how good it is but you need to treat all customers the same and you need to process your orders in which you received.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious, but c'mon health department, do your job! Guy in back with full beard that was uncovered, then I saw him sneeze too. Yikes. Bathroom had no soap or toilet paper, and that's the employees' bathroom too - so you fill in the rest. 

No wonder my wife had a stomach ache thatvnight. 

I love Indian food and we've eaten at like a dozen mom and pop places around OC. And this place had delicious food. But they have to fix the health issues.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">O.M.G. this place is amazing! Don't let the looks of this place deceive you.

I ordered the 3 plate combo: Chicken Tikka Masala, Spinach and Cheese curry, and Vegetable curry; it automatically comes with rice. They were all delicious.

The Chicken Tikka Masala was a bit spicy but it was so worth my tongue being on fire and my nose being runny.

The Spinach and Cheese curry had the right amount of flavour.

The Vegetable curry was a bit sweet but tasty.

Also, pay a little more for thr Garlic Nan!! So worth it. 

Definitely coming back here again!

One last thing,  the place is a bit tiny so it's not good for big groups<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My wife and I drove all the way from LB and we didn't regret it at all! The food was amazing and at such an affordable price! (We shared a 3 item combo and it was plenty of food, if that's something you're interested in) 
But if you are thinking about checking this place, definitely do it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yelp challenge 2016

I'm not sure I'm as convinced as everyone else. Its kind of like internet dating. You see their picture and they look sooooooo darn good  but it was really a picture of them in their prime. Hey trust me, I did the internet dating in the 90s. That's what this reminds me of. The food looks soooo good, but the taste doesn't match the face.  Now that's just my opinion, because a lot of people like the food here. For me it was just meh. Located off East Chapman in Fullerton near 7-11 and Pita Hot. Just a handful of tables inside and a self serve soda machine. Don't drink a lot since their is no public bathroom. 

We ordered 2 of the 2 item combos for about $18.00. The vegetable korma was 90% cauliflower. The sauce was not very flavorful. Maybe it was an off night we all have them. Tikka Masala tasted like something was missing. Not as good as it could of been. The tandoori chicken was over cooked and was not the typical red color. It was more of a BBQ chicken. 

The only thing I really liked was the Garlic Naan. I guess I drove all the way here to eat Naan bread. Hey, that's okay, I used to drive 70 miles for one of my internet dates who I met in his prime. 

Just okay...not yet convinced. I'm hoping I just came on a off night.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As we get older, we grow more wary of the unknown. The night, which was once an invitation for fun and temptation, becomes a time and space of unease and uncertainty. Hemingway wrote about this, and how, as an old man, all he longed for was a clean and well lit place to escape the dark void of night.

I am not that old and I'm also no Hemingway, but I'm old at heart and there are times when I too long for a clean and well lit place. When that place also happens to serve bomb Indian inspired rice dishes at an amazing price point, then there is no choice but to celebrate this beautiful establishment.

Served cafeteria style, a one entree plate grants you a heaping pile of basmati rice, your choice of curry or other entr√©e, and two large pieces of naan. I love the tikka masala and the spinach curry. The food is piping hot and the aromatics of the spices are sublime, by the time you sit down, your salivating glands are firing on all cylinders.  With your favorite Dil Se joint playing in the background, it is time for the eating to commence.

Like I said before the establishment is super clean and things are kept in tip top shape. People of all ethnicities, ages, and just about any group of people you can think of stop by here to dine in or take out. Good food and a great price is a universal phenomenon all people can understand. And a clean and well lit place like here is something anyone can appreciate.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can survive on their garlic naan dipped in Tikka Masala for days~
I love Indian food because it's so flavorful with all the spices and Curry Hut offers some of the best curry around. Definitely order their combos; one item combo ($5.99), two item combo ($6.99) and three item combo ($7.99), which comes with 2 pieces of naan (upgrade to garlic naan for $0.50 extra) and rice. They give generous scoops of their curry for to-go orders, but you can always ask them to pour it over the rice for extra. I've tried most of their curry but my favorite is the tikka masala (mild spicy), veggies (mild spicy) and egg plant (very flavorful with a lot of spice). Their naan is always made fresh when you order. 

This is my go-to place for when I want to grab a quick order to go so I can rush home to continue my GoT binge-watch.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oh my goodness!!!!! Sooooooo goood!!! Great price with a friendly staff. Best garlic naan. Ask to try the veggie of the day we tried it after and wished we had ordered the lentils they were layered with rich complex spice. This place did not disappoint. Definitely will be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wish I could give it 3.5 stars. I ordered the palak paneer, potato and cauliflower two item combo. I think it is totally worth it to make the extra .50 for the garlic naan. The food over wall was good, but not great but I wasn't expecting a ton for a fast Indian joint. The naan was a little overdone and not the pillowy and fluffy naan I was hoping for. The restaurant has its quirks, the bright orange and green, that make it very welcoming, I guess(??) b I gave it 4 stars because it met my expectations more or less as a fast food Indian joint.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very authentic and affordable pricing. Not kidding, taste better than some restaurants I went.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Now, this hut is hot!

I do believe I've found a new favorite (with the help of the many respectable Yelpers who've come before me, of course.)  Immediately upon crossing the threshold, the flavorfully warm aroma of curry envelops you.  Chicken Tikka Masala, Goat Curry, Tandoori Chicken: so colorful and inviting, savory and rich...

...and fast!

One- and two-order combos are certainly available, but why stop there?  Get a three-order.  After all, you'll probably want to taste a bit of everything anyway.  And besides, naan--honestly, my favorite reason to enjoy Indian food--comes paired with your meal.  Whether plain or with Parmesan and garlic, naan--puffy, lightly browned, and buttery--deserves being introduced to multiple curried dishes, not just one.

The employees are sincerely nice.  As you walk in, it's as if they've been expecting you.  And if the food alone doesn't bring you back--I mean, how could it not?--then their "thank you's" and "come again's" most assuredly will.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has the best chicken tikka masala around! I don't know if the food here is authentic or Americanized, but I see a lot of Indian families dining inside so that tells you the food is likely legit. I honestly don't think much of most of the other dishes I've tried (spinach saag paneer was especially disappointing) but the chicken tikka masala is so good that it cancels out any negatives!

I usually get the 2 item combo with the chicken tikka masala and goat curry. You don't see goat at most places like this and it's actually pretty decent. Depending on who's at the register, there can be differences in the portion. Feel free to ask them to generously pour the masala and curry over your rice. You pay 50 cents to upgrade the naan to a garlic naan which is reasonable I suppose. It's delicious dipped in the chicken tikka masala!

I do have to admit that the food can be a bit inconsistent on different days. Some days, the chicken tikka masala is spicy and not as creamy and other days it's very creamy and mild. Despite this, I still think this place deserves 5 stars!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Indian food. Now I will admit I'm not Indian and I'm not an expert on this cuisine. Most of my experience with Indian food has been at lunch buffets. 

I read about Curry Hut on YELP and wanted to try it.  It is kinda of a fast food type of Indian restaurant. Its packed into a mini mall off of Chapman, a couple blocks east of Raymond.  Parking sucks so we ended up parking on one of the side streets since every parking stall was taken.

We usually order the two item combo. You choose from one of ten choices, some are vegetarian, others with a protein like chicken or goat, all of the choices are outstanding. You also get rice and naan. If you want the garlic naan (always go for the garlic), it is 50 cents more. There is also a choice for a one item or three item combo. 

Today I ordered chicken masala and vegetable korma. It was terrific! My wife had aloo gobi and vegetable korma. It was so delicious and we were so hungry I neglected to take a picture until I had killed off most of my entree!

This place is always packed at lunch, very popular. A good sign are the number of South Asians that frequent the place but I honestly see people of all ages and backgrounds here. The food is always piping hot and tasty.

This is honestly one of my favorite places in Fullerton!

Five stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3.5


So it was one of those days where I had a certain hankering for something in particular.   I was on my way to Capri shoes picking up some shoes . I took the streets because there was no way I was taking the 91 from the 55. F that!  I went the wrong way and stumbled upon this shopping enter .  I saw the signage for fastish Indian food.  I had food in my fridge at home but curiosity got the best of me and I don't live on this side of town so I need to take advantage.

 I came in and took a look at the menu. Everything looked fresh behind the glass window. A guy in front of me wasn't ready and he said he was new to this place and I was like me too LOL. They actually let you taste test before you order a full serving. Which is cool for people who don't eat this kind of lovely food .I wanted a 3 item plate comes with naan and I upgraded to garlic naan for a few extra coins :p I picked palak paneer , veggie korma and chicken tikka masala. The service was nice and he made fresh garlic naan so I waited for about 5 minutes are so and I was on my merry way.

 I got home and I was HOOOOOOONNNNNNNNGGGGGRY. So I plated everything and started grubbing. The food is SUPER FRESH!  BUT some of the ingredients that should shine in each dish are not apparent. I wouldn't say bland but the key ingredient that makes each dish of what they are was missing. So they need to put a heavier hand , especially in the veggie korma. The chicken tikka was pretty good and the chicken was tender, even for leftovers reheated it was still tender. Their rice mixed with everything was addicting. I couldn't stop eating it and the garlic naan was so fresh!  After my meal, I was and still am anxious to come back. My instagram friend tells me I have to try the goat curry, it's his fav! 

  I was a happy camper overall, just season up a few things more and it will be perfect. I will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent food fast and great pricing.  The nan bread us so good, small but great place good. Chicken,goat and veggies<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Curry Hut is amazing!!!

For $5.99, you can get a 1 item combo, and it's more than enough. Huge portions. 

Every time I go, someone comments on how big the portions are: "They give you a LOT!"

I guess this is considered Indian fast food, but it definitely feels authentic, and the people behind the counter are very courteous. 

There's a good amount of seating, including outdoor seating. The TVs are always playing Bollywood music videos... they're very entertaining... so be prepared for good laughs HAHA 

All-in-all, my church has become a regular at this place and we'll definitely come back for our Sunday lunches !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The chicken tikka masala is to die for. The service is quick and they don't compromise on the quality. Great food and cheap price. I recommend the 2 item combo! Amazing food<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">HANDS DOWN THE BEST Indian take out I've ever had + friendly, welcoming staff. Their chicken tikka masala is so flavorful and doesn't feel as heavy as most others do. The veggie korma is so good too. I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like, I genuinely crave this place every day I don't know how they do it!
If you're trying to decide on an Indian spot and this one is a little further, the drive will be sooo worth it. Trust me!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Alright OC, you're starting to grow on me. 

There's this Indian restaurant my wife and I frequented often called Cafe Bombay (if you're ever in Atlanta), and we were craving Indian food, specifically chicken tikka masala and Japan. So after yelping around a bit, we landed here at Curry Hut after all the rave reviews. 

At first glance, it's not your typical Indian restaurant. It literally looks like a fast food joint... and inside looks like a fast food joint. But the smells and the sights are a whole world different. 

Served cafeteria style, your typical order can be 1, 2, or 3 items. I chose the 2-item plate with two servings of chicken tikka masala. My wife chose the tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala. Each plate comes with rice and naan. Upgrade your naan to garlic naan for only $.50, totally worth it. You can also order a la carte curry, which has either a 2-3 or 4-5 serving portion which we might do next time. 

Ok - enough, to the taste. The first thing I noticed was the deep rich spices and the creamy taste of tikka masala. But something was a little different. When we would get Indian before, every bite you take, your stomach would slowly get fuller and your eyelids get heavier = food coma. Indian food would always be followed by an Indian nap. 

But at Curry Hut, that didn't happen. The curry was flavorful yet surprisingly light. All the flavor without all the heaviness. Plus, the naan was off the hook. Fresh and ouffy, plus the buttery garlic topping. So perfect. 

I will admit... it didn't have the same kind of satisfaction as the one in Atlanta, but it was definitely delicious. Go check it out!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best Indian food I've had in Orange County, hands down! It's so authentic tasting. It seems to be family owned, perhaps. There are giant pots in the kitchen where the curry is being stirred. The garlic naan is MADE TO ORDER, with love. It's the best naan I've had.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was really craving Indian food for dinner but our usual place was closed so that's how we found ourselves at Curry Hut. Curry Hut is really hard to miss. It sort of looks like a circus tent with their bright colors and shape. Now, you have to note here that the food is served cafeteria style. All the food is already prepared and ready to go in steamer trays. The only thing that they cook to order I believe is the naan. I personally do not have a problem with food being already prepared because I'm a huge fan of Indian buffets and have had no real qualm with the quality or the taste. That changed for me here at Curry Hut. 

We both ordered the two item combo with garlic naan along with an order of vegetable samosas. Unfortunately, one bite into my meal, I knew that this wasn't what I would consider even close to authentic. Americanized Indian food is the best way to describe the curry here. It's so bland and watered down that I was just aching for some spice and heat. My favorite Indian dish by far is Veggie Korma and it was a huge disappointment. The vegetables were severely overcooked and the dish had no flavor. The Chicken Curry was a little better but it was so runny and lacked that richness that I associate with Indian food. It tasted watered down basically. The chicken was however moist. We had the same issue with their Chicken TIkka Masala which probably was the best curry out of the three we had. It tasted fine but was lacking depth. The Tandoori Chicken was also just okay. A tad dry but I always expect that in Tandoori Chicken. 

The best thing we ate from Curry Hut was by far their samosa. Spicy, full of herbs, and seasoned to perfection. I wish i had just gotten a few more of them and had my fill with their garlic naan which was cooked properly. For what it's worth, their prices are very reasonable and you will walk out with a decent amount of food. I would personally just pay a little more and have better tasting food. 2/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Curry Hut is quite the conspicuous place - the building is painted bright orange and green, and the inside follows suit. I enjoyed the tackiness, and paired with the exuberant music videos from Indian MTV and the delicious food, I quite enjoyed my experience here and would recommend it to anyone looking for some cheap Indian fast food.  

Boyfriend and I were both pretty hungry, so we got the three item combo for $8.99 to split. Turns out buying the two item combo would have sufficed...for BOTH of us! The servings are very generous, and the third item comes in a separate container, almost like they knew you wouldn't be able to finish it. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, and Goat Curry. The standout of the three was definitely the Chicken Tikka Masala- so much creamy flavor! It was not that spicy, so it's a pretty good introduction for anyone who hasn't tried much Indian food yet. The other two were alright, nothing bad, but not that memorable. Another favorite part of the meal was the NAAN. I partially judge Indian restaurants by how good their naan is, and this place passes with flying colors. So soft, warm, and perfectly dense enough to sop up the curry. I should have gotten garlic naan...and also my own meal so I could have had my own naan. 

I think this place is excellent in value and great in terms of taste. The people working there are really nice too! It's a hop and a skip from Fullerton College, so if you're taking classes there please patronize this business. I know where to go for Indian food in Fullerton!

Food: 4, Service: 4, Environment: 3, Price: 5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Indian food for a value?  I'm in.  This place was pretty darn good.  We got the goat and it was on the spicier side but jam packed with other flavors too.  Also ordered the chicken tikka masala and chicken paneer.  The chicken tikka was on the sweet side so not the greatest but still decent.  The chicken paneer was a new one for me and this exceeded my expectations.  So delicious.  We had a side of garlic naan and of course rice.  We ordered 1 plate with 3 items and this was enough to feed 2 hungry big eaters.  It's a little far from home but if ever in the area again I will definitely be dropping by.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Simply AMAZING Indian food. The restaurant is small, unassuming in a run down shopping center but don't let that fool you. The food is legit and delicious. We tried the vegetarian entrees- saag paneer, aloo gobi and vegetable korma and they were all fantastic. The naan and samosas are made to order and I can say this naan is one of my favorites. We just left and are planning on returning very soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here with my mom for lunch. Everything is laid out for you to see and choose what you want. Fast and easy which was good cuz I was haaaangry. We shared the goat curry, chicken Marsala and curry cauliflower and potatoes. Goat was bomb with just enough spice slopping up the naan with it yummy I also enjoyed the Marsala very tasty. Only thing I could of done without was the cauliflower. But I will be back for sure price is great along with the food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Huge portions and low prices on Indian curry! One order usually lasts two meals :D

My staple here is the spicy chicken curry and chicken tikka masala combo, which comes with rice and a large piece of naan. The spicy chicken curry is pretty spicy, while the tikka masala is creamy and sweet. Which is why they compliment each other perfectly! I've also tried the chicken spinach, which was good (and medium spicy, which I didn't expect).

The naan is super fluffy and soft, make sure you dip your naan into the curry.

Pro tips: Ask for extra sauce on top of your rice, prevents you from running out of curry. Also, beware of the spices and seeds when eating the chicken tikka masala. They don't fish them out and it tastes totally gross to bite into one of those seeds.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Inexpensive. That's about the only good thing about Curry Hut. The rice and naan were bland. The chicken tikka masala was sweet, it threw me off. All of it lacked flavor. Won't be coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is by far the best fast food Indian place I've ever been to... Most places have really bland food or the sauces are really watery.  For a fast and affordable Indian dining experience, this is the spot.  Garlic nan only takes about two minutes and everybody here is super friendly. I come about twice a week.  Try the chicken Tika masala and the mango chutney...awesome<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So good.  Nice employees.  Just all around great place.  I know you might think it's hard to mess up curry or naan, but trust me, it's not hard. I've had horrible ones.  This place is legit!  Thanks for the great service and food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is like a hole in the wall. It's awesome and quite inexpensive at all! Love love love the food and especially the garlic naan.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food, decent-ish service and dirty restroom.
It can be quite frustrating to make orders especially if you're a first timer.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very good! The employee allowed my friend and I to sample the different curries. I got the chicken tikka masala. It is a tiny bit spicy but not too bad, considering that I don't like spicy food. Prices are cheap and you get a lot which is nice. Will be back again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow, this place was amazing. One of the best Indian food places in the Fullerton/Brea area.

I went in around 4/5pm on a Sunday evening and as soon as I walked in with my friends, we were instantly greeted by a really nice lady. I got one entree, the Chicken Tikka Masala with regular naan. They also offer garlic naan as well. Great flavor on both of them. Prices are very good too, good for a quick meal in or to go as well.

The restaurant is very clean as well. Many tables and high chairs around the corner. Wide variety of drinks and they also have 2 TV screens usually playing Indian soaps on both ends of the little store.

I do recommend this place and I will definitely be coming back in the near future!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As the first Indian food place that I've ever been to, this place is the gold standard as far as I'm concerned. I love their tikka masala, chicken curry, and the garlic naan is on point. . . when you get it. The service is reasonably quick but, and your mileage may vary on this point depending on when you go, their naan production pipeline needs some work.

If you happen to go during a busy time, and you opt to eat there instead of take out, you may be waiting for a while for your bread. I've been once before and they needed to be reminded that we hadn't received our naan before it was brought out to us. 

Tonight, the place was reasonably busy with to go orders and I decided to eat there before class. I'd ordered (and paid for) the garlic naan option but i never got it. Mine was the sole "for here" order in a sea of to-gos, and those took priority it seems. I took my time eating hoping it'd arrive before I ran out of sauce but it never came. I just heard the gal working up front calling for more orders to go. I ended up leaving and not saying anything since they were so busy but i was admittedly a little disappointed.

That having been said, the food, when you get it, is on point especially for the price and speed at which it comes to you. Just wish they were better about the naan thing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">For me when it comes it Indian food it's either eat it at home or go to Pioneer st in Artesia which is basically little India, but I gave this spot a chance cause my buddy really wanted to try it. I had my doubts due to the pics on Yelp and It was a lot better than I expected. It's like a panda express style where the food is kept warm and you choose your proteins and rice. I ordered the chicken tikka masala, vey tasty with a bunch of chicken, also come with garlic naan, which kind of took a while but well worth it since it was made fresh. Also got a mango lassi can never go wrong with a bomb yogurt drink on a hot day. Overall, this spot was a lot better than I thought and I would come back for more of that chicken tikka.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time here - but surly not my last :) I don't have much experience eating Indian food, but what I ate here was definitely yummy! When I walked in and looked at the selections, I had a puzzled look on my face, but the server told me that I could sample whatever I wanted. She was very kind and helpful, which added to my overall experience. I'm vegetarian and not so big on spicy, so after trying a couple of options, I decided to go with their $7.99 2 item combo: Spinach with cheese and Veggy Korma, both arguably more delicious then the other, but I really enjoyed them together. It also came with rice and freshly baked naan bread.

To be honest, at fist glance the food doesn't look really appetizing, but it is! I recommend at least sampling each one before making a judgement call - you won't be disappointed. Ps: This is a tiny hole in the wall place, so don't be surprised if you have to wait a little for parking or getting your food, especially if you go during rush our. Enjoy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Authentic Indian. An amazing hole in the wall with great food and good value. I love it<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I Love Indian Food. This is Fast Food Indian, but is delicious.
The Service is fast and you cant beat the price.
The Naan is the slowest process but is worth the wait!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's my first time here and definitely WON'T be the last! 

The food is amazing and on top of that, the price is TOO GOOD.

Since my humble stomach can not handle the 2 items combo, so I went with the 1 item combo instead, so did my bf. 

I got the Spinach and Cheese and Garlic Naan. The curry is thick and pretty cheesy. 
Naan is EXTREMELY flavorful as if it took a long bath  in garlic before it is being served. It is also big and fluffy. 

My bf got the Chicken Tikka Masala, so I had a chance to try it out too. At the very first taste I was HEAD OVER HEELS. The curry is so creamy and so thick in flavor. All the spices make up a mild spicy in the curry. 

Prior to the main meal, I did a little tasting for yogurt something ( my memory is a little blurry). It was pretty good, but a bit spicy for my taste for a mid day meal. However, it will be the first thing I get when I return for the 2nd time. 

Btw, I was there on a Sat lunch...customers service was nice. The server gave us a generous portion. And despite the fact that most people didn't like the decorations, I really enjoyed it because it gives out a local vibe and makes me feel comfortable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fast, convenient tasty food at a reasonable price.

The meal would be far more enjoyable if the rice were prepared to be slightly softer.  That is my only taste complaint.

The parking situation is sometimes difficult.

Friendly and helpful people work here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been here at least ten times now, so I feel I have a good sense of what's up with Curry Hut.

Food is excellent, fresh and a great value... absolutely get the garlic naan! If you get a tandoori item, be aware it can take 20 minutes since they cook it to order! All the hot table items are fresh and so, so good. Spinach chicken and chicken tikka masala dishes are amazing.

People working there are very nice. One star docked only for the general grunge factor - but it doesn't affect my opinion of the food! I would eat here every other day if my waistline and wallet allowed for it.

If you are tired of waiting for Pita Hot, walk over to Curry Hut!

*Don't park in the 7-11 parking spots; they will tow you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Omg I wish I could live closer so I can come here everyday. My sister and I were in the area and needed to grab some lunch. I had a craving for some Indian and saw this place nearby. We both got the 2 item combo that came with naan. I forgot to mention to the lady that I wanted garlic for my naan. However the regular naan tastes great too, but I just preferred more flavor for my naan. We both got the tandoori chicken, chicken curry, and chicken tikka masala. It was delicious. The lady that took our order was friendly and language wasn't a problem because all you had to do was say the name and point at it. Loll. I had to use the restroom and the nice lady showed it to me. The restroom is located in the back where you have to pass the kitchen and it was clean and smelled nice. So that was a plus too!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very dirty food, and horrible customer service. Employee sneezed in her hand and didn't bother to wash her hands before continuing to serve food. In very surprised by the reviews given the very poor quality of the food and how dirty the place is. On top of it, the person helping me was very rude. Avoid this place. There are lots of other Indian restaurants with better food, better service, cleaner environment, and better prices. Tony, the owner clearly has no idea what his employees do when he's not around. AVOID AT ALL COST.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was good, very authentic; unfortunately, I had to stop eating it when I saw a bug on it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After you get past the somewhat rundown, shabby appearance of this place, you'll discover a great bargain in some very good Indian food. Maybe it's true you can find better Indian food around but finding generous, flavorful AND reasonably priced INDIAN food is a challenge. This is a labor intensive cuisine and I'm grateful to those who work so hard to share their culture through their food. I've only eaten there one time but I was very happy with the quality. I'm willing to drive the 25 min again to enjoy their food. But I've got to admit I felt like I had to turn a blind eye to their take on cleanliness. I've travelled a lot so I just pretended I was in another country and it was  no big deal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good, fast, tasty Indian food.

Plus, you can watch Bollywood videos while your food is being prepared.

</p></p><p itemprop="description">The most stellar Indian food in SoCal and beyond. I haven't had Indian this great since I left NYC. Their cuisine is from New Delhi. Hand crafted sauces. They take time to grind their own spices. They use a premium long grain basmati rce that is so fluffy, its nearly heavenly.  Their tandoori chicken has the most perfectly cooked onions, cooked but still w a great texture and bite. Everything was so good I have to become a regular in order to try their whole menu. So memeorable were the Yogurt curry, Paneer in Saag, and the Chicken Tikka Masala had such great flavors coaxed out of it.  Now the garlic bread was so outstandingly good:  Crunchy crispy texture, with airy chewy dough.  This place is two thumbs up way way up. So awesomely delicious. Service is fast, friendly and kind. U feel like u are being hosted at someone's house.  Portions are generous. Such a great value.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food, reasonably priced. Friendly service

</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's been so long since I went to Hut Curry
Lunches on Sunday are usually spent at Mickey-D's
"Daddy's choice for lunch!" said my wife lovely
So I directed her to drive to Hut Curry!

So I walked inside
Ordered the two-item plate
Around right bucks a value through and through

You're still my number one
I'm gonna have some eating fun
I'm gonna pour sauce on my rice
I'm gonna savor all the spice
And all the bites of naan
For value and Indian food fun
You're still my number one

The korma veggie it is a creamy delight
The chicken saag I savor every bite
The eggplant dish it is spiced just so right
Samosas huge, a heat punch in every bite

Two big pieces of naan come with every plate
Just a bit more cash for garlic naan

You're still my number one
I'm gonna have some eating fun
I'm gonna pour sauce on my rice
I'm gonna savor all the spice
And all the bites of naan
For value and Indian food fun
You're still my number one<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm glad I found this place.
I got the 2 items combo: tikka masala and spinach cheese.
The portion is huge for the price!
The only surprise is just I don't expect the spinach cheese to be spicy, but it's all good!
Definitely coming back!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great lunch deals!! Chicken Tikka marsala was great and the garlic Naan was even better. Door Dash delivers for a little more than what you would pay if you ordered directly but not by much. Food is always hot, fresh and delicious!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here a few times now and I've really enjoyed it.  It's really close to my work and eating here is quick and convenient.  Restaurant is just like Panda Express where all the food is ready to go in steamer trays.  You can get 1, 2, or 3 items and meals come with rice & naan bread.  There's an even amount of vegetarian and carnivore entrees to choose from.  

So far I've tried the chicken tikka masala, spinach, cauliflower/potato, and a chickpea dish.  Everything so far every good and has a nice bit of spicy kick to it.  The Naan they give you is a huge portion and you can get plain or garlic.  

If you're in the mood for some quick yet delicious Indian food check out Curry Hut!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I think this is going to be my go-to place for Indian curry when I'm craving it. Why you ask? Well they are a little hole in the wall type joint and their curry is already made so its basically instant. Plus their curry is served hot.

The downside is that their garlic naan (which is an additional $0.50 charge) although smells amazing, tastes pretty not special. 

I was a fan of the veggie curry and their chicken tikki masala. I'll be back for their pricing and speed of service :D<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yummy!!!! There wasn't a lot of bones in the curry goat.  The sauces for the chicken tika masala was so thick, just how I like it.  The naan was thick and fluffy.  Overall the flavors all popped.  This is very good "fast food."  I did not love the chicken samosa or the stuffed naan, but it wasn't terrible<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am a regular here and always enjoy the chicken tikka masala with potatoes and cauliflower and naan. This time around I called ahead to place my order, when I got  home I was really looking forward to my food. Unfortunately, when I started digging into my food I found a hair. I then opened my naan and found a smaller hair. I was so disappointed!! I called and let them know and the lady that works the front apologized, but I am super grossed out. Not sure I will be back anytime soon...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It was my first real Indian food in America!! Was so gooood! Thank to my boy friend brought me here~~~ I loved chieken tk masala most! So rich curry it was!! Lol<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You guys. I don't yelp. Like this is my second entry EVER. With that being said, if I could give this place 6 stars, it still wouldn't be enough! Fantastic! Between my boyfriend and myself we tastes pretty much all they had to offer for the combo plates and it was all perfectly prepared. The chicken in the Chicken Tikka (s/c) was so tender and moist. The Saag Paneer had so much flavor, I could have eaten three more helpings. 

I know it claims to be fast food, but don't be fooled, the quality at Curry Hut is top notch. Foods off the hook, definitely go!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent food. Excellent service. 

Just tried Curry Hut out last weekend. Really great food. We had the saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, and aloo gobi. Everything was very good. We were offered samples of the food too. 

We were a little worried when we arrived because we thought it was a fast food place but this is definitely a restaurant. Think more chipotle standard than McDonald's. 

We were very pleased with out experience and we left saying "we've found our Indian place." We'll definitely be returning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is awesome but service is horrid! Order a two item with Chicken Tikka Masala and the second serving is an entire scoop of sauce. Really pissed!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time at this place and to be honest, is really good. 
As soon as we enter, a smile was welcoming us, the person behind the counter gave us samples and all the food was delicious!!!

DELICIOUS FOOD+AFFORDABLE PRICE= PARADISE!!!
I definitely recommend this place with my eyes closed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wanted to try this Indian fast food restaurant for some time now and since I was hungry and in the area, I decided this was my chance to finally try Curry Hut even though my friend wasn't hungry at the same time, my stomach growls won again, haha!  The interior is brightly decorated in bright orange and green which matches their easy to read menu and friendly staff.  

Immediately upon stepping inside, there is a small buffet of hot food trays with helpful labels on the sneeze guard directly in front of you and nice aromas from the kitchen.  I checked out their selections and menu board and decided on the two item combo for $7.99.  It comes with rice, naan and raita (?), not sure what that is.  I selected the chicken tikka masala, the eggplant curry and garlic naan which costs a little bit more than the regular naan.  

After waiting a few minutes and watching the Bollywood station on TV, I remembered to order the mango lassi (flavored yogurt) which I found to be nice and creamy although I had to save half of it to thin out later with some unsweetened almond milk to lessen the sugar content... try it, it's still delicious and no problem, more for me to drink later.  

Everything was delicious... the fragrant rice, the mild and creamy chicken tikka masala with nice sized chunks of chicken, the soft eggplant curry was nicely flavored and the garlic naan was a little smokey flavored (with burnt edges) but nice and soft.  I'm not an expert on Indian food but I would recommend this place for a fast Indian food craving.  I'm not sure what their official government health score is.  Eat in or take out, vegetarian or not, you'll be a happy and full Yelper.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Found this place on Yelp, so SATISFIED! 3 item combo with chicken tikka masala, goat curry, veggie korma & a side of garlic naan, A+++! THIS PLACE IS SO AMAZING! Waited in line and met some nice regulars who recommended the items we got. If you like good authentic Indian food, this place is a must try! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Well I got the chits after eating. So did my brother.

Now to the food. It's just not that good. It's obviously made for American palate which means bland and flavorless but I guess that's why this place has good rating.  This place is where people go so they can claim they are a fan of Indian food even though most dishes barely qualifies as such.  It's like ordering california rolls and philly rolls and claiming that one is a fan of sushi but would never get nigiri or something.

Most of the dishes did not taste like the dish it was suppose to be. The tikka masala was bland and had very little tomato and cream flavor. It was very light and watered down. The korma was bland as well. The garlic naan had zero garlic flavor. Where was my raiti? 

I knew I should have ate at a sit down Indian restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't like Indian food generally. This place changed my mind. I've been here once or twice a week for the past 3 months. 

The flavors are explosive! The food is fresh. The owner is incredibly sweet and takes the time to try and get to know you and your name when you come in more than once. 

This is the BEST naan in the world. Soft, and thick, with just a slight crunch on the outside. It's home cooking available to the people. The pricing is reasonable. 

Dishes I've tried:

Chicken Tikki Masala 10/5 stars. Yes this is possible. It is just that GOOD.  Ask for extra sauce for dipping! 

Cauliflower and Potatoes 5/5 stars. Not too spicy. Wonderful flavor. Healthy.

Veggie Samosas  5/5 stars (They are HUGE and come with wonderfully sweet sauce)

Spinach and Cheese 4/5 stars. Solid and delicious. Just not something I order a lot.

Tandoori Chicken 3/5 stars (Other people would rate it a 5/5. For me its too spicy - but this is only PERSONAL PREFERENCE)

Mango Chutney 1/5 stars. It's too thick, too sweet, and comes ice cold. I don't recommend it.

The decor is not awesome (think hole in the wall)... but really who cares? If you're a foodie you'll get over it. If you like Bollywood music though, you'll be really happy here. 

I do recommend you NOT get a fountain drink and purchase a canned soda instead. The mix tends to be off - and with a canned soda you know what you're getting. They have a huge selection... never fear. 

Be advised they do not have public restrooms. They do have indoor and outdoor seating though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">YUUM! Great flavor and great price. Was able to feed three people for $23. Vegetarian friendly options. I have been obsessed with this place and it is all I crave. I've been coming here very frequently and have had no problems with their service. My favorite is the vegetable korma. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. LOVE THIS PLACE!!
I would give them 5 stars but they close early (i'm a night owl with late classes) and I wish they had delivery.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This small spot offers an assortment of traditional Indian food. They pack each plate with a mountain of rice and your choice of sides. They also offer tasty, warm bread. The prices fairly reasonable. This is one of my favorite curry spots and probably one of the best around.

Satisfy your curry cravings!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So good and the staff is super nice. Great service and good food. Just wish their online menu was the same as the restaurant menu.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">BEST NAAN EVERRRR! :) I always get the 2 item combo with veggie korma and spinach+cheese and I'm always very happy with my choice tehe 
Highly recommend! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My husband and I checked this place out last night and we were so happy with our meal and it's super reasonably priced...that was a big plus! We would go again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Five star salted lassi. I only get Lassi here. Food is good too but I like going to Punjabi tandoori for better curry and Naan. But their Lassi is the best. If you read this review, trust me, salted Lassi all the way.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Super good here ! I love it here by far my favorite place to eat ! It's clean and comfortable . The atmosphere is amazing and the customer service is super nice ! Will be back Forsure !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I got the 3 entree for $9.99 and Extra veggie curry for whopping $3.49 the price of this extra curry is ridiculous and the small container is half full. The goat curry which why I tried this place is good. But maybe it's just too early they didn't put a lot in my plate. Can't go back here<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I discovered very pleasant flavors in Indian cooking 

Great meat and vegetarian options. 

The Mango Lassi are deliciousness<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love supporting family run businesses, especially when their food is on point! This place is no exception! 

Curry hut is like cafeteria style panda express, except it is Indian and way more fresh. the plate combos come with naan and you can upgrade to garlic naan. My favorite is the Goat curry and the chicken tikka massala. Both are very rich and bold in flavor! Dont forget to ask the worker to put some extra sauce on the rice so you can have extra to dip with the naan! The workers are very kind and they seem happy to be serving you their food! Give this place a try next time you're thinking about pita hot or in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ok food, it cheap so its what you pay for. Ordered Lamb curry, tandoori chicken and chicken curry. Chicken Curry is totally passable. Lamb curry was good. the best was tandoori chicken. 
Service was fast. But parking is a mess in this complex. We had to park in street closeby and it was on a weekday!!
Not going to come here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Curry Hut is a cute little shack that serves fast food Indian food. You have a lot of options to choose from and the food is out front so you can see what you order. The garlic naan is my favorite. There's a front worker and two/three men who work in the back who cook. It's a small interior though so there isn't too much seating but good thing they have take out! You can also go to their website GoCurryHut.com to order online and just pick up! The food and the atmosphere is great! Also it's located right next to Fullerton College so great place if you're hungry and have a break in between classes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">this place is the BOMB. You get 3 items for $9.99 + rice +  naan.The portions are big too (probably can feed 2 people with a 3 item combo) and delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What do you do on a Sunday when your favorite fast Indian food place (in Anaheim) is closed? You come to Curry Hut, a very close second to "best fast food Indian within a 30 minute drive from Brad's house".

At first Curry Hut sort of turned me off, because it looks kind of dirty and grungy, but by my third visit I was past that elitist crap. The drive here, from west to east, is pretty interesting: when you're driving past the college, everything is so nice, but a couple blocks away from the college it's like someone flipped a switch on cleanliness. The first time I came to Curry Hut, the street was covered in papers and garbage, blowing around in the wind like I had somehow missed the apocalypse, or maybe it had only struck this area.

Curry Hut itself is pretty great. This is Panda-style Indian food, where what you want is sitting out in trays waiting to be spooned into a styrofoam box for you. The staples are usually here: chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, palak paneer, aloo gobi, veggie korma, and more. The only thing strangely missing is chicken makhani... But that's OK. I usually get chicken curry and aloo gobi ("potato and cauliflower"), they're always basically the same, always delicious. Sometimes they don't have aloo gobi, or they've just run out at least, and then I have no idea what to do because I don't like any of the other veggie dishes.

Is Curry Hut's food as good as my other favorite place? Not quite, but very close. Their naan is very, very close to perfection but falls just barely short of pure naan bliss, but again, that's alright. I'm just happy that there is a place for me to go on Sunday's when I am craving some quick Indian.

Like the Indian place out in LA by the college, by far the worst thing about Curry Hut is that it is sometimes filled with rude, obnoxiously loud college students who apparently can't talk to each other without shouting the entire time and laughing as if they're sharing a nitrous tank between them right in the restaurant. Worse than that, they're always shouting at each other about some stupid shit, always including the phrase "I can't believe she...! I can't believe he...!" Just believe it! It's all true, you're in college and everyone you know is just as horrible as you are, why are you even surprised? Eat your curry and shut the fuck up!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great Indian take out.  The portions have improved, now when you order a 3 item the 3rd item is put in separate container.  I love to order the 3 item with Chicken Tikka, Curry Chicken and Chicken Spinach, eat half and save the rest for another meal.  Garlic naan is great as well.  Its one of the best scoop and serve places I've been too.  Order for delivery through DoorDash.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually eat a few times at a restaurant before I write a review to check for consistency. This review would be an exception. 

I really loved this place and its 2 item special. I had their chicken curry, goat curry combo and ordered a garlic naan as well. 

Pros:
1) Very delicious gravy in both the curries. I did not taste much butter which is good for my cholesterol levels!!
2) Very generous portions of meat in the combo special. 
3) Naan had texture even after we got home. It was not flaky and hard like a disc that we sometimes encounter at Desi restaurants. 
4) Very friendly owner. 
5) Mrs absolutely loved the bright colors at the restaurant. Goes hand in hand with the flavor profile in their food, she said 

Cons:
1) A little too far from our house to drive here during Fullerton rush hour to get dinner to go.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very enjoyable, creamy chicken tikka with chunks of soft chicken this one was my favorite. The veggie korma was good but too salty and veggies were too over cooked, basmati rice was nice and buttery.
The fresh garlic naan was the best. Perfect amount of seasoning and garlic. Generous amount of naan about 2 big slabs.
Comfort food, yum.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nice lil spot with great curry bowls and combos. If you like Indian cuisine youll like this spot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely a great value for fast casual Indian food.

We came here on a Thursday night and it had a decent amount of people inside. From the street, it's hard to miss the restaurant as it's decked out in bright orange and green paint - you can literally see it from a block away. If you're looking for a landmark, it's directly across the street from the post office.

We each ordered a two item combo and were completely stuffed by the end of it. I ended up with with the chicken tikka masala and chicken curry. The masala was definitely my favorite of the two and was stoked that the guy at the register generously slopped some extra sauce on my rice upon my request. It came loaded with big pieces of chicken, mixed with fresh spices and a delightful cream sauce. Some of the people in front of me were ordering double orders of the tikka, and now I know why. 

As for the chicken curry, it was okay and not my favorite and I wouldn't order it again, but I was super happy with the garlic naan. I'm a big fan of the carb and was happy when they brought out two huge pieces each. Some places skimp on this small side and I always feel like a fatty for ordering more. Not here - I was out of food before I finished my bread. Good sign.

The guy helping was super friendly and accommodating. For being open only three months, it was cool to see how much the community embraced the place as a handful of people came in and he knew them by first name. Awesome, that means he already has regulars.

I'll be back when I'm in the area to satisfy my Indian craving!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Amazing service amazing food, fresh hot garlic naan. Hands down a win. I come here often and I'm in love<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I put in my order through Yelp about an hour before I wanted to pick up the food. My husband and I arrived and I noticed they forgot to give me my mango lassi. While my husband went back in to get the lassi I checked the rest of my order and realized that they totally forgot to give us a lot of our order. We ordered multiple orders of the chicken and veggie samosa and they only gave us one order. I had to send my husband back in to the restaurant and they didn't believe us! We had to show them the order and I guess they had to show the order also to the manager. We waited another 10-15 min for them to fix the order even though they said it would take a couple of minutes.

Taste wise my husband and mother in law did not like the chicken samosa at all. The veggie samosa was alright. We've had better in artesia. The mango lassi was too tart or yogurt tasting and not enough mango flavor. Haven't tried the actual food. Most likely won't. We will stick to Indian food in Artesia<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My two siblings and I got here a few seconds right before they opened. There were other people waiting in their cars to go in also lol. The food was delicious. Even having everything already prepared. So no need to wait a long time to get our food. It was very filling and satisfying. We ended having left overs. That we ate later that day. The food was nice and hot and so was the garlic naan. Perfectly paired with a mango lasi. Did I mention that there's vegetarian options and the options were yummy and tasty? Definitely recommend to anyone in the area. I'm definitely going back if I'm near by.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Never disappointed!

Authentic Indian food in quick, take out fashion. I typically go for the Tandoori Chicken and Saag Paneer, which comes with a generous helping of rice and naan. However, the garlic naan is MUCH better, so definitely invest the extra $ to upgrade.

I eat at this place at least once, if not twice per month. A must try!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was looking for a good place to grab some chicken Biryani and Roti, I found this joint through a Google search and headed down there.
I have to say it exceeded my expectations, I ordered my Biryani Medium and it was Hot enough! Perfect

I will definitely go back...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is good. 
The service is not friendly.
The place needs a deep cleaning.
I would get the food to go.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Better than fast food: I'm really glad I stopped by here on my way home from work as I had been CRAVING Indian food. I love my Thai curries... but when you try getting something else in lieu of what you want, it's unsatisfying (or so I've learned). This place is hard to miss with its bright colors on the outside--kind of in your face bright, but it does its job getting your attention I suppose.

I was super hesitant trying a fast food Indian place as the few "Indian" type foods that I've tried in the north OC area have been subpar. Plus it's hard finding a Curry Indian place as supposed to Indian/Mediterranean wraps and kabob places.  The prices were O.K.(for those pick item places) so for a 2 item plate and garlic naan (which I would highly suggest you upgrade to) you're around $10.00ish. Just looking at the choices though, you know you're getting something legit--whatever you choose. I got the Chicken Masala and the lamb dish (title unknown). I was surprisingly amazed at how delicious and flavorful my lunch was! It was one of those things where you're inhaling everything because it's so good (or maybe I was really hungry) but you need to portion control so you can enjoy it later as well. I'm not an Indian food expert, but I didn't feel I was eating "fast food". There was quite a bit of bones in the lamb dish, but I kind of expected that. Anyways, All in all, I will be back for sure and recommend for anyone who has the Indian food cravings.  Give it a few extra minutes for them to get the naan as I had to wait an extra 5 or so minutes in case you are in a rush.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I think the food is only OK.  The 4.5 stars on Yelp is way over rated.  I had all vegetarian and I thought it was bland.  I can taste the salt, I can feel the heat, but I can't seem to find the robust flavorful Indian food I normally enjoy in other places.   The customer service was nice and the food was plentiful and the price for the combos were just right for the college crowd.   Please increase the flavor by two notches.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've never tried Indian food before and I absolutely loved this first experience! I had no idea what to order, because all of it looked delicious. The staff were really helpful by letting me try some samples! 

I got the one item combo: chicken curry 
It was very flavorful with a kick of spicy. It also came with same garlic naan which is garlic pita bread. 

Everything was very delicious, but because I got the one item, there wasn't a lot of chicken. I had about five or six small pieces of chicken and a whole bed of rice. It also took a while to pay out, because their machine wasn't working properly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was not a fan. I felt that the vegetarian options were lacking diversity and taste. The naan was average and the mango lassi was good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">To be honest, I never cared for Indian food until I tried this place. Made me an instant fan. I crave it all the time now. I guess I never had good Indian food until I discovered Curry Hut. You must try the Chicken Tikka Masala! There is often a packed house but service is fast and friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place and I'm so glad I live close by. It's my go-to when I have a chance to go to lunch. Delicious and affordable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3.5 stars. This place is good and I come here at least once a month. Only thing is that they are super DUPER inconsistent with the portions. Sometimes its overflowing, other times it's meager. I wish it were the same every time. I think next time I go, if the portion is less than usual, I may voice that out or post a pic to show the discrepancy. 

After coming at least 20x times in the last 12 months, they don't recognize me or anything which is a bit frustrating since other take out places do. They seem to treat Indian people better, which I suppose I understand but come on, I'm a regular. 

I wish they had better packaging than the black divided styrofoam containers because 99% of the time, it leaks! Ugh! Hate when the bag is full of good sauce that could have been eaten and inside the container. 

Will still return because of the quality of the food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried this Indian restaurant tonight and WOW!!!! so very good. The place was empty when we arrived so I was unsure.., now it's packed. Super friendly staff, even the guests were nice. Better go to free up a table.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This was first experience with Indian Food! It was BOMB!!!! So GOOD! I didn't know what several of the dishes tasted like so the gal behind the counter offered me samples. Everyone was VERY friendly. Generous portions.  Can't wait to go back!!!! Especially enjoyed the garlic naan!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place looks funny from the outside, it is an Mexican restaurant that was turn into an Indian place. But I'm glad I went ahead and tried it the food is really good, great price and the garlic naum is awesome !!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you have not tried it, what are you waiting for. Good food, good service. The naan is fantastic. Go, now!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've tried many different Indian places through out LA and became more accustomed to the general level of authenticity now. This place offers excellent value for your money, and this factor alone, it would have to be a 4-star place. I've never had cheaper Indian food anywhere else.

The food quality and the service is great. But the food taste is too comforting, too bland, which I see it may work for the general public. I prefer Indian food to be more authentic, more punchy, a lot more usage of spice (higher food cost, of course), but less salt (the goat curry) and less sugar (the tikka masala). I may have too high of an expectation when I see 4.5 star place and people rave about how authentic the food tasted.

So my reason to give this place a 3-star is that comparing to my experience having tried great Indian and Nepali food in the past, this place is an ok place for a quick and friendly service, and I find nothing wrong with this business model. But what I'm looking for the most in restaurants are "good food". Also worth mentioning is that I also got a stomachache and some movements about one hour after. I always have this sensitive stomach which I rely on to determine of the food cleanliness when I dine out.

Value: 4 Stars
Decor: 2 Stars
Service: 4 Stars
Food taste: 2 Stars<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So, I don't usually leave reviews but I was so happy with their customer service that I felt inclined. 

It's only the second time I've been here but I really like the food! I really craved Indian food so I drove all the way up here from Garden Grove, since the other Indian places closer to my house either had really bad parking (Punjabi Tandoor) or had spotty reviews (Tandoori Garden). Plus, both other places would be too expensive, and this place is much cheaper. So, I went with what I knew and both me and my wallet are glad that I did. 

Got a three item combo with 2 parts Chicken Tikka Masala and 1 part Goat Curry. Rice and naan are included, and you can get garlic naan for an extra $0.50 (definitely should do it, but I saw some guy come in just for regular naan so that's probably good too. At least one person likes it.) The mango lassis are pretty good, but I've had better. Still, they are all delicious, and I'll definitely come back again sometime!

Now, usually that's not really enough for me to give a review, so I'll get to why I'm bothering in the first place:

The portions at this place are pretty good for what you pay, and being a small less-than-5-foot girl, I couldn't finish the three item combo. (But, I ordered extra because last time I took it home it was still really good, and I don't feel like going out for food tomorrow.) Anyway, I went through the garlic naan pretty fast because it's fantastic, so I went back asking for an order to go. I was running out of rice, so I was like "alright I can't eat this without rice because rice is life, so I'll just pay up." I couldn't find it on the menu so I didn't know how much it'd be, but I wasn't charged at all for the generous extra serving of plain rice they gave. I was so happy. An extra order of garlic naan was only $2.00, and while you usually have to wait, mine came pretty much instantly. I was super stoked. Also, I'm pretty sure she knocked off tax for me!! So nice. 

Maybe I'm hyping this place too much, but I've had a lot of Indian food before and this is as good as you can get for the price, and the customer service is fantastic. The lady behind the counter is super attentive and deserves all the praise she can get and all the praise you can give. 

Note: they don't really bus unless someone's made a mess, and the trash cans are hidden to the right after you walk in. Do yourself and everyone else a favor. Thanks. 

You should definitely try this place out if you both want Indian food and don't want to break the bank, as other places can get pretty pricy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Friend took me to Namastey India which was like a market/restaurant several years ago.  Never went back of course because it closed down.  Kind of stopped eating indian food in general but that same friend raved about how the same owner of Namastey India opened up a new restaurant called Curry Hut!  Finally went last night and WOW.

You walk in and open that door, you get a STRONG DELICIOUS WIFF of the food.  I've been craving indian food for a while so i was really happy.  I ordered 2 2-item combos with the Chicken Tk masala, chicken tandoori, Veggie Korma, and Chicken Curry with GARLIC NAAN.  WOW.  When they brought the garlic naan to our table, I scarfed that down.  It was so fluffy, chewy, and the flavors melted in my mouth.  I think it is even better than Punjabi Tandoor!!! Sorry Punjabi....but I think Curry Hut is on the verge of stealing my heart right now. 

Delicious.  Check this place out if you like Indian Food and don't mind the strong smell.  It is worth your money!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Never been to an Indian curry spot before and this was a great experience. They have plenty of choices and the portions are huge. Staff was super friendly. They get busy at lunch so get there early and bring some gum because the flavor is potent and will stay with you for the rest of the day!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service was really friendly.  First time here and the lady taking our order could tell we had never been here before.  But she was helpful. We wordered the chicken Tikki very with garlic nan, very delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is super tasty and freshly made. I love this place! Also people are super friendly!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The veggie korma and tikka chicken masala are so good. They also have the option of serving a la carte if you can't handle rice or naan.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I will give them 5 star because that's what they deserve! It's the BEST Indian food I've ever been to...reasonable price as well!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Visited this place few times now and never missed the spicy biriyani during the visits.. More meat, tasty food what else I need... 
Other items are not so spicy still good place to visit<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great value. Great tasting food. Polite and prompt service. Would recommend this place to anyone who likes good Indian food. It's not fancy, however the food makes up for it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is good, you get a good amount of quantity for what you pay. They make made to order naan. Overall will satisfy your weekly craving for indian food without burning a hole in ur pocket.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My wife and I had the Chicken Tikka the other day. Not bad.
The only drawback was a limited menu. 
We'll  try it again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent food and service.  We ordered chicken biryanis which was lovely!  Bread came really hot on the table.  Highly recommended!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you come here, you MUST try the salted lassi. I friggin love it and you will too. No matter what the cashier says to you warning that it is a unique taste or whatever, GET IT.

But the food is good. I like it. I would give it a three star because I know places better than this, but that salted lassi is phenomenal. That salted lassi is a five star lassi im telling you.

Good food, good service, simple easy menu, maybe the facility can be a little cleaner tho...but that LASSI.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been wanting to try curry hut for months since I drive past it every day on my way home. Finally, tonight, I decided to give it a shot.

I am a HUGE fan of Indian food. I have to say that it is definitely my favorite food, hands down! After reading so many positive reviews on Yelp, I was really excited to try Curry Hut. 4.5 stars and over 100 reviews. Has to be good! Right? Right?

Well...not so much for me. I had the two item combo with the chicken tikka masala, goat curry, garlic naan, and a side of vegetable pakoras.

First, the tikka masala had far too much yogurt or heavy cream (whichever was used) for my taste. The dairy taste overpowered the spices that make Indian food so great! The goat curry had good flavor; however, I seemed to have more bone than anything else. The vegetable pakoras tasted stale and old, like they had been frozen and then reheated in a microwave. Even the naan seemed to be reheated as it had the slightly older bread flavor. 

Now, I didn't expect super fresh from a quick service place; however, from the reviews, I expected better. 

Maybe I just caught them on a slow night? I'm not really sure with all of these great reviews. I have to say that I was very disappointed as I know other quick service spots I have been to were much better!

I might give it another try in the future; however, I don't have much faith that it will be any better. Sad times because I really wanted to like it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've gone here so many times now but haven't written a review! This place, hands down, THE BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER. And for how cheap it is, it's like my go to place now. It's become one of those places I have to not go to that much just so I don't get sick of it. The chicken tikka masala is the best I've ever had. Their vegetable korma is amazing as well. I've tried several types of naan and even the chicken naan was delicious. Also the people that work here are super friendly and nice. Like the bigger guy with a lot of hair is always super cool. Seriously check out this place if you haven't already. Also they make the naan fresh after you order it so it's nice and hot which I LOVE.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I loved it!! First time trying Indian food and satisfied. Customer service was great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my favorite place now. Me and my wife love indian food. This place is Bomb.com their food is really good. The lamb curry and chicken Tikka masla is good. The Naan bread with Garlic is another one of his speciality. All together this place for me is indian paradise with best food and service with a smile. The chubby chef  (I guess is the owner) takes care of smallest details when you order.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This time I got the veggie korma which has mushrooms and green beans. I planned on getting my normal 2 item tikka masala and goat but after tasting the veggie which looked appealing, I had to get the three item combo. If you love mushrooms and orgasmic curry, the veggie korma might be for you. It has a kick that's kind of spicy but not. Try it, you'll evolve as a person if you do I promise.!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My fave place for fast n cheap Indian food. They give huge portions and tastes so good<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">one of my favorite takeout places. I love the Chicken Tikka Masala and Saag Paneer (spinach cheese).  The chicken is always tender and moist and the servings are generous. definitely worth the money.  Just as good as my favorite Indian restaurant in West LA.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">People at my church used to laugh at me with pity when I suggested Indian food. Anything foreign and exotic like that was excommunicated. I was priest-ed. 

You know the drill and how Korean churches work. After service, you get hungry, want to hang out and what better way to have fellowship than to eat out? 

If you know be my now, I used to drive on Chapman daily going to CSUF. I know this street by heart. I even went to school on Fridays which is a college sin because no college student does that. I've witnessed many restaurants come and go. Even here was a Alberto's that was always empty and the owners decided to one day take off. I enjoyed the Alberto's because it had a salsa bar and I LOVE salsa bars. 

The interesting part is that I work close to here and honestly I've tired of EVERYTHING near this vicinity. 

Pita Hot - The local favorite, but the rice gets tiring after halfway through it. It's chewy and doesn't have the hard texture you find in middle eastern style rice. The wait and service are dull and not their strong suite.
Pieology - The place that sparked the do it your way pizza craze
Mexicazn - The Korean Mexican with no short ribs.
Flame Broiler - I hate the fact that their portions are small ever since they decided to use their own custom plate containers 
Yoshinoya - You can eat the beef bowl so many times
Chipotle - Even the mighty quesarito can get tiring
Boardwalk Burgers - Small portions :(
Sansai Grill - Not as good as I thought. The cabbage salad is fresh and has notes of sweet and a bit of savory as well as a nice crunch
Fantasy Cafe - They charge $0.50 for credit cards! And I've probably eaten the chicken teriyaki more than 20 times 
Mr. BBQ - They raised the lunch prices from $9.99 to $12.99 to $14.99!
L&L Hawaiian BBQ - Chicken katsu and Spam musubi? Not at this location. L&L provides smaller and smaller portions every year.
Thai Basil - Fancier smaller portioned Thai restaurant, but I got the Pa Nang Curry and wasn't impressed with the taste, quality and price. 
Little Caesars - $5 large pizzas can get tiring (custom order it with extra pizza sauce next time).
Papa Johns - Read the reviews. Not pleasant. 
Guppy's - Popcorn chicken meal lunch special for $7.99. That's like a dinner price! 
85C - I'm NOT going to spend $10 worth of pastries for lunch. 
Costco - You can rave about the hot dogs and pizza all you want, but no more for me. The hot dogs are an incredible value but I wish they had a like New York or Chicago style hot dog. California hot dogs and pizza are BORING and has no identity. 

My sophisticated pallet can take so much...

Fast food Indian? Think of yourself going to Panda Express and getting rice and 2 or 3 entrees. Have that mind set as you soon as you walk in. 

I'm used to eating the usual Indian buffet from 11am-3pm for $10. The bang out for the buck instead of paying $12-$15 a dish to dine in at dinner. 

That's a concept that you don't see everyday in Buena Park and Fullerton except for Namestey India. Let me get back to that.

The second week it opened, I had to try Curry Hut. I love when new restaurants open. I have to try it and I admit a bit of nostalgia kicked in. Walking in, I saw a familiar face (photographic memory kicking in) and he looked so familiar that I had to ask to get confirmation. He informed that he was the old owner of Namastey India! He sold it and decided to do what he loved to do which is cooking. 

Namastey India was a popular place in Buena Park next to a series of Korean businesses. It was also a market and keeping up both things was difficult. Now Namastey India is closed permanently because the new owner couldn't handle it. 

Every combo comes with rice, regular naan (garlic naan for an extra $0.50) and raita which has to be requested. 

1 entree $5.99 - For the health conscious 
2 entree $7.99 - Most popular
3 entree $8.99 - For the big guns

& a traditional a la carte menu..

Bread at an Italian restaurant, brisket at a Korean BBQ, carne asada at a taqueria, are the game changers. For Indian restaurants, the chicken tikka masala and the spinach paneers are the the make it and break its.

Chicken tikka masala - Creamy and full of flavor. How it should be. 

Spinach paneer - Imagine creamed spinach but with Indian spices and cubed cheese

Notable options:

Tandoori chicken - Another popular item. If you don't want a cream base to dip the naan, this is a good alt. 

Vegetable korma - Creamy taste of the chicken tikka masala, but creamier and with assorted vegetables instead of the chicken. 

Curried cauliflower 

I paid 8.75% tax the for my first visit. But the second was the 8%, which is the correct rate. 

Remember me mentioning my old church? Fast forward to now, Indian food is like grabbing Mexican food at King Taco. Exposure and personal growth in trying new flavors can go the distance. If you love Indian food or feeling a little bit adventurous like The Goonies, enter the gateway to a flavorful, robust and bold world.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really love the service here, the indian food is affordable and delicous. The restaurant  also offer rage of specialty  ice cream . Very colorful and  they also give you samples  of  thier food if you are not sure  what  to get.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been waiting forever for an Indian food restaurant to pop up near Cal State Fullerton, so when Curry Hut opened up I was quick to check it out. I absolutely love eating here. They have many options and if you are scared to try something new then ask for a sample and they will be glad to have you taste it. My favorites are the Chicken Tika Masala, Chicken and Spinach, and the Eggplant. Also everyone who works there is very nice. If you love Indian food then Curry Hut will not disappoint.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">garlic naan! so yummy in my belly ;).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not really that experienced with Indian food, but I've really enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala both times I've been here.  The garlic Naan was really good, as well!

The only thing that confuses me is that the online menu advertises "Curries A La Carte" but I'm not sure how to order them.  Is that an item you have to order in advance to take out?

Other than that, a nice, clean establishment, and the food is delivered really quickly!  I'll definitely be coming back a lot!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yum! This is my go-to spot whenever I have cravings. Everything they have to offer is delicious (especially the flavorful chicken tikka masala..oh and the garlic naan hehe). The only issue is they have too many options for an Indian-food-loving girl like me. BUT, if you ARE like me and terrible at making decisions, don't fret! The friendly workers let you try samples :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Curry Hut is definitely a hole-in-the-wall Indian fast food joint, but don't let that stop you because the prices are decent and the food is pretty good.  A 3 item combo will run you $8.99 + $0.50 for garlic naan, not bad considering it's enough food for 1.5 persons.  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken tandoori, and goat curry and all 3 were pretty solid.

My only gripe is that the tables are pretty dirty so opt to do takeout instead.

3.5 stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a great place for cheap and good Indian , food is very tasty, I recommend the goat curry and the garlic nan! Or how ever you spell that!  The flat bread.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Authentic Indian Food, butter chicken taste great and so does their garlic naan. Price is reasonable and so are portions. I've tried quite a few indian restaurants and I find myself coming here for the great taste. 

Minus one star because it can be inconsistent at times with taste or undercooked meat, but mostly good. They dont clean tables as often as I would like, I would go in and all the tables are dirty, so I find myself just buying to go more often now.

Bottom line, good place if you're looking for tasty indian food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">**edit**
I was just informed that the meat is boneless skinless chicken leg and forms the pink look when roasted in their clay oven. 

I apologize for the misunderstanding,
5 stars because I love curry hut :-)

</p></p><p itemprop="description">- Locale Destination - 
It's on E Chapman Ave and Raymond Ave in Fullerton. 

It's in a strip mall by the "Seven Eleven" and "Pita Hot". 
The place is small - a little amount of seating with TV for Indian music video (so hilirious - Indian people have a queer taste in dance and music video). The staff were all Indians. Decor is very casual and in orange and green. Nice service to offer me the tasting for curries. Plenty of parking. 

It's a quick service place - you pick whatever on the warmer. 



- Gluttony Expedition - 
Combo deals: 1 item $5.99, 2 items $7.99, and 3 items $8.99. Cheap. 10 different items. It comes with rice and naan. 

Chicken tikka masala: Creamy and rich in flavors and textures. Very mild. Great! 
Vegetable korma: Very flavorful and mild. I like it.  
Eggplant curry: Good, too! 

Garlic naan: It was pretty strong (garlic smell) and as big as my 13 inch laptop. $0.50 more than the regular one. 





- Conqueror's Deduction - 
Ok, I read some reviews complaining about the fake reviews by the owners (or its related people). I don't understand how the Yelpers (who found about it) kept checking the reviews BEFORE they even opened the restaurant... I'm a heavy Yelp user and never check the establishment like that - ever. Are they their competitions?? No life?? I don't know ;p 

Fake reviews by the owners and friends are nothing new on Yelp. But I don't think it's necessary that yelpers use up our precious review space for something not having to do with their experience at the establishment, though you can write whatever you want on your review. I write reviews all the time and my experience isn't always positive. If it were always positive, Yelp wouldn't need to exist. 
But I always write the facts and the reasons why I felt about stuff I mentioned - NEVER rant without the good reasons. It's not fair to the business. I always hope the customers could use my review for their next better selection of the restaurant and the business could use it to improve their business. It should be the positive outcome for both users. 

Anyway, I'm not the Yelper who cares about other Yelpers' opinions much ;p
I eat the foods and judge the place by myself. 

The foods were tasty unexpectedly. The curries were all mild and I like it because I'm a wuss when it comes to spiciness. I'm sure they can make it spicier if you asked. The portion might be a bit smaller size than usual, yet 3 item combo for $8.99 had a plenty of food for me. I like here ;)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've always thought that Fullerton needed a Indian food place so when Curry Hut opened up...you can just imagine my excitement!

The food is set up like Panda express or any takeout food place you know. There's 3 different choices--1 choice item 5.99, 2 choice item 7.99, or 3 choice item 9.99[?]. And they all come with rice and naan. If you want the garlic naan, they charge you $.50. But it's worth the upgrade if you're a fan of garlic naan. I know that I can't eat indian food without it. 

I chose the 2 choice option and opted for the chicken tikka masala and spinach with cheese. + garlic naan. 


The chicken tikka masala had to be second best one I've tried. It was sweeter and had more of the tomato flavor. The chicken wasn't dry or chewy, but really soft. The spinach with cheese was good, but I was never really a fan of that dish whenever I'd try it so I don't really know if it was spectacular or not. And the naan is thinner than other places that I've been to but still pretty good. 

I would say the most noteworthy thing I ate from here was the chicken tikka masala. When my cravings kick in again, I'll definitely be going here since the location is in the middle of everything. 

Would I call it the best indian food place? Probably not.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Woo!! I'm so happy to have found a good Indian take out place near me.

I came here for the first time with a vegetarian friend, and we each ordered a 3 item combo (about $10 per combo). I got the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Spinach Cheese, and the Veggie Korma. My friend also ordered the Spinach Cheese and Veggie Korma, and for her third item she got the Aloo Gobi (potato/cauliflower). It turns out, two pieces of DELICIOUS freshly cooked naan bread come with each combo... so we had a total of 4 sizable pieces of naan. We soon realized that we had ordered WAY too much food, but it was all so good!

The Chicken Tikka Masala was definitely on the sweeter side, but I still really enjoyed it. The chicken was very tender, and the sauce was perfect for dipping the naan afterwards.

Korma is one of my favorite sauces, and theirs was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but tasty nonetheless. I would prefer it with chicken myself, or at least a veggie version without green beans, but that's just me.

I quite liked their Spinach Cheese. The dish itself isn't for everyone, but I like it (and don't normally like cooked spinach), and enjoyed theirs. The cheese pieces could be a bit smaller for ease of eating, but nothing a fork/knife can't handle.

The Aloo Gobi was very, very good! I regretted not getting it haha, but then again, I really enjoyed my 3 items and they don't have a 4 item combo (only 1, 2, or 3). xP

And that was the first time I went.

The second time I went (less than a week later...), I took my mom and we got a 3 item combo and a 2 item combo to share. I don't know why I didn't learn the first time that a single 3 item combo is plenty enough for two people, but anyway. This time we got 5 completely different dishes: Chicken Tikka Masala, Aloo Gobi, Veggie Korma, Spinach Cheese, and a Chicken Curry. So to add to the above dish reviews...

The Chicken Curry was also very good! Tender chicken, good spices/flavor. My mom preferred this dish to the Chicken Tikka Masala.

Everything else was just as good as I remembered. So, points for consistency!

They also have fried appetizers (one day I would like to try their samosas and/or pakoras), garlic naan (for 50 cents extra), mango lassi drinks (and other lassi drinks), and other items on their menu. And for those who like goat and tandoori chicken, they have those dishes pre-made and ready to be put into a combo as well.

I'm usually an Indian buffet kind of girl because I LOVE all the variety, but I like having this hole-in-the-wall take out option for a quick lunch or dinner. Plus, their naan is some of the best I've ever had. I need to bring a large group of people so we can share a 3 item combo, try their samosas/pakoras, and get their mango lassi drinks. Because without a group of people to share with, it's just way too much food. Which, for $10, really isn't a bad thing.

Finally, it's a hole-in-the-wall establishment, but there IS seating inside. They also have a TV playing fantastic Bollywood music videos... which are a lot raunchier than the ones I remember from the 90s!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Search for a restaurant on yelp and came across this indian restaurant and decided to give it a try. This restaurant definitely reminded me of a small indian restaurant that i used to go to back in college. 

So, i arrived and ordered 1 item combo with chicken tikka masala and it comes with naan and rice. Chicken tikka masala was great and i believe they grilled the chicken first before the it swims in tikka masala sauce because there is a smoky taste with the chicken. The naan was a bit thicker than i used to but it still good nonetheless. Definitelly recommended and i will comeback soon<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been coming here for a few months now and I very enjoy the food. I highly recommend the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was brought here by a classmate earlier this year and I wished I knew about this place sooner. Every time I come in here, the service is attentive and they always offer a sample. I always order chicken tikka masala since I don't like plates that are too spicy. I like the portions that they give. Also it's not expensive.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This has been a wonderful addition to Fullerton! The food is fresh and flavorful and it seems to be cooked with love, it's like home cooking, when spices or tastes may vary some, and it is always good. This is another place that makes it difficult to choose dishes, because I love them all, but the vegetable Korma is one of may favorites tastes. Nan made to order, friendly people working there, its as though they treat you as a guest in their home. Prices are reasonable and portions are good sized. Better Indian food than I have had at most area restaurants.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just ate this place and this place is so awesome!  The lady at the counter was really friendly.  I had the Goat Curry, Chicken Tikka Masala and the plain naan.
The food was so rich in taste, and they don't chimp on the meat!  Naan was freshly cooked on order, also super good!  Will definitely come back to this place.  
Looks like a fast food restaurant and its also called fast food but the food is beyond that!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! Fast Indian food is like unheard of and this place rocks it. I'm super picky and I wasn't let down!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been keeping my eye on this place since they opened, and waiting for a good history of reviews to build up. I finally went in today to get lunch for my co-workers and I. We all ordered the one item chicken tikka masala, and I got a side order of the garlic naan. I took it back to work, unpacked the food, and found they had made a mistake! We had two tikka masalas, and one vegetable curry. While I was initially bummed, it turned out to be a happy mistake...the vegetable curry was delicious, and not something I ever would have ordered. The tikka masala was wonderful, and the chicken super tender. The portions are a great value for the low price, and the garlic naan was unbelievably good! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the order error. 

I will definitely be back to try again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Affordable, fresh garlic naan! The Tikka masala chicken is the best. Great flavors and spices. The combo plates are the best choice over their sandwich wraps (not that impressive). 

Casual, quick (except for the time it takes for the fresh naan but tooootally worth it) and pretty nice service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Price is cheap. U get what u pay for. Mutton curry was good here. Rice will be always half cooked. Cleanliness medium. Can improve a lot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lady on counter is really friendly, she guide us really well

Food was awesome . I tried butter chicken, chicken curry with garlic naan , test was awesome.

I will definitely come again and also recommend to others.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We got here a little before they were closing and they were more than happy to serve us, unlike some other places. Their goat curry was so good! We get everything for take out and their packaging was great! Definitely going back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has AMAZING food at reasonable prices. By far the best curry I've had in Orange County. I recently brought my father here, who used to live in India, and he was VERY skeptical of my ravings about the food here.  And when he saw the place (it is a small place, and painted neon green and orange - very bollywood) he was even more skeptical.  But after trying it, he's as obsessed as I am! 

Truly a diamond in the rough. Try the veggie pakoras and the samosas, and for a real treat get the mango lassi tea.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here many times and the owner is awesome.! Holla Tony. 

But since the girl started serving here, she always gives you less quantity than the owner used to give. You always have to ask her extra which is kinda embarrassing, but hey make your money worth it. Their service is kind a like panda express and a person is always more than full with the 2 item combo.

Good dishes are veg korma, chick en tikka ( its less spicy) , lamb curry which is amazing. Never had other entrees here. Their only entr√©e option is very expensive. 

I will recommend this place for the combo items and the mango lassi.

Overall good<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is possibly the best indian food in Orange County at some of the most reasonable prices. My family and I eat here all the time. The food is delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is always fresh and vegetarian friendly. Staff is always nice and the Bollywood videos are cool.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is great for a quick Indian food fix! I really enjoyed their tikka masala with rice & nana. Very well prepared and affordable!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been to this place once so far but will definitely come again.  We ordered 2 item combo with chicken and spinach curry, chicken tikka, and veggie samosa, naan, and mango lassi.  Everything was really good, except we felt that samosa was too overwhelming with the flavors of the spices for us to enjoy them. They give you a lot in your order. I ate my combo meal for dinner and lunch the next day and I was stuffed both times.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is so good for a "fast food" Indian place.. I tried the egg plant dish which had s<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food. Great service. Run down building. 
Had the Tikka Masala and Tandoori Chicken with Garlic Basmati. The food was hot and tasty and the naan bread came almost as soon as we sat down. The service was attentive and friendly. 
Where it all falls apart is in the building. It's run down with graffiti scratched into the mirrors in the walls. Ceiling tiles are displaced and dusty/dirty and the trash cans and tables are both covered in food and whatnot. All in all it seems like they could probably stand to spend more time cleaning. But that in no way detracts from the great food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just went there in the rain to order some chicken Biriyani for the first time. The woman at the desk helping was acting she can't speak at all fist I thought she is dumb then I thought it is her English. The when the food arrived, she places one of the packages right front of me I wasn't sure I opened to check what inside she gave me this startled look as if I did something terrible. I guess I even felt I did something wrong I almost apologized what the hell I paid $30 for 2 Biriyani a lot more we pay at Ashoka or Amaya and I could've check what I got. Whoever this woman is so rude and unprofessional moreover the food taste so bad. Never go back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Probably the best Indian food ive had in a long time! The chicken tikka is great and you have to try the garlic naan. Will definitely be back again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I havent even finished my food but i had to leave a review!! Food is incredible!! I cant tell you what i got because i asked the girl at the front to give me her two faves and she didnt dissapoint! Great food, fast and very friendly service, super cute color scheme, and they had awesome indian music videos on the tv!! Love it!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">From the outside, it kinda looks like a garish McDonald's. Don't let that fool you, though. This place offers delicious Indian fast food at a good price. My go-to here is the chicken tikka masala and the chicken curry 2 entree combo with some garlic naan. Both dishes are very flavorful with some tender chunks of chicken, and there's enough food to last you two meals (or stuff you for one meal if you're a fatty like me). The naan can sometimes come out a little too burnt, but you can just eat around the black parts if it gets too bad. You also get two per order, so maybe you'll have better luck with the second one. 

I'm no expert on Indian food, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. That being said, this place is great to get a quick fix of Indian food, especially if you don't feel like waiting 45 minutes for the nearby Pita Hot. Be careful if you get it to-go though, as all that saucy goodness WILL leak out all over the bag.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst food! Ordered it from door dash and wasted the whole food. Paneer was not fresh and was uncooked.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love indian food!!!!! It was actually only my 2nd time eating it but I love the chicken tikka curry + garlic naan bread ~~~~~~ That's what I got here and I thought it was yummy but it is indeed heavy.. At first, I thought the portion was too small and then later, I couldn't even finish it. My friend said the curry was too creamy and sweet (probably because of the coconut milk?) It was good to me though, and it's decently priced. My friend also got the vegetable samosa but it wasn't that appetizing..... I don't recommend it.
Service was good! They offer samples so woOoOOOO<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best saag and chicken curry in town. Their garlic naan is yum too. I know the owner (Tony/ Ashish) since they owned Namastey at Orangethorpe blvd. Great guy. The food is always fresh and reasonably priced. Thanks Tony for great food and service!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tasty. Cheap. Service was great :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food here is yummy and the price is right but the place can use a little bit of Mr. Clean. It's a bit grungy and I fear what the kitchen may look like if they don't keep the dining area clean.
I really enjoyed the food but I hesitate due to the lack of cleanliness. 

Clean your place Curry Hut!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fast, friendly, and affordable. Plus, India TV, Bollywood, cricket, or classic Music videos playing is fun. The shared parking lot can be a pain, but t doesn't stop me! Eat in or take out. Everything but the naan is gluten free... and the naan smells heavenly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Dropped by before picking the kids up from school. Ordered the Chicken Tika Masala. The food was excellent the service quick and I enjoyed the casual atmosphere. Will make this a regular stop.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was pretty good but not as good as punjabi tandoori in anaheim...portions were pretty small in my opinion but overall quick and convenient and satisfying<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious Indian food for a very inexpensive price.  One item with naan and rice came out to be $5.99 + tax and was enough food for two meals.  The naan bread was huge. Also they sell 16oz/32oz containers for a family meal.  Cashier was friendly and helpful.  Will be returning in the near future!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is THE BOMB!
Everything I have tried is quite tasty. Prices are reasonable, you can get in and get out quickly. 
I love me some Curry Hut!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Curry Hut catered for my mom's 60th birthday recently and I couldn't have been more pleased. It was our first time trying their food...our guests loved it! Additionally, the service was great. They were helpful in helping me to finalize a menu, they were professional in the manner in which they delivered the food...at the end of the night, my husband said, we could have had them cater our wedding! Great food, great service, great team!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Curry Hut is a short drive away from the always-busy shopping/restaurant area of Chapman and State College in Fullerton. You can eat in peace without having to listen to a conversation about last night's kegger. 

The food is simply delicious. I recently gave up meat but I don't really miss it because Curry Hut has great vegetarian options (veggie korma, eggplant, lentils, etc.). Flavorful and filling. The naan is hot and fresh (sometimes I splurge and get the garlic naan). 

Come here if you like great Indian food at a fair price.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A lot smaller than I thought it was gonna be but I really liked it. Food came quick and was delicious. I had been craving indian food and it did the job<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food here is AMAZING! The chicken masala was so tasty and perfectly seasoned (I dipped my freshly made, just out of the oven naan in it too). I also ordered the potatoes and cauliflower dish which was delicious and lastly, my favorite: veggie samosas. Yumm! I will definitely go back again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's good Indian food with combo options available one good thing about this place is its fresh and adorable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After my second visit, I must caution potential customers to not order online. I did today and told them I'd pick my order up at 5:45pm. I arrived at 5:45, took it to meet family nearby for dinner and the food was cold! Took the order back and was given a lame excuse that resembled "you ordered it too early." After a little hesitation on their part, they refilled my order and it was very good. The "lesson learned" from this experience is to just show up and order to go. Do not order online.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">5 stars would be if there was free bread.  cause they charge you more for garlic.  but they got some tasty vegan selections also, it should be 7.50 but its 9.17  oh well not too big a difference.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time here after looking for curry on Yelp and found this place. The taste, smell and the feeling after it was inside my belly was amazing! Food is great! I'd recommend it to everyone looking for some Indian food. I had the chicken curry and potato and broccoli with the garlic bread. I was in food heaven. A++<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious and a great price!! Like other reviews mentioned, the chicken tikka masala and veggie korma are amazing. Nice clean place with a very pleasant staff. The girl who took my order had a big smile and couldn't have been nicer. I will definitely be back. Thanks!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried it out because it was recommended to me by a customer of mine. Apparently the owner opened the restaurant with the recipes he used at home. It did not disappoint! It was my first time trying out Indian food and I enjoyed the experience. The meat was delicious and I enjoyed the garlic naan. My friend also came with me and he's big on food. He even said that it was delicious and he would come back. I'm glad I tried it out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Found out this use to be my favorite to go Indian place in Buena Park. Love the Tika marsala and the eggplant. The chicken samosas are bomb, especially with both kinds of chutney. Also, really enjoy the garlic naan. There's a female that works there, that can be really stingy with the rice and items. After dealing with her a few times, I'm debating on returning again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the best Indian food I've had in California and I've tried so many. The price is excellent and the dish includes your pick plus rice and either garlic or plain naan. Excellent Motor Gobi, Excellent Chicken Tikka Masala. I haven't tried the Goat Curry yet but I'm working up to it. Friendly staff, very fast, and easy parking. The hidden gem of Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So far this is the closest Indian food to what we have over the pond in the UK. All other Indian places serve 1 or 2 star food at most. This place is pretty good.had the goat curry with rice and nan bread. Very nice.. would have been 5 stars but there were little bones in the food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My boyfriend and I went here for a late lunch and took the food home. The food was delicious and had great flavor. We just wished the menu had a few more items on it...like dosas, parathas, or uttapam. 

Overall, we would come back. The service was great and the food was delicious<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've never had Indian food before. So I had no idea what to even get. The lady at the counter was great and she let me try samples and explained to me each of their items. OMG this place is so good. I love it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Curry Hut is a hidden gem! I found out about this place just by driving by it because the bright green and orange caught my eye while driving down chapman. 

When walking into this restaurant for the first time, I instantly got the vibe that this place is authentic. The T.V. playing indian music videos and the strong smell of curry reenforced the idea that I came to the right place. I asked the worker what she recommended since it was my first time at Curry Hut and she offered to give me some samples of the items, mostly curry. I enjoyed the chicken curry the most but the fact they had goat curry made me happy. I ordered the chicken curry and goat curry with garlic naan. As soon as I ordered, the worker called back that I ordered garlic naan. Anytime anything is called back to the kitchen usually means it has to be made fresh, which means its a really good sign of things to come. I added a drink with my two item combo and it came out to around $10-$11. I'm thinking okay, this place is a little steep with the pricing but you get way more than what you paid for. The portions of food was huge! The naan eventually came after we sat and it smelled so good. They gave me two huge pieces of naan, about the size of a paper plate. I was full about halfway through my meal and I realized that the 2 item combo with naan was more than enough food for myself.. but of course I still finished it :)

Overall, my experience with this place was positive. I will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu especially their dessert menu. The Gulab Jamun sounds amazing and the indian style tea/coffee is what I'll be ordering next time.

TLDR;
Authentic indian food with fresh naan makes this a quality place! I recommended to everyone thinking about trying Curry Hut.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place was not at all what I thought it would be although I read a lot of reviews and should have pieced together the information better. Basically when you enter, there will be a menu a la fast food joints and then a buffet of maybe 8-10 different dishes at the counter where you order your food. When you order (I ordered the 3 item combo), the person behind the counter will pull out a styrofoam container and pile on some rice and then rather messily add on the things you've asked for. I'd say that this is definitely not for people who have an aversion to their foods touching. Then, you fetch your own silverware (plastic) and find a seat.

I was really craving Indian food, so this satisfied the craving; however, I really disliked the presentation of food and knowing that the plastic cutlery and container were going in the trash (because I was dining in).

3 item combo: $8.99
Upgrade to garlic naan: $0.50
Vegetable Samosa: $2.49
Mango Lassi: $2.99<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I highly recommend Curry Hut. I always get the chicken spinach and goat curry with garlic naan! Delish.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great, fast Indian food. I got the 3 item combo (Tandori chicken, chicken masala and chicken curry). I upgrade my naan to garlic Naam for $.50. 

It's clean, fast and very inexpensive. I'm coming back for more!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I missed Tony!!!

I was a fan of a place called Namastey India for the last couple of years.  It was a lil Indian Grocery store with a variety of Indian fare lined up in the rear.  They were in an obscure lil strip mall off the beaten track of Buena Park (That means it's part of the track where there are less beatings... I guess... Buena Park is kinda ghetto).  Well, I discovered this place through Yelp & would frequently invite friends & church gatherings (EXODUS3!!!) to come & eat.  Everyone I brought to this place loved Namastey!  Tony was the owner of this fine establishment.  Nicest guy!  Hooks you up!  Gets to know his customers.  Stayed open late when we brought groups.  Overall just a great guy!   

Well, I got busy & didn't go to Namastey for a month or so, but to my chagrin I found out that Tony sold the place.  And of course when I went to Namastey, they changed everything, the food wasn't the same, and that store closed down soon after.  

Now, four months ago I got this random message on Yelp.  Someone named Ashish invited me to visit the Curry Hut.  I was like, "Who's Ashish?  Sheesh!"  So, I disregarded the message.  

Fast forwarding four months into the future, the Arnold that loves Indian food had some this past Sunday!  Guess what... fat boy third person Arnold wanted Indian food again today.  After a long day of work, I drove through a bunch of traffic & decided to finally check out  Curry Hut.  I drive up to a loud orange & green designed Indian fast food restaurant.  I walk in &... SERENDIPITY... I see Tony behind the register.  I was like... "TONNNYYYY!!!!"

Now, Tony started the business 4 months ago.  He told me that Namastey was a difficult location, but this location has been bumpin!  He mentioned that he messaged me on Yelp.  I guess Ashish is his real name, but he goes by Tony (That's Grrrreeat!).  Seriously, I'm so happy for him.  Great business!  Great location!  Same great food!  Same great Tony!  I suggest y'all get your Indian food on!  I'm definitely gonna! 

NOTE: If you live in Fullerton, the closest Indian food is probably Cerritos.  It's in a great location on Chapman... not too far from DTF & CSUF.  So, if you're DTF (Down To Foodie)... then let's go!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Loved this place.  We both got the chicken wrap and it was so flavorful and filling.  Although the interior is some what uneventful, the food and selection looks amazing.  Give this place a try....if you like Indian food, I think you will really like it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here earlier today to get lunch for me and two other people. The location was easy to find and in the same plaza as Pita Hot. Their restaurant looked fairly clean and well organized. 

I got (3) one entree combos for $5.99 each and upgraded my garlic naan for $.50 cents additional. Your combo comes with rice, one entree, naan, and raita (never received it). The portion of rice was great, but I wanted more curry! She was pretty stingy with the sauce.. maybe I should've asked for more? I ha the chicken tikka masala and it was ok, but I still say nothing beats Little India Grill's food in Artesia. The chicken curry is where the disappointment rushes in. Wow, watery chicken curry? It was so bland and tasted like spicy water that we had to throw it away :( what a waste. As for the garlic naan, it was too thick for my liking.. I usually like the thinner, soft, but crunchy naan. Their naan was a bit burnt around the edges and too soft in the center. 

All in all, I liked this place and will be back.. but please don't forget to add salt or whatever it is that goes into your chicken curry! And some more sauce would be nice in your entrees~<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I needed a tray of samosas for a dinner party and I called around and these guys were the best pricing. Everyone at the party loved the samosas and the sauces that came with it. I've been coming here on and off for a while and love this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay, this review is long overdue. Curry Hut is my number one favorite lunch spot when I'm craving something out of the norm. I always get the Chicken Tikka/Chicken Curry with Naan. This place is always fresh no matter what time you go which is hard to find in a "Fast Food" set-up. I enjoy their food so much I have ordered catering for my office's lunch. Almost everyone liked it, and if you get catered lunches you know that's a big deal to have the majority of the office enjoy what you've ordered. I the only thing I don't like is if you do take the food togo you will get the sauces EVERYWHERE. They do there best to pack everything in plastic bags but just be careful on the turns. I always transfer mine to a paper plate to stay from smelling like Indian food for the rest of the day. All in all I love this place, man I want some Curry Hut now :).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Curry hut has a great menu to offer but the taste is just as bad as good as it looks. The place is small but it has a good ambiance and North Indian touch. The quality of food is not good, could taste soda in the food and they do not offer any options of whole wheat roti/bread. It is not too pricey but just not worth it for the quality and taste offered.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We were driving around looking for a fast bite and happened to pass this place. We decided "Hey, what the heck?" and stopped in. This place offered everything we were looking for and we ended up really liking it! We both tried combos from the buffet. The food was hot, tasty, and came with basmati rice and homemade naan. We both upgraded to the garlic naan - worth it!

As it is a fast food joint, don't expect a fine dining experience. But if you're looking for good food quick with great service, this is the spot for you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">SO good. I've eaten a lot of Indian food and this place is perhaps the best I've ever had (even better than the fancier places I've been). The food is SO flavorful and delicious that I went one night with my fianc√©e and came back the next day with some friends. 

And the prices!! $10 for a three entree plate with rice and naan?! With the food being so dense, I couldn't even finish half of the $10 plate and I have a big appetite. 

When I drive to my family in the high desert at some point I will be bringing them some entr√©es. I know for a fact they will be jealous I live near this gem.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We love this place! We always get great customer service and everything we've tried has tasted great! I highly recommend their chicken tikka masala and chicken tandoori. Also their veggie somosas are and mint chutney wonderful. Thank you for the great food and service, we will be back for our weekly fix<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We love this place. The staff is very friendly, the food is amazing, and the price is reasonable. Highly recommended for anyone looking to take home some delicious indian food. TIP: The Chicken Tikka Masala is truly amazing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Modest restaurant with quality food, cooked from the heart. Good portions. Kind owner. Garlic Naan and Chicken Tikki Masala were exceptional.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yas yas yaaaaassss. Indian food at its simplest and finest, Curry Hut knows what they're doing. Anyone who needs a quick and decadent fix on Indian food MUST come here.

Once we walked in, we were quickly greeted by the nice cashier and frontwoman. She was very patient with us and took our orders with a smile. I ordered the 2 item combo deal of Goat Curry and Chicken Curry with Garlic Naan and a drink of Mango Lassi. Oh my goodness, it was all so delicious and freshly prepared. So many spices and flavors were running on my tongue a mile a minute, and I ate nonstop. The Goat Curry melts in your mouth with a slight spice and the Chicken Curry was filling and flavorful. The Garlic Naan was freakin' delicious, as I expect all Naan breads to be. The owner came by to personally deliver my yummy Mango Lassi and was very tentative.

Everything was about $12 and well-worth the meal. The decor was colorful and the seating areas were clean and available. No public restrooms, but they tell you where you must go if you ask to do your business if you're down for a little journey to the bathroom.

I am definitely coming here more often. So damn good!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time trying this place tonight, pretty damn good.

Tony, the guy at front is really friendly and helpful.

Food was delicious, wish I had ordered more.  The chicken curry is actually spicy which is rare these days.  1 star off for portion size being a little less than favorable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Garlic naan, goat curry and chicken curry. So filling! It's enough food for 2 meals. Perfectly spiced and authentic. Must try!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's fast food for sure. They give big portions but I wouldn't come here again for Indian food. The naan gave it the extra 3rd star but the food wasn't that tasty. The back room was dirty and so was the bathroom. I wouldn't come again<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered Chicken tikka masala and Goat curry.  Both were delicious but special mention of their Chicken tikka masala.  Their garlic naan was decent but need to add $.50 on top (they didn't mention that when they ask me if I would like regular naan or garlic naac).  I would be more than happy to pay extra if they would just mention it. 

All and all it's pretty good place.  Price is a little high, consider you can get all you can eat indian lunch buffet around $10.  But if you don't eat a lot, this is a great take out place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not such a special food. Had much better Indian foods.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is really good. I've had most of the items on their menu. I love their Naan.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This was my first time here, it was higly recommend by my coworkers to go here for lunch. The service was fast and the food was great. I had the 2 combo plate under $8. The flavor of the curry chicken spinach was very tasty.  The 2 combo plate will definitely fill you up.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was actually pleasantly surprised by the food they had. Usually I can't handle south asian food from outside because it is way too spicy but their food was pretty mild and still delicious! Highly recommended. Their prices are fair also.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just ate here. It was delicious and can't complain. Everything is good, especially the vegge korma. And one little tip, pay the extra .50 cents for the garlic naan.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food. Chicken masala delicious and the bread is amazing. People there are very nice and courteous.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried the food based on the reviews and was severely disappointed.  When getting any one of the combos you only get what is prepared, in other words it cannot be made spicy.  They gave me a container of hot sauce but the flavor was a mix of jalape√±o and mint, and it still was not spicy.
Also based on someone else's review, the sauce too sweet.  You would be better off going a few miles south to Punjabi (?) for better tasting food<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So so so incredibly good. Probably the best fast Indian food I've ever had in my life.

I usually get the three item combo with plain naan.  The goat and chicken curries are my go to.

Parking has never been a problem and the staff has always been kind.

I would seriously say there's nothing that you could get there that would be bad.

A much better choice than the Mediterranean caf√© in the same strip mall.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chicken Tikka Masala was a disappointment to my daughters who grew up with Indian food, and were looking for a new spot after the Brea restaurant we went to frequently, closed a few months ago.  

Both have declined to return, to try again, even though it is right on our way home, and I have asked several times.  Too (weirdly) sweet was the comment by both.  I have forgotten what entree I tried during our initial visit, but I had to agree that it was ok, but not what we are accustomed too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Curry hut is a great spot, i am not a big spicy food eater but the amount of spice is well balanced the garlic naan bread is also great to eat with the curry just rip it n start scooping<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was beyond a spicy and not good at all .. The meat is halal they don't tell you unless you ask... I definitely will not be coming back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best Indian food in Orange County. Great service, fresh food and unbeatable prices! Highly recommended!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was at first very excited that they opened up a curry joint in Fullerton but left the restaurant feeling a-ok. 

I got the Chicken Tikki Masala.. I always get this one at other various restaurants but I have never tasted such sweet curry in my life. It was way too sweet for me.

The garlic naan was also just whatevers. I have tasted better.

This is what I mean by this place being just o-k.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tikka masala is fantastic and they give you a big portion of naan. Like all Indian take out places the dishes seem to rotate in and out but they cover all the basics.

Prices are reasonable and comparable to all take out I've seen. However, the quality at this establishment is on par with sit down Indian restaurants. Highly recommend.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Cant get enough of this food! everything from the lentils to the chicken curry are great! The Mango Chutney is really great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place opened up about 3 months ago or so...but we didn't really have a decent Indian place around until Curry Hut came to town.  Now, I get dinner here about once a week and their flavors are amazing and to be able to walk in and walk out with amazing Indian food in less than 5 minutes is a godsend!  

At first look, the wild orange and green colors of the restaurant might give the appearance that the food can't be taken seriously...but, this is one place where looks are definitely deceiving.  

I'm Indian, so I know what I'm talkin about!  This food is great and I consider the owner a friend, as he's always happy to see me with a warm smile and a "how do ya do!"

Do yourself a favor and check this place out...you won't be disappointed if you like Indian food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am happy with the food and service I receive here. I did notice that the chicken tikka masala is oily. The food is not very spicy. It's offered buffet style where you can get 1-3 items with rice. It's standard items out front with made-to-order available (tandoori chicken dishes).

These are my standards:
Chicken Tikka Masala
Vegetable Korma
Samosas
Garlic Naan

The Samosas are bigger than I'm used to seeing and I really enjoyed them. Sometimes, restaurants can put too much seasoning and then all the potato tastes like is that one flavor. It hasn't happened for me yet, but I've only been here twice.

I felt that the portions were a good size. I have had leftovers the two times that I have been there.

I'm just glad I don't have to drive up the freeway if I'm having an emergency craving.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review will sound like a rant - so I will apologize in advance.

I love me some good Desi food - and this just doesn't cut it. I absolutely LOVE the idea of Indian fast food - but I've been here 3 separate occasions, and I am disappointed each time.

The concept of the restaurant is much like Panda Express - pick the amount of items, and then the gentleman will give you a half dollop of your selection. The items in the buffet never change... same 10 trays... every single time. 

It's a joke to spend an extra 50 cents on garlic naan. It's a pitiful amount the spread on there, and last I checked... 50 cents could buy me at least 2 cloves of garlic at the market.... so please don't be cheap and put a decent amount on the freakin' naan if you're going to charge me for it!

NONE of the dishes they serve are spicy. NONE.

They ALWAYS forget the Raita that is supposed to come with my combo plate.

Tikka Masala here is SWEET like butternut squash soup... you do not taste the garam masala spices AT all. 

The person working is ALWAYS on his cellphone. Homie, you're at work. Put the phone down. It's RUDE. 

This person that I always encounter behind the counter also wrote 2 fake reviews (along with other family members and friends) to boost the ratings for the store. 4 fake reviews all together have already been removed since the restaurant's opening 2 weeks ago. That for me is deceptive and I cannot respect a business that does that. Don't believe me? http://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/5xUzHQ94vYBiZIScToawrg 

Is this place cheap and convenient? Yes. However, I would much rather drive an extra 10 minutes and call in my order at a real Indian restaurant that can offer me better service and food for about $5 more bucks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love curry, Indian fast food, and it's time one came to Fullerton.  
One could go along and only comment on the food, and give it a 4 star rating, but when you factor in the filth factor of this place, you definitely take it down a notch. 
Food was fine, service was fine. What wasn't fine was the garbage stacked high, spilling over, on top of the trash cabinet. Cups, styrofoam containers, straws, napkins were overflowing, indicating that no one was assigned to do garbage duty throughout the day. Instead, both the counter help and the cook could be seen rushing to look at their Yelp ratings, rather than cleaning up. What they didn't realize was that by paying attention to their iPhones and computer, and ignoring the trash, that yes, this would be posted on Yelp.

Certainly, it's not a good sign for their future, if they're "above" such details as trash and cleanliness. What it signals is that they're overlooking other crucial things as well.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quick, healthy, and delicious Indian food! Everything prepared so no need to wait except for naan bread. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Love this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">FINALLY! Indian food in our neighborhood. Small mom-n-pop atmosphere which I like. Buffet-style. Friendly staff, great food, good prices. They'll let you sample anything which is how I wound up eating the spinach curry.   That spinach curry is amazing and I don't even like spinach!  
Suggestion: include Cheese Naan on the menu.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good service. Good food. 
Right when I first walked in I was welcomed. This was my first time coming to curry hut. I was unsure on how it would taste but before I even had to ask the worker offered me three samples of the different chicken they had: Tikka Marsala, Curry, and Spinach Curry. They all were delicious. He was very relaxed which made my experience there pleasant. I ended up getting the 3 combo: chicken curry, tikka Masala chicken and the curried cauliflower with rice and garlic bread. All this was around $10 which is affordable or a big lunch that will last ya to dinner. Really stoked that this is near my house.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's a combination of pre-made buffet style indian food and food to order. I got the vegetable Korma and the curry chicken which I'd totally recommend and I bought a full Tandoori chicken to go.  I was leaving and asked to use the bathroom in which they told they had no public bathroom! I just spent $35 and they tell me no bathroom for me to use! I've now edited my perfect review to them to being pissed  off.  I understand a token or a key but don't tell me I can't use a bathroom after a big meal. Bad business.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sweeeet! Inexpensive indian food in Fullerton! I'm so stoked!  I didnt know what to get so the owner made me a little sampler. Everything was delicious but I went with the 2-item plate.  I have no idea what my items are called but one is spinach-y and the other is cauliflower-y, and it comes with rice, raina, and naan bread.  Food isnt bad, owner was nice, and the price is on point.  So happy we have an indian food place here now :)

Also, 50 cents more for garlic naan is the best investment one could make.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like that their are open a bit later than other places. I ordered their chicken tikka masala and aloo naan. E chicken tikka masala is a bit in the sweet side however the naan here is amazing. Some of the best I've ever had. If you like a bit if the spicy kick, try the aloo naan.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their naan is VERY different and delicious! I only had the plain kind too :) The chicken tikki masala was pretty darn flavorful too. Great small fast food joint for the local flavor :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome food for the price! So glad this place is close to my house! It's more of a fast food type place. Not a place for a first date. More of a 5th date. There's a few tables inside but i usually take my food home. Worth a try!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fast food Indian?! Finally. It's a little on the saltier side but it wasn't bad. I figure if it doesn't have the expensive spices to fully compliment the dish adding a lil salt doesn't hurt the overall flavor too much. EEPS I might regret writing this. I got a three item combo with garlic naan. The spinach & chicken was awesome tho I would have liked it more with tofu or traditional cheese bits. The chicken curry had a great consistency but a lil on the oily side. Lastly the chicken tikka was fatty but helped keep the meat moist. Overall I loved it at the price point of $9? .50cent extra for garlic naan? What a deal, I think. I remember places in Tustin charging $2.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place tastes really authentic (coming from a person who grew up in India). They also have the best garlic naan I've ever tasted - it's SO fresh!
The combos are super affordable too. 
If you can get past the awful decor, you should definitely try it (I mean I know it's the color of the Indian flag, but there are so many better ways to decorate a place to make it look/feel like India!).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came to these guys to cater our LARGE family outing at the park. Ashish the Owner was very professional gave us good prices. He met with us before hand to make make sure we ordered everything we needed and were happy. The food was delivered earlier than anticipated. That was great considering people showed up early. Thanks so much Curry Hut!! Would defiantly use again for any catering needs. They were professional, on time, and everyone loved the food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great Indian food!  I'm hooked!!  My favorite is the Paneer Tikki. And honestly, I've tried almost everything, and have loved it all. It's worth going out of your way to enjoy. We usually take-out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The best Indian food I've eaten. The garlic naan is delicious. The location is convenient.. It's fast food but everything tastes fresh! This will be my new go to Indian food place. Great for lunch and dinner!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i LOVE Curry Hut.  Everything they make is great.  obviously Tikka Masala and Korma  are great, but you should try the goat curry, biryani, and other offerings.  IF YOU SEE THE OKRA TRY IT.  They don't make it often, but it is AMAZING.  I also prefer Roti to Naan or Kulcha.  Generally all around great food for fast food style indian.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food for reasonable price.

Combo is a nice option. Chicken curry , garlic naan and rice are good. Chicken biryani ( may should call it rice mixed with chicken curry) is not good..Chicken tikka is sweet and creemy..which i don't like. May be North Indians/Americans like it. As a south indian i like spicy food.

The lady at the billing counter is very friendly.

Overall i am satisfied ( since no good Indian restaurant near me)...anyway i'll come again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We stopped in on Saturday night, it was crowded but almost no desi people which worried me a bit because if the food tastes authentic you will find desi ppl that being said after tasting it I knew why there were no desis Zero spice! The food tasted Okay and the service was good, but food lacked spice and they gave way too much rice and naan for the amount of curry, and no raita! If you are looking for bland Indian food I guess it's okay but for real Indian food Artesia is always better and spicier! I don't love spicy food but there should be at least a little kick to Indian food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Being from England I have quite a high standard of Indian food. Curry is actually the most popular dish in England. Apart from a Pakistani restaurant in Colton this is actually the best Indian I have had in this Country. I recommend the Tikka Masala combo with the garlic naan (I often get the 3 item combo with all 3 items the Tikka Masala haha). Real cheap as well. I noticed that some reviews are bad saying that the food spilled all over the bag, while that is true how is that a bad thing, it just shows that they give you a generous portion.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was too good, it was my first visit i luvd it  definitely it is recommended place and services is excellent..! Specially recommend recipe is lamb curry<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tastes like homemade, and the owner couldn't be nicer. They're always quick, and the food is consistently tasty. I usually get the three item combo with chicken tikka masala, eggplant and plain naan. My hubby gets the same but with chicken tikka, goat curry and garlic naan. Now I'm hungry!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place!  Down right amazingly authentic delicious Indian fare at such fair reasonable prices!  My go to place whenever I come to visit my family in Fullerton - just wished we had this in Santa Monica. :(  Keep up the amazing job!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't you just love Indian food! Very busy place because it is delicious. Young lady at the register is very kind with a warm smile. I never pass on the chicken masala. Last week I ordered the spinach and cheese. Just dip your naan in that grub and enter into bliss. You know, I finally bought an ice cream from the freezer. The one with saffron to be exact. Just he flavor I have been hunting since childhood. Very creamy. The flavor was that of sweetened condensed milk. You know what I'm talking about. Gotta go. They are opening in less than an hour! Oh yeah. When you see mom and dad in the back cooking, you know it is going to be a delight.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really enjoyed this place, very colorful and fun. Quick too! Service was excellent. Food was delicious. I had some rice with some chicken tikka. It really hit me for my Indian food cravings I've been having lately. One of my pieces of Naan ended up a little burnt though, but still edible! 

My order ended up being a bit pricier than expected and they didn't give me back correct change.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pros: very reasonably priced, portions are good, high quality, freshly made naan included (50 cents more for garlic naan), very friendly staff, bollywood TV for your viewing pleasure

Cons: building is a bit run down, no restroom available

Bottom line: this place is quickly becoming a regular spot for me. If restaurant atmosphere is very important then this place won't work for you, otherwise you should absolutely come try the food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm in love with this place! Such a great menu, although I can't get enough of the Chicken Tikka Masala. Simply a must Every time! I could eat here 3 days a week and not ever burn out. The Naan is delicious! And for some reason I love watching the music videos while I'm eating. If you are ever looking for a fast fix of Indian cuisine, this is your stop. Open late too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Got the 2 combo plate with chicken tikka masala and the spinach with cheese. I was in food coma heaven after devouring everything. The curry was so so so good. Right when you open your tray up, the curry aroma punches you in the face with its complex spice notes. It's more of a sweet and savory curry, not spicy. The chicken was so tender and deliciously marinated in the curry. The spinach with cheese was too heavy for me, but I managed to finish it. Definitely getting the tikka masala again but I'll be switching out the spinach for something different.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Where else in So Cal can you go in, get some bomb chicken masala to go, and leave in 2 minutes? Enough said. Fills a need. Try it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Torn between three and four.  I have had Indian fast food while in London, maybe spoiled by it, and this just didn't quite make it.  However, I have not found any good Indian in all of LA.  Goat was good and the chicken was even better (Chicken was the four star recommendation.

Staff was very nice and definitely four star also.  The garlic naan was ok and the yogurt drink was nice also.  The oven cooked chicken was decent.

Overall the food is good, especially if you factor that it is fast food/combo under $10<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had this for lunch last week and it was very delicious. I had the 2-item combo with chicken tikka masala and the potato/cauliflower with garlic naan. The portion sizes felt just right for me. I will definitely be coming back to try some of their other items.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was just passing by and I saw this new spot, very clean quality food and friendly stuff, price is right and taste was great I will always go back .

                 Keep it up guys<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place was so good! Had their chicken tika with garlic naan... Amazing! And good price :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is great. The chicken tikka and garlic naan have great flavor! I would recommend this place to anybody trying to get their fix of indian food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really not my favorite.  The Tikka masala was sweet and i could not eat it.  Nice people, but i wouldn't recommend it.  I expect Indian food to be flavorful and pack a real flavor punch.  This was bland.  And the naan tasted like it was made with Bisquick.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Garlic naan was beyond my expectations! I will go there and just order that! Food was great for Indian fast food and good prices.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I purchased the two item combo with chicken curry and chicken tikka masala. The combos come with rice and naan-I opted for the garlic naan at an extra 50 cents. The chicken tikka masala was amazing. Everything was fresh and delicious and the staff seemed very nice and genuine. Definitely coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food to satisfy the Indian food craving. I paid $10.25 for the 3 item combo (I opted for two portions of chicken tikka masala & one portion of the aloo gobi) and 2 pieces of garlic naan ($0.50 up charge for the garlic flavor). The portion was too small for a 3 item combo and I would expect that a 2 item combo offer that amount of food. There was more sauce & "slop" than there was chicken which was a little disconcerting being that it was supposed to be two portions of the chicken tikka masala and it felt like tad amount of chicken they plated was no more than one scoop. I say scoop because it's not all made to order. It's buffet style behind the glass so you can't choose the level of spiciness. The rice was really good & so was the naan but again it didn't seem like ten bucks worth of food. I would still go back if I craved Indian in the future. The service was fine also... A nice lady helped me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome food for being a quick serve place! I love indian food and their's is awesome. You can get a 1,2, or 3 item combo which comes with rice and naan. I always upgrade to the garlic naan for $0.50 and you get 2 pieces! Generous portions too. I get the chicken tikka masala and the vegetable korma. Soooooo good. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good, quick place to grab a bite!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Finally stopped by Curry Hut last night after eyeing it for over a year. 
We were greeted with great customer service very friendly and even offered samples to help us decide what to order. 
The food was really good I'm not HUGE on Curry but definitely enjoyed it for a change. We ordered the Mikka Chicken (i think that's what it is called) and the regular Chicken Curry both of which were good. The mixed veggies were also very good (the sauce on the veggies was great). 
Lastly, we ordered both the hot and cold dessert which I honestly wouldn't recommend BUT the food was definitely good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">8 Oz for $3.50 of Chicken Tikka Masala. Garlic Naan uses real garlic. For this area, this I'm happy to support this establishment.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">WOW! First time eating here, but definitely not the last. Delicious food. Chicken Curry was great and the garlic bread is addicting!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is like panda express but indian food, i liked the naan and the chicken tikka but the spinach chicken didnt taste that great, i like the bollywood songs they had on the tv and the girl that helped me was polite and seemed to enjoy her job.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">On my way home from school I was craving some Indian curry and absolutely had to try this place! The food is great; I first ordered the one item combo (spinach and cheese) but I couldn't resist just trying one and ordered another item (vegetable korma). Fast service, cheap, great food, beautiful, colorful interior...I can't wait to bring some friends, come back and try their other curries!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I brought some Curry Hut for some docs I work with and let me tell you the best indian food i have ever had! must try the goat curry and garlic naan! The service is great and the music is awesome! This will be my local spot from now on.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! Soooooooo good, the food is amazing and the service was awesome. My only complaint is that they aren't closer to where I live. I would eat there almost everyday if I could.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good, cheap, and tasty def recommend this place . also the garlic naan is the best, also the sound when you walk in.... Priceless!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love love LOVE this place! One of those hole-in-the-wall gems. We come for lunch a few times a month. My wife and I split a 2- item combo with chicken tikka masala for both items and it's plenty for us. We both prefer milder food and their tikka masala is very mild but VERY creamy and flavorful! We also order an extra plain naan - some of the best we've ever had. We find Curry Hut reasonably priced.

I also love their hot tea, but if you're in a hurry make sure to call it in ahead of time as it normally takes about 10 minutes to prepare.

Parking can be difficult during the lunch rush, but it's worth it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've had the garlic naan, and not the chicken and veggie samosas, and neither disappointed me! The samosas were perfectly seasoned and super yummy! Every item was so fresh and flavorful, the service was great and welcoming, and I will definitely be coming back here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is always fresh and ready. For those new to Indian food, all the dishes are written in English so you know exactly what you're getting. Best naan and vegetable korma around!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of my favorite eateries in Fullerton. It is fast and affordable with amazing quality. I've had a difficult time finding better Indian anywhere else. They are always welcoming and let you try samples before committing to a certain dish. I would absolutely recommend this place if you are looking for great food fast.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lucky Fullerton to have this fabulous take-out restaurant!  I always order the spinach cheese, vegetable korma, garlic naan, and sometimes what I believe is the lentils with a tikka masala sauce dish.  YUM!  Don't miss it.  The prices are reasonable too. I want to try new things, and I'm not a vegetarian, but I just love those dishes so much that I haven't veered from my favorites. I once tried the goat curry, which a friend ordered, and loved it too.  The woman who works up front is lovely and helpful and always willing to give samples. There are also a few places to sit inside, but I prefer bringing it home and opening a beer or a glass of wine to accompany my delicious Indian dinner.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is delicious!  I crave it every once in a while...the girl at the register wasnt really nice though.  I would def come back to pick up some food though!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been to many high end, expensive Indian/Pakistani restaurants. This place has been my no. 1 favorite place.  Somehow this restaurant's chicken Masala is so addictive. The restaurant isn't fancy at all. Moreover  it is pretty far away from where i live but i still to go from here often since no restaurants can taste better than this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food and great service. Tony is great. He has what it takes to make good food and have that personal touch of service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went here for the first time today, and my only regret was not eating here sooner. The chicken tk masala is my new comfort food for life. It was creamy and so perfectly flavorful I could cry. Keep it up curry hut, keep it up.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's in the closest proximity to me and I just love the biryani they make.. You can have options to choose your own combos and try variety of Indian food.. Ultimately delicious and inexpensive food.. If u like Indian food then you'll love all the food they make. Try the best chicken biryani which is my favorite too!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious Indian food at great prices! My husband and I each got a two item combo. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala with Spinach and Cheese and he had the Tandoori Chicken and the Aloo Gobi. Also, had the garlic naan. The flavors were amazing, with the perfect amount of spice! We will definitely be coming back soon!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time not so good. To strong for my my liking but that's not their fault. My adult son however, had to take out "multiple" pieces of really small bones. Unfortunately we won't be going back..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Garlic naan was good. The food was sub par. The BBQ flavor  was not very good in the chicken tikka. The chicken curry had no flavor. I hope that they can tweak their recipes for a better food experience. I don't think I will ever visit again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their veggie korma is damn good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I cannot speak enough of this place. My husband and I visited Curry Hut today, based on such great word of mouth. We love Indian food, and have a few other favorites in OC. This place is PHENOMENAL. Everything from the rice to the eggplant, we were floored! The best part is the food is affordable, healthier than other "fast food", and the service is great. We plan to make this our regular Indian food source. Just wonderful!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of my favorite new places! I always get the combo and replace it with garlic naan which you get two large pieces of, I also get the chicken tikka or the curry chicken. The vegetable samosas are amazing but can sometimes be a little spicy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Since it's opened, I've been going and getting samosas....SO GOOD!! However, came here last week for the chicken tikka masala for my boss and she got good poisoning!!! Not cool at all......<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was pleasantly surprised to walk in and get smacked in the face with the strongest scent of curry. Couldn't say I'm complaining though because it just made me more hungry. They offer a variety of combo choices and sides which was nice but made it difficult for me because I wanted to eat everything. The man working the register was extremely friendly and ready to answer any questions we had pertaining to flavor, and description of the food choices. He was really sweet and let us taste some of the foods too and suggested I try a dish with a yogurt base that was spicy and had veggie dumplings in it. So good! Their garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and....well everything was basically super yummy! I couldn't stop myself from ordering a mango lassi too (don't judge me). Altogether really good with reasonable prices that any college student or person on their lunch break could appreciate. Definitely going back soon!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's always fun to see a place with great reviews except for the one hater who thinks she's an expert and then overcompensates by being petty and ugly. This place is good Indian fast food. We're lucky to have it in town. The garlic naan is fresh and crispy and between the five if us we had everything but the goat and enjoyed it all.  Ask for samples and they will tell you about the various dishes. Super cool<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The naan is out of this world. The rice is also really good. I wish they gave you a little more meat, but for the price, it's totally worth it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is awesome.  Delicious, fresh, authentic, & great customer service!  Can't wait to return!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was very impressed with the quality for the price. The staff was also very kind. Really glad to have a cheaper Indian alternative in fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place. The tikka masala, naan, and rice flavor combinations are amazing. The food is delicious! I look forward to trying other offerings from curry hut and plan to spend a lot of time and money here in the future. I also like that it is carry out. Although the level of service at most Indian restaurants is very nice, sometimes i just want to enjoy the food without the feeling of being watched. Eating at home is a definite bonus here :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wonderful service; curry chicken tastes pretty good and full of flavor; tikka masala is good too. Portions are fairly large and filling. The eggplant was okay but not as tasty as the chicken (could be chopped up into smaller pieces to absorb the flavor). Good stuff, especially for fast food! Likely I will be coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow, what a great find!  I was at the post office and saw the sign for this restaurant.  I asked my husband, who has visited India many times, if he wanted to try this restaurant.  We both loved the food.  It is the best curry I've had in a very long time.   

A couple who spend half their time in India and the other half here in the United States were eating there and said it is "authentic".

Highly recommend it.  We are going back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is soooooooo good. Fullerton needed an Indian food place on this area and I'm happy about this one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place. Never had a bad meal here. The Naan bread is made to order and the mango chutney is delicious. Also love their potatoes and cauliflower dish. The only bad thing is the parking lot is crowded at lunchtime and there are usually no spots.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A nice small Indian place that gets packed and serves good food. Chicken Tikka Masala and Goat Curry with Garlic Naan were really good, not too spicy unlike other Indian places that I've tried. It was perfect.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yummy! Friendly staff, yummy food, super reasonable. The goat curry and saag paneer were my fav's......and don't forget to say yes to the garlic naan!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Did take out a couple of saturdays ago.  Very nice to have an indian food outlet in Fullerton, finally!  For me, it's right on my way home from work.  Hopefully, they'll expand their menu over time.  Pretty limited, although, they have goat curry!!  Would like to see shrimp added.  It looks like its strictly buffet-style, even the tandoori chicken except for the naan and fried items.  It's a nice solid take out place, a great alternative.  But, if I've got the time, I'd go to Punjab Tandoori in Anheim.  Bigger menu with spicer options.  I hope Curry Hut is around a long time - They deserve our support!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can not tell you how happy I am to have UHmazing Indian food in Fullerton!!! Very fresh, quick, great authentic food and staff that loves what they're doing. I would drive 20 minutes to get my favorite Indian food in Buena Park and I was more than stoked when I walked into Curry Hut to see it was all the same dudes! Glad I only have to drive 2 minutes now.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is good for my random cravings of Indian food. They selection of food is limited. I got the 2 item plate (8.99) and garlic naan (extra .50). The naan is really fresh. they cook it right when you order it. Also it is nice and thin. But be careful it is really hot. I tried their goat curry and chicken tikka masala. I think the chicken curry would have been better. The goat only came with like 3-4 pieces.  Other than that, it is not bad. I really like their garlic naan.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Holy shit balls!  This place is LEGIT! I'm in love with INDIAN food and couldn't find any fast food joints like this one anywhere.  Until last night.  I ordered the 2 item combo with the Mango Lassi.  WOW!  The saag paneer & chicken tiki masala w/ rice and garlic naan was a complete and utter HIT!  This will now be my go to place for solid Indian food.  Can't wait to go back!<p>
</p></p>
