<p itemprop="description">I have been coming here for a long time, but am writing a review now. I went here with my boyfriend this time and ordered egg rolls, brisket pho bowl and this rice with tofu and vegetables. The egg rolls and spring rolls here are excellent! I recommend it. Egg rolls are so crispy and hot! The ambiance of the restaurant is so cozy and comfortable. It feels nice being in here so i like coming here with special people i like. It is also near my home, and i dont think the price is that bad. The pho with brisket was very good too. The soup was excellent and savory.
I never tried the rice before here, only the chicken salad, which is also very delicious.
The rice with tofu and veggies was very good and satisfying. It was too much food, so we couldnt finish it. 
My only complaint is that, this time we went,, there was this server who served us that was sort of rude. He looked like he didnt want to work here and when i asked for more napkins, he gave two single piece of napkins. Really????
Also, when i said more water please, he pointed at the water cups to say for me to give the water cups to him, so that he can pour more water.
He could have just communicated via word, instead of pointing his fingers without saying anything.
So, yeah,,, i was a bit shocked, but it didnt bother me much.
I still like coming here and i have been a faithful customer for many years that's why.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pho is decent, I'd give it 4 stars. The 2 stars go to service. I walk in near opening and politely ask if the place is open (since their doors were wide open, and I wasn't sure if they were still cleaning and prepping). I didn't even receive an answer, just a gesture as to where to sit, which is fine, I guess. A menu is then placed on the table, and immediately after, a "what do you want?"

It's one of my first times visiting and they just drop a faded menu in front of me and expect me to decide instantly. Greeeaaaaatt customer service. 

After ordering, my next interaction with the server was the bill. Server didn't check up on me and just dropped the bill off in the middle of my meal. When I was the only one in the fucking restaurant. I felt rushed, paid, and just left since it was probably the worst service I've ever received anywhere.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lunch special includes N-1 which is choice of regular size pho + fried rice and egg roll ($10.95).  Prices run a bit higher for pho.  It was a decent size for lunch and broth was good, but not as flavorful as expected.  Fried rice (although colored and looked savory) and egg roll were surprisingly quite bland.  

I read a previous review that the pho broth was not as flavorful because they do not use MSG.  Not sure if this is true, because I found myself extremely thirsty and tired after this meal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Egg rolls are not supposed to look like this on the inside. I have eaten here plenty of times and ordered their eggrolls. This is the first time it came out reddish-pink. The server apologized and  replaced one of the eggrolls. As that eggroll was cooking, i took a bite out of another eggroll but it was the same. The server apologized and took it off the table to replace it but came back a few seconds later and said "its cooked, thats just the carrots." I further opened up the eggroll and knew it was NOT just the carrots. When we received the other eggroll to replace the first one we told her was raw, it was also uncooked on the inside.....like i said, i eat here frequently and order the eggrolls so this was not cooked. I left my credit card next tot the raw eggrolls so the server could see that the eggrolls were raw. She said nothing about it. I wish she acknowleded their mistake. I will post the picture of the eggrolls and you can judge f
 Their pho thai is good though - meat is very tender.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very clean and chic Vietnamese restaurant. 

Their menu is very limited. They mostly have pho and a few variations of rice plates. You will not be seeing bun bo hue here! 

I ordered the N-1, the broth was very clean! No oil droplets are to be seen anywhere. Their egg rolls were piping hot, flaky and delicious! 

It is a tad pricier than most authentic Vietnamese restaurants. But the price is compensated by their cleanliness in their decor and food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When you crave a good bowl of pho, you go to Garden Grove/Westminster area where you know it's authentic and tasty.  Pho Olivia caters to the residents of Fullerton, who are generally not Vietnamese.  You get the picture? 

Pho Olivia seems really small, but it is on the left side of the 99 cent store.  It's next to a Thai place at the corner.  Parking is easy, but the lot gets crowded from Quickly customers.  You might have to park in the back section.  The interior of the restaurant seems spacious because of how they organize their tables, but I like the booth seating.  Restroom is available.

Their menu is not bad.  You can get spring rolls and broken rice dishes here.  They also have chocolate cake for dessert.  Prices are slightly on the higher side.  I'm pretty sure they raised prices since the last time I was here a year ago.  Small bowl of pho is $8.95.  Large is $9.95.  They even have a super size.  

N-2 Rare Beef Pho.  The beef was so unusually chewy.  I'm not used to this consistency.  Perhaps they did not cook all the way because the meat was served half pink and the soup was getting warm.  The broth was just ok.  Last year I secretly accused them of using too much MSG, so I never came back.  I think they worked on that because I didn't feel so sick after my meal.  Will I be back?  Eh, probably not.

Service is lacking.  The guys are friendly but some of them act so green like they're new.  It seemed like only one guy knew what he was doing.  When the server brought my pho to the table, he stepped on my foot and turned around without apologizing.  

TL;DR  If you're too lazy to go to Garden Grove, go to Pho Ha in Brea.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in for their lunch special today but got there a little bit earlier than my lunch date. The waiter immediately seated me and brought me water and a menu even though I would be waiting for awhile.

I don't usually have pho in this area but I found their lunch special to not only be tasty but also relatively well-priced.  All lunch specials come with an egg roll and a small portion of fried rice. What stood out to me the most was their noodle bowls which gave ALOT of meat. Most places give 5 to 6 slices in a bowl, this spot easily gives double that amount. 

If you're in the area for lunch and looking for some pho I would recommend this place. You pay what you get for, and I mean that in a good way. There isn't any thing that puts them in to the five star zone, but a solid choice for some good grub<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's the best pho we've tried in Fullerton so far. The food was tasty and fresh. Customer service was slow but if we wanted pho again we'd most likely go back and eat there!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm from Westminster, and I know good Pho.  I tried this place based on the Yelp ratings, but was disappointed.  When rating Pho, the broth is EVERYTHING.  This broth was way salty and had very little flavor because of the sodium content.  Secondly, the protein ratio was lacking, badly!  There was very little beef.  I probably will not go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pho Olivia is so satisfying! 

Food: I loved the taste of the flavorful broth & tender brisket. The soup is served hot unlike other pho places I've been to. The portions are pretty big and the prices are decent! It was about $8 for a small and I believe large was just under $12. 

Service: We had 2 welcoming servers and they both wore smiles on their faces the entire time. They always asked if we needed anything and didn't rush us to pay.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My FAVORITE pho place. I absolutely love pho, and I have been to several places. This restaurant has the greatest flavor broth and the best Thai iced tea (not too strong like most places) but what makes it the best is the super sweet server there! I forgot his name but he's always smiling, always in a good mood, and makes your eating experience overall better! Definitely recommend this spot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very, very disappointing!!  My son and I ordered the largest pho bowl ( I think over $11 per bowl - he treated, so I am not sure ), and.......if I could given them a negative rating, I would. To begin, both his bowl, as well as mine, had EXACTLY 4 PAPER THIN slices of beef.  We both complained - management did not give a shit!!  So, we proceeded to eat.  The broth tasted like soap water.  I called the waiter to complain.  Guess what??!!  If I did not get it the first time, well, they made it abundantly clear they DO NOT care for your opinion!  Food Is CRAP, and so is customer diservice!!  With soooo many restaurants competing for your business, do not waste your money, and your time here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't know why this place has such good ratings. Ordered an Olivia combo 3 and was sorely disappointed. The combo is a RIPOFF. Tiniest side of fried rice and poorest excuse of a salad I've seen. See picture attached. I asked if this was the normal size and got a response full of attitude.

The pho was sadly one of the worst I've had in the area. The noodles were overcooked and the broth was greasy.

Plenty of other places to go in the area. Maybe other things are better here but I wouldn't be surprised if the portions are also ridiculous. I see other reviews here saying their portions are small.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The BBQ pork rice and spring rolls are excellent.  Service is fast and efficient.  Prices are good.

Brother says the pho is amazing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not bad.  I've came here on several occasions on Sunday afternoons for lunch with typically about 8-10 people.  The place is never packed to the fullest, so it's been very easy to find seats for large groups.  I've had different dishes, including the pho, dry garlic noodles, and the banh xeo. The pho broth is pretty good, in fact I typically ask for the broth to bring home (around 3.50$) whenever I just feel like reheating it up for later.  The dry egg noodles are pretty tasty and flavorful.  I've had it with the grilled shrimp and was not disappointed.  The banh xeo is also pretty good!  I liked that the portion was reasonably big, enough to bring home for dinner/ lunch the next day. 
All in all, definitely would recommend this joint if you're craving Vietnamese food in Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually go in on a rainy day with my family to eat here, and it is one of the better Pho places in the area. The broth here is ok, and doesn't wreak of MSG like a lot of places. I've heard some folks say the broth is bland, but actually, you can season it a bit with salt if you need to make the broth a little more salty to your liking. The thing is, the broth very neat and with a clean taste. This is what you want for good broth. I usually get the Bun here (vermicelli noodles with shrimp, bbq pork, and egg rolls). The Bun here is good. I enjoy the portions and the dish is done right. Pretty happy!

The dining room is clean and the lights are dim and inviting for you to stay awhile and enjoy the food! 

As long as I live around here, I'm a regular.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We loved the food and great costumer service from the owner Olivia ... She is a hard working lady ... Always making sure everything was ok and making sure we needed anything else<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Last Sunday my sister SUPER HUNGOVER after day drinking in Newport Beach. My usual spot for Pho is not open on Sundays so the BF suggested we go to Pho Olivia. We did NOT eat in the restaurant this is a review for our "to go" or "takeaway" order. Let's start off with...we had the most difficult time getting through when calling in our order. The BF called and I called numerous times...and I was lucky enough to finally get through. My usual order is pho tai (rare beef)...I know my sister doesn't eat all the other stuff...such as tripe or tendon etc...so we ordered 4 large pho tai's and an order of spring rolls to go. The lady who took my order stated 20 minutes. 

We drove to Cal State Fullerton area to the little corner of the plaza where Pho Olivia is. We walk in and pay...to be honest I was a bit shocked...i think it was like $42 for the whole order...(a bit expensive for pho no?) Anyway I asked the lady to give me an extra bag and a separate little side of veggies for my sister. I was dropping off the meal for her and didn't want to have to separate things out later. 

Anyway...now to my food. When I was getting my meal together i discovered that THEY forgot to give us BASIL! WHAT? Also...I really feel like we needed more broth...especially since we all ordered larges...and it seemed like there was basically NO SOUP. Maybe it's different if you eat there?

I didn't try the spring rolls but...they were TINY. 

Anyway I don't think I'll be coming back to Pho Olivia anytime soon. Pass.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is a diamond in the rough! The ambience is artistic and immaculate. I was impressed by the menu selection for Vegans and decided to order the spring roll with tofu and basil which is served with a yellow dipping sauce that's texture is like butternut squash soup but has a more beef savory flavor. Our service was prompt and genuine. The music was acoustic rock which was refreshing and nostalgic at the same time. The Pho 
brisket lacked the strong beef flavor we're used to but overall the food is great. Full from all the egg rolls and pho, a glass of young coconut juice was the perfect dessert for my palate!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm from the SGV area where pho is found everywhere & the prices here are so crazy high! Its about $8-$9 but back in my area its like $6-$7. 
The food is okay. I come during the lunch special when they give you the extra eggroll & friend rice along with your pho. The eggroll isn't fresh & the fried rice and dry. The veggie plate that comes with the pho is really small!! I love my beansprouts but too bad theres so little. 
Service here is fast. They just take your order & give you your food but its not too hard to flag them down. 
All in all, I would go here if I'm craving pho just because there arent that many choices around CSUF.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for dinner because I was in the area!
I am normally used to the Pho in the Garden Grove/Westminster area, with that in mind ... 

Pretty decent pho establishment if you are craving it and are in the area. 
Located near the 99 Cents store, it's located in the back left hand corner of the plaza. 

Inside, very clean, the seats on the booths were cracked, but it didn't really bother me that much. 

Waiters were attentive and polite! 

I ordered the rare beef and brisket pho, bf ordered the seafood pho, and we added the pork spring roll appetizer. 

The pork spring rolls were pretty good! The sauce didn't really taste like the peanut sauce I was used to, but it was still delicious. No vermicelli noodles in the pork spring rolls. 

Pho was decent. 
I didn't think there was enough flavoring, I felt like it was a bit watered down. 
Definitely hot enough though! They give you really big portions. I thought large would be a decent size, but I couldn't even finish it. Unfortunately, they don't give you that much meat. 

Had some of the boyfriend's seafood pho, and the broth tasted a lot better. 
However, seafood was the frozen/imitation kind - but I was not surprised. 

Our bill came out to be around $30 for the both of us - kind of expensive for 2 bowls of okay pho and 2 spring rolls. 

Probably won't be back unless I'm craving it and stuck in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is probably one of my favorite pho places!! Their broth is delicious and they are very generous with their portions!

Also got their shrimp rockets this time and boy are they tasty. Nice and crispy on the outside and then sooooooo juicy and succulent on the inside! Couldn't have asked for a better appetizer :)

I see they've gotten some bad reviews but I think it's just really important to order the right things! I've never tried their rice dishes but I believe their pho is great!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this pho place!!!
I've been here a lot of times. They are super friendly and quick.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pho Olivia is one of my favorite places to go! 

It's never very crowded and if it is, you still get great service!

They have an awesome combo deal for lunch and dinner where you can get your choice of pho with an egg roll and fried rice for about $1 more depending on which one you choose. My boyfriend and I love this since ordering a side of egg rolls or spring rolls is usually around $4 most places, and we can never finish them anyways. 

I absolutely love their broth! It's not super salty like most places, it's perfect. 

If I'm at Fullerton (which I usually am), Pho Olivia is the place to go!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OK I usually really like this place since service is really good but I need to rethink going here. I got a regular size pho with egg roll appetizer and 2 coconut waters. I asked for them to make sure to have lettuce on the side since that's usually how other pho places have it. Why does this place charge an extra dollar for that? But w/e a dollar ok I'll pay it. Well I had ordered for pick up and when the girl finished the coconut water, why the heck did one of them come only half full and the other 2/3 full? Apparently theyre so tied for food and drink that just because I asked for easy ice on one it means I'm getting less drink. Don't be stingy or change the size of your cups of you're not going to fill it to the top. Also, my grand total was $23 and change, for a 1 person dinner and 2 drinks. Wtf<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was okay. I got a combo with fried rice, egg roll and house salad. All of the portions were fairly small and the iceberg lettuce for the salad looked kind of old.

The service was a bit spotty and even though we were very nice and said thank you with a smile, the waiter never bothered to acknowledge us and would just walk off.

The basil and bean sprouts they gave us looked like they had been sitting there for a very long time. They looked dirty, dead, black edges and shriveled. Sorry excuse for condiments.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The V6 and the N2 are my favorites on the menu.  The service is great and theprice is reasonable.  This used to be a Bionic Records and that was pretty cool, but I'm not disappointed with the business that's taken over since then.  Glad we have a great Pho spot in Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Overall: Great service, decent food 

I got the BBQ pork which comes w white rice, butter garlic rice, pork, and some veggies: 
1. Portion - Average amount, I was able to finish everthing and get comfortably full
2. Interior - Nicely furnished and clean 
3. Service - Very friendly! He checked up on us a couple of times and cleared the plates
4. Food - Just your average Vietnamese BBQ pork<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been coming here for years and have loved this place.  I came here tonight and whoever changed management did so for the worse not better.

Also we asked for seating for five.  I went to the bathroom and felt "wetness" on the door handle.  What was that?!

As well, when I got back, there was four not five menus at the table. 

The chopsticks at the whole table were filthy and if they are not cleaning those...what else are they not cleaning?  And why not get disposable at that point?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Disgusting and inedible. Ate some just to please my bf. Garlic rice doesn't taste like garlic and the shrimp were so overcooked you could barely chew it. The noodles were sticky and tasteless...you could just tatse sugar. Worst Pho I've had.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time coming here.  It is next to a 99cent store and several smaller restaurants (Thailandia and other restaurants).  

First impression: Decor is nice.  It is a good place to take friends and family.  I went with friends before the lunch rush (approximately 11:30am).  The staff was friendly and really nice.  

Menu: There is a special lunch menu that has 3 items (ranging from pho and appetizer or vermicelli and appeteizer for around $10).  I got the super sized pho (which is $10.95).   It was good and filling.  I measure a good pho whether i have to add hoison sauce or sriracha.  I didn't need to add these sauces because the broth was good.  This broth was clean and great tasting.  They didn't skimp on the meat and had plenty of noodles.

I also had the vietnamese coffee.  It was ok.  

Definitely would come back again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">MSG was evident in the pho broth, but it wasn't too bad as some other places. The coffee without condensed milk was really really sweet, which shouldn't be the case. The coffee with the condensed milk tasted just like the one without except a more milky taste. Great service though!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've come here on a few different occasions and I'm always super impressed. Not only is the food great, but it comes out super quick and the staff are all wonderful! Super friendly and willing to help :) our favorite is the Olivia spring rolls!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Found my new PHO place!!! Lived in the area for years and finally decided to try it out. Smells a little weird walking in but once you get your amazing soup you can't smell anything but it's goodness. Love the flavor of the broth and the fact that they DO NOT use cilantro which I passionately don't like. They do use a lot of onion both white and green which I LOVED!! There egg rolls which are pork are super yummy!!!!!! Also my brother got lemonade as his drink and he loved it, it had a hint of coconut which he doesn't really like and he loved this drink combination. Excited for more pho at this place!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This small pho restaurant is located in a slightly sketchy 99 cent store plaza. However, don't let that deter you because the service here is excellent and beyond most pho restaurants/Asian restaurants in general. The servers are particularly smiley and attentive. I usually get the chicken pho bowl and the broth is darn tasty and I love that they serve you actual chicken breast pieces instead of super thin slices like other places. 

Pho Olivia is my new go-to, especially since I live in the area. I love Pho Ha and a few others in the Rowland area but this place can easily be a replacement for the Brea/Fullerton area. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pho here is GREAT. I work and go to school in this area, and despite always passing by, I've never given it a chance. Any frequent pho-goer would know that pho is only good in predominately Vietnamese areas, and Fullerton just doesn't make the cut as one of them. However, I decided to give it a try and let me just say it definitely doesn't disappoint. 

I ordered the N-4, which is rare beef and brisket. The meat here is thinly sliced (usually a indication of good pho) and the broth is above average. The broth itself isn't the best I've had, but relative to this area, it's about the best you can ask for. I'm raving about the meat because that's what put it together. The beef and brisket was just so soft and tender. 

Service is good, too. They were helpful and came around to ask how I was doing frequently. If you're in the area and craving some pho, this is your go-to place. The best I've had in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I always love coming here with my super picky husband. He hates pho everywhere else but here. Clean and modern interior. Friendly staff. The pho is always delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was in the area and felt a huge craving for some pho. Lo and behold, I felt that everything was just average and nothing really impressed me.

We ordered the shrimp spring rolls, and the shrimp was small, and everything else tasted bland. It was a disappointment. I got the chicken pho, and I was sad about how the chicken was prepared. It was boiled rather than served with the meat and skin (since that's how I like my chicken pho).

The noodles were great - I liked the texture and taste. But the broth lacked flavor and tasted weak. For those who want to get great deals, I recommend coming here for their lunch specials. Even though service was friendly and they bring the food out to you in a timely manner, the lack of taste was bothersome.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service! We ordered the large pho and spring rolls and bother were delicious. The broth tasted clean and the spring rolls tasted kind of like the rolls from bardot. Prices are higher than other places but great place to eat esp because of the immaculate service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I've been to other authentic Vietnamese Pho houses and this place is a rip off -over priced paired with horrible quality of food. I ordered the vermicelli with pork bbq which was nothing but burnt and some tasteless peices. 
We ordered some extra bbq($3.95) to share since I can't eat that much noodles alone. Apparently the extra was already mixed in which looked like a regular size serving. So... how much less would I have gotten then?  
Anyways.  Not again. I should have just drove a little more to Pho Ha on imperial and 57 exit by lucilles.  

Oh yeah my total bill was $16.68<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">avoid going here by all cost.  i was there on sept 13th and was charged twice for 19.93. and when i called to rectify the issue. they pretended that they don't speak english and never isue a refund for me.  please avoid coming here.  they obviously have ethic issues.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very welcoming, came in during lunch on a weekday with no wait, hospitabel staff, and the pho was very dialed. 

I enjoy the atmosphere, and the assortment of veggies on the plate.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of our family favorites. We go here as often as we can. The atmosphere is really relaxing. The food is very good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Outstanding! Great Pho! The broth is incredible, especially if you are sick.  Clean place and friendly service. Olivia herself almost always greets us! Definitely give it a try!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went to this place a couple weeks ago, and forgot to write a review for it..

Me and my girlfriend went on a weekday night, and the restaurant was very slow. We got a couple of the chicken skewers and one of the Pho combos with rice, spring rolls and a salad. 

I'm not a fan of Pho, so that was for my girlfriend and I ate the rest of the stuff that came with the combo plate, as well as most of the chicken skewers. 

I had been here once before, and had an average experience. I ordered a chicken and rice dish. From what I remember, the portion of chicken was EXTREMELY small. (think literally like 3 ounces) and appeared to be undercooked. Whether or not it was raw, I can't really tell you, but I felt uncomfortable enough with how it looked to send it back. The waiter made sending it back an extremely awkward experience, even though I insisted I just didn't want it and didn't want it replaced since I lost my appetite. 

I was willing to give it another shot, especially considering my girlfriend loves Pho and theres not many good places around here for Pho. The portion of the sides for the combo were understandably small, considering the Pho was the main component of the combo. But their "chicken" fried rice was a joke, as it just has three tiny shrivels of chicken on it that are cooked to hell. The salad was the only thing I liked, everything else was pretty bland, including the chicken skewers. 

The service was just as crappy as it was the first time. The restaurant was completely empty by the time we ordered, yet it took 20+ minutes for my girlfriend to get her Pho. It didn't really make sense. Our waiter dropped off our check relatively early, which I always appreciate since we would have the option to pay early if we needed to leave. Once i put my card in however, it was impossible to find out where the hell the waiter went. The restaurant had 0 customers and 0 employees in it, and we were just trying to pay so we could leave. I'd say it took another 10-15 minutes for them to finally come out and process my card. Again, really really bad service.

The worst part of my experience was the day after... Pho Olivia was the last thing I ate the day before, and in the morning I started puking it all out. I couldn't even drink water without it coming back out until around 6-7 PM the next day. Needless to say, I will definitely not be coming back to this place, ever. Below average food (besides the Pho), below average service, and they got me sick.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of the best vietnamese restaurant in the area. Ordered the phò few times and always enjoyed the flavorful broth. One another note, definitely recommended the rice plate with their yellow rice, i believe it was garlic butter rice. Best thing ever with the tender and flavorful meat of your choice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Would give 4stars but hubby thinks 3. He says it was hot in there (true) and service was slow & spotty (but we were in no hurry.) 

Pho is tasty  but ask for extra add-in plates (sprouts/basil/lime...). Delicious pork spring rolls. The seafood omelette is ok but I don't have anything to compare it to. House Salad is beautiful & huge & delicious! Dessert is good--hard to mess up uncomplicated banana chocolate crepes that my 3yr old licked the plate for. 

Looks like it gets busy quickly , the place is small. 

Good, easy place to visit on a casual evening.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So like any pho place I guess we expect 3 things; fast, quick, and is it hot? Well those are my three things. I just really want the pho to be hot not warm or room temperature, but hot. This wasn't the case with pho Olivia; the pho was ehhh, the taste was ehhhh. The service was good so I'm giving them 3; wish it was hot and tasted a little better. 
Btw; this pho place is a little more pricier than most places. BUT they do have an x large bowl for those that are xtra hungry<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Another weekend lunch with a friend. I always thought that you have to go to Little Saigon to get good pho. I was wrong! They serve very fresh Vietnamese food here. The restaurant was clean and food came out pretty quickly. Spring Rolls were so fresh and the rice paper was so soft and moist. My Shrimp Pho was delicious too. When they brought my pho, I could not see shrimp. But as soon as I started eating, shrimp popped up from the bottom of the bowl! Yay, lots of them!  BBQ Shrimp Vermicelli looked great too. All food we ordered was very fresh and delicious!  Sorry I had to take 1 star off because they didn't give me basil leaves...It's important when you eat pho. :(
Maybe next time! Hope they will keep the quality because I will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't let the outside of this place fool you! The inside ambiance is actually very pleasant. My boyfriend and I were able to find a booth right as we walked in (which were very comfy I might add). We went on an overcast day and ordered the brisket pho which was very tasty! Some of the meat had a little more fat on it for my taste but that's just me being overly critical. The service was great and the waiters were genuine and very attentive. Without me asking, the waiter came up and poured more pho broth into my bowl so that I wouldn't be left with just noodles, so sweet! I will definitely be coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been here over a dozen times already. This is one of my favorite pho places. Their pho broth is flavorful and never disappoints! Their service is always on point. I crave this place many times but probably go a few times a month when I am around the area. I guess that is considered often for most people. 

Their pho tai chin is my usual at this place and all pho places. I like to ask for onions with vinegar on the side.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their broth is flavorful! What I like most is their beef in the pho; it is exceptionally tender. 

We ordered the BBQ pork for the kids and they loved it. The kids kept telling us how yummy the meat is and they were. Infatuated with the yellow rice. The pork was thin and flavorful, easy for me as a parent to cut it up into bits for the kids. 

I will definitely be back with the family!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I gave this place a rave review initially when I used to live in the area this place with my favorite pho location, Upon returning back I think they may have switched management because I didn't see the owner who was almost always there I felt that their noodles were overcooked and kind of slimey their broth was subpar and their meat quality went down a little bit too. When I first walked in the place kind of smells like roach spray and this sounds extremely offensive but it kind of smelled like urine too, the place didn't smell good at it was a little unappetizing. On a last note their menu is extremely old and because it's not laminated basically about half of the text was worn off it was hard to even place an order because I could barely read the menu<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went here last night and was very disappointed. It is obvious that they changed management and the place has gone downhill. My chicken was rubbery and you could tell it was poor quality. I got food poisoning from the lettuce in my salad. The food is definitely over priced. I will not be going back here. The service was horrible as well. The waiter barely spoke the whole time and when he did I couldn't understand what he was saying. He didn't even know what beer was on the menu. When we got the check, it was hard to read with a bunch of numbers that were unclear. This is the most disgusting Vietnamese food I have ever had.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great portions, great broth, great value. Sooo delicious and they have also have amazing entertainment on occasion! Saw Zeke and Hugh play and it really made our evening that much more enjoyable. Thank you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Pho here is okay. There menu is very authentic and pretty affordable. The restaurant was super clean, and the staff was friendly enough.

Their pork egg rolls were delicious and I had a really good Thai Iced tea, but the pho seemed kind of bland. Since there are so many other pho places in the area idk if I will be going back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Upon arriving I was greeted with a menu and a smile. Then... I was forgotten. I sat there for a while (ignored) until I finally had to flag down one of the servers. He went to go tell another server ( I waited a little more) and they finally took my drink & food order. Yea, I waited for a drink too! 

My food came fairly quickly. I ordered combo B. Fried rice, an egg roll & shrimp pho. First came the fried rice & roll. Shortly after was my pho. The food was delicious. No doubt about that! 

Mediocre to poor service. 

A+ food.

I'll give it another shot... I guess.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My coworker and I came here on a cold and gloomy day...only the most perfect pho weather! Tried their Thai iced tea with boba; bleh so bad - the boba was all soft and mushy. Switched it out for their coconut water which was really good. The fried egg rolls were OK and they charge you an extra dollar for the lettuce...makes no sense because every place I've been includes the lettuce. You're not going to make s PB&J without the two key ingredients so what gives? Lol The soup was actually good...but not the best. I plan on trying some other pho places in the area in the future.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I LOVE this pho spot! My go to when I have to get some studying done. The waiter/waitress are very attentive and they'll let you study as long as you want. I have stayed there for 2 hours, but I always feel weird staying there more than I anticipate so i order egg rolls or Vietnamese coffee (really strong by the way). Quick service, gives more than one limes, freshly washed bean sprout, and get your request right.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">pho taste too salty and too much msg. the waiter not even dont understand what im odered until when i speak vietnamese language ....  no customer service, no said yes or no or thank you, sorry when wrong my order anything.????  just keep using phone like that??? im so sorry, but no tip for you guys....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Pho is good here, but they have been very stingy on the portion lately.  Even for a "Super" size bowl, it's like a regular size everywhere.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Deliciousness in a bowl! Decided to try this place while killing time for a movie, great decision!

I had the seafood pho which hit the spot! I've been craving Pho, and this place was perfect! We also ordered the Olivia Spring rolls, which come with a special "Olivia" sauce. I was hesitant at first, but was quickly debating, which sauce I liked best (peanut sauce or Olivia), Olivia won! 

My son got the BBQ chicken with steamed rice and garlic rice. The garlic rice wasn't too different from the regular steamed rice, but we ate it anyway.

Friendly staff, super attentive! Would come back here again, if I happen to be in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's been 2 years since I have come to this place.
I always felt that this place is overpriced but foods taste good.

the reason why I am giving 2 stars and never going back to this place again is they charged plates for onions I requested.
Over the past years, they never charged extra onions.
This one new guy pointed out that extra onion will be charged 1 dollar from the menus.  didn't know it and never been charged before.
Anyway, price is already expensive than other places and now they starting to charge onions.    Me and my co-worker have decided not to come here.
We will drive littler further to get cheaper and about the same quality food.  (normally other places won't charge onions and their pho usually runs 6~7 dollars....This place average food price is $9~$10.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tasty Pho and friendly server. Everything was so fresh and delicious! Dining area was very clean.  Will definately go back and try other dishes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down the best Pho place in Fullerton. You will not find a more fresh and less oily soup anywhere. This has a Korean's stamp of approval.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You will definitely get your pho fix here if you're desperate. If you're a phonatic like me and grew up eating pho, you'll give this place a 3 star or lower. The portion is pretty big for a large so I should have ordered a small. The broth and meat was not too impressive however. It all tastes like pho... just lacks the love. Where's the love?

My bf ordered the BBQ pork rice under my recommendation cause no place that claims to be vietnamese can mess up that grilled pork with the tasty fish sauce drizzle. And it was not at all disappointing! That is the FOUR STARS :) 

The grilled pork spring rolls was a little thick on the rice paper and it was served with an unfamiliar sauce, something else different added atop from my usual peanut sauce and it was yellowish. It was tasty but i thunk it'd be better off with the peanut sauce itself. [if you had Brodard, your standards for the pork spring rolls will never be the same again]

Lastly, the service was ultimately attentive in the beginning but totally neglected towards the end of our meal. It didn't get particularly busy but we felt kinda forgotten. The waiter was still nice, thanks dude.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pho is mediocre (last couple times I have had too much noodles, and not to mention soggy)... However the combo is $10 includes a small pho, fried rice and chicken, small salad and an egg roll. Good for the price!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Normally I'd go out to Garden Grove to satisfy my pho cravings, but I decided to keep it local this time.

Pho Olivia is nicer than most noodle spots and the service was friendly and helpful which is absolutely non-existent elsewhere. I didn't order pho, but instead ordered a broken rice dish with charbroiled pork and a side of soup, which by the way will cost you an extra dollar.

The portions aren't all that big and it doesn't come with much meat. As far as flavor is concerned, it was definitely tasty. If you're curious if the soup is worth the extra dollar, that's up to you. It was definitely a bigger bowl of soup than usual and was really good.

Pho Olivia's ratings on yelp is better than pretty much all the other places so they're doing something right.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm no Pho expert but this place is good and hits the spot. Friendly staff is a big plus! This is my new go to.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fabulous pho and spring rolls. Cute place. Super clean. Very attentive service. Pho is sweet and mild. I did beef broth cmwith veggies. Nice and fresh veggies. Spice it to your own desire. Tons of tasty options on the menu.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">On a cold day, I was craving a hot bowl of noodle soup for lunch.  It's conveniently close to CSU Fullerton.  The place is tucked in a corner of the shopping center.  I think you can't go wrong with the soup broth for pho and this place make it just perfect.  I had a small bowl of pho with brisket and rare beef.  They put a lot of meat.  The amount of noodle was just the perfect portion.  Service is fast and the staff are friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">(#Vakseen4taste #foodie) We were headed to the Bruery and needed some food to sponge up the high abv goodness we were about to enjoy so we decided to go the "healthy" route. Rustic Spoon is probably my go to spot for pho but I can honestly say Olivia comes in a close #2-3. 

The place was a little warm when we walked in but they quickly turned on the ac without us saying a word. It cooled down within 10-15mim. I'll assume they just opened and were conserving energy. We were greeted by a friendly server that got the ball rolling immediately. We sat and ordered vegetarian egg rolls to start, followed by a large order of pho ga (chicken). The egg rolls took approx 5 min to come out and the pho followed 10 min later.  

The egg rolls were fried perfectly, appearance and taste wise. Perfect crispy  outer shell (crunch when you take a bite) with delicious, perfectly seasoned veggies. The dipping sauce, which seemed like a sweet ponzu, matched the natural veggie flavors perfectly. 

Next, the pho, which was delicious. There's a lime shortage so we received lemons on the side along with the sprouts. I was a little worried or curious at first but they're just as good as the lime. Just a slightly different kick. The pho was very on point. Well seasoned broth (not too salty), onions and tender slices of chicken breast. The rice noodles they use were a little thinner than I'm used to so they kept breaking as I tried to pick them up with my chopsticks but that's nothing a slight hand adjustment couldn't fix. Very good pho!

Great experience and start of the afternoon. I definitely appreciate them having clean bathrooms as well. 

Food 4.5/5
Service 4/5
Ambiance 4/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First thing: their rice dishes and vermicelli bowls are ridiculously overpriced. 
I've been dragged here a few times by my friends, and I've never been too happy.
The flavors are missing something. Maybe they are trying to 'americanize' it and they add less herbs/spices or water down the fish sauce, but all the food is missing some kind of flavor maybe to cater to a certain palate.
The vermicelli bowls also have a horrible vegetable to noodle ratio. Seriously, it's called a vermicelli bowl, not a cucumber and bean sprout bowl. Even when I asked for less bean sprouts, the size of the dish shrunk.
I've never had their pho (because I've only come here on really hot days) but paying almost 13 bucks after tax and tip for a rice or vermicelli noodle dish that is subpar is ridiculous.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A friend and I tried this place on a whim. We both enjoyed it very much! The setting is nice and modern and the food was awesome! I had the chicken pho. The service was nice because the waiters weren't hovering over us constantly and always showed up at the right times, making sure we had drinks and that everything was okay. I will definitely be going back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We've been coming to pho Olivia for awhile but this is the first time I've had time to write a review. The overall decor is really nice. It's not a very large place but the food is very affordable. Considering the close proximity to Cal State Fullerton, majority of the patrons are students.
They have all the traditional vietnamese fare like pho and bbq, rice and combo dishes. Everything from the soup broth to the bbq chicken and pork is delicious. The shrimp rockets are great and I highly recommend their desserts. They had a banana Nutella crepe at one point but I'm not sure if that is a regular menu item. All in all a great hole in the wall for authentic vietnamese food. Plus it's great to avoid driving on to the 57 fwy and 91 during rush hour!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I crave the pho here ALL THE TIME~! I've only been here once (two years ago), but that one time was the BEST PHO EXPERIENCE and it has kept me longing for it ever since.  

The only minor detail that may have distorted my taste buds then was that I was pretty hungover. 

However I must say this, I may not be Vietnamese, but when it comes to ramen or pho, I can be rather picky. I care about the broth and the type of noodle they use to create a balanced, well-rounded experience. I am not one of those people who put lemon grass and hot sauces all over my pho. I like mine simple so I get to know which pho is ACTUALLY GOOD. NOT distorted with bunch of other sides and spices. So if you're looking at those reviews that complain about the broth being bland or whatever, you can probably count on those people to be the one's gouging with everything possible.

Anyway this place did an amazing job to cure my hangover and also created a great eating experience with quality food! The broth is what did it for me. It was oily and fatty which made it very appetizing.

I wish this place was closer to me since I live in irvine. I rarely ever find myself hungover near Fullerton so I have not had my chance to trek back to this place. 

But I am definitely planning on dragging some friends with me so I can experience this place for the 2nd time.

I think I'll add another star once I get my 2nd try :)

EDIT: I GOT TO TRY IT AGAINNNN :D Finally after 2 years! And thankfully it was super yummy. I dont care if I'm not hungover, I am making my trip out to this place whenever I get a chance :) So I just added another star to make it 5 starssss! BTW my friend tried something that wasn't pho. She said it tasted okay. She would give it 3 stars. SO if youre gonna check this place out, GET THE PHO!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A large N-7 (Pho with rare steak and tripe) with hot tea and lemon soda is $14.96.

This is the only pho restaurant I frequent in Fullerton because it's the only restaurant that has the broth down. Some of the surrounding restaurants in Fullerton can be so depressing lol, but Pho Olivia never disappoints. 

The noodles are cooked to perfection -- not too long where they're soggy, and not too short where they're still hard.

Broth is good  and they have side dishes (diced onions picked in vinegar and beef oil). Bean sprouts and basils are always fresh! 

Entrees are a bit smaller than what I'm used to, but it's not a big deal. They have to pay for their lease somehow. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Looking around for a decent pho place in the North OC, I stumbled into Pho Olivia with low expectations.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that the broth here is surprisingly good!  The broth was clean and flavorful (think Mon Ami).  Too bad the prices here are a premium compared to Westminster...but if you need a quick fix, this is your place.

4 stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Walking distance from CSUF. A must hit up spot for all the college students who want 'FO' to hit the spot on a chilly day. Seriously! I suggest reading all the 3 stars and below reviews rather than the higher rated reviews to determine if you really want to eat at Pho Olivia.

God, no. Let me start off by saying, yes the interior is clean, modern, any positive adjective can describe Pho Olivia. Even their bathrooms are freakin' cool. On to the food. I decided on a Pho Tai. Also asked for the bean sprouts and mint leaves to be blanched in warm water before serving. It was told again, but in Vietnamese. Hopefully they got the message, right? In the time it took to go use the restroom and wash hands thoroughly, the pho tai was just brought to the table. Man, that was just too fast. I thought I asked for Pho Tai, which by the way, is rare beef. It should come out still pink and while it's sitting in the broth, the broth will cook it. Mine came out cooked already, completely brown. Vegetables? They were cold, so they didn't do what we politely asked them to do. That came out so fast. Way. Too. Fast. 

-The broth was disappointing. Very bland and lacked any flavor. Sadly, towards the end, I had to douse it with hot sauce and chilli pastes.

+The Noodles were awesome. It was soft and delicate. Good amount of it too. 

I like clean restaurants. Especially when I'm dining in Asian restaurants. But, it doesn't even matter when the pho is no where near the quality of the interior itself.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Favorite place to go when I am in the Fullerton area around CSUF. I usually get the brisket pho.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I wanted some pho and yelp led me here. Overall the chicken pho was average. Its all about the broth, and this one wasn't anything special. The side veggies was basal, brussel sprouts, and lemon, no jalapeños :(. I like places that also offer soy sauce in addition to chili, siracha, and the Vietnamese special sauce. The price is a little more expensive then most places by about a dollar. My large chicken pho was $9.67 after tax. No credit card limit, service was prompt, restaurant was clean.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was debating between 3 or 4 stars for this place and settled with 3. 

I do really enjoy the pho here - the noodles and quality and the broth is great. I really like how the menu has a good variety of options. Bonus points for how quick the service is here!

However, I only gave it three starts because I feel I sick after I eat here. I'm usually exceptionally thirsty after I eat any pho place, but I don't normally feel nauseous and dizzy like I do after eating here. It's probably just a personal reaction I have to something in the food and not their fault, but it does keep me from coming back.

If I didn't feel so sick after eating here, I would come more often!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, and the prices are fair. What more could one ask for?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It was decent. Portions were smaller than normal tho. Then at the same time, I eat too much. That's why I have this annoying fat around my stomach that never leaves me. Anyways I think this place was tasty with a mediocre service. But much better places exist. But not disappointing! Enjoy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">nice atmosphere and awesome live music! the food and service were good<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yes it is 5 star good. Super service.  Very clean. Try it. You wont be sorry. 

If you dont understand the menu they will help you. I usually do not eat desert but sure glad I did. 

You can tell you are eating fresh food and not pre-package from the local vendor.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Above average prices of Vietnamese food.  Mostly paying for the prettiness of the food and restaurant. The egg rolls I had were extremely crunchy. Very fried not the usual egg roll. The small pho is $8 and 4 eggrolls is ~$6<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very pleased with the service. Nice and friendly. Clean. We have only had the spring rolls and chicken pho, both were great. 
Parking is a bit of an issue. On the positive side, you can run in to the 99cent store for some quick shopping while you are there. I tend to favor small businesses over larger chain restaurants. These people are going to see us more often. Good job.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So maybe the food at this place is great but I guess I will never know. Five of us went in for dinner and waited 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence, then we watched the staff take the orders of the two Vietnamese families who walked in 10 to 15 minutes after us. At that point we walked out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Normally come here for a quick togo hot bowl of pho when it's rainy or chilly outside. It tastes good and for the price around this area it's not that bad either. There are other places a bit further away that have larger portions and slightly cheaper. But, I'll still come here when I don't want to make the drive.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decorations are nice but food is ok.. Shrimp spring rolls were good. The soup broth was really bland... So disappointed from the reviews :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Such a cute pho spot! 

I didn't think Fullerton had any good Vietnamese restaurants.
I took a shot at checking on Yelp and found this spot.  It's hidden in the corner of a shopping plaza.
It's so nicely decorated, clean, and cozy.  They played blues music when I was there which was very enjoyable.
We had some questions about the menu and the owner came out to talk to us about the dishes.  She was such a sweet young lady, very genuine and went around chatting with all her customers.  I really respect that.  You can tell many customers were regulars because they knew her by name.
The pho was very authentic, and my friend ordered a fish curry rice dish that was delicious.  

They just didn't have some other Vietnamese food items and beverages, but the owner said it's because they serve to a wide selection of non-Vietnamese customers.  I'm just happy that just because they don't cater to many Vietnamese people, they did not stray from the real taste of traditional dishes. 

Give this place a try!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Paid multiple visits to Pho Olivia. I do love it. It's convenient to home and food is always yummy. I'll be back for sure!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I eat here at least twice a week during my lunch break. The pho is pretty good and the portions are generous. I'm surprised to see mixed reviews. I've only had good experiences here but I always wonder why it's fairly empty all the time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I never write a review but when I do it's most important to me. 

This restaurant is horrible from top to bottom. From the moment you walk in, to the moment you leave. The review following are points that support my claim this restaurant is horrible. 

1) Walked in waited 3-4 minutes to be noticed, greeted, and sat at a table.

2) lighting is poor, so poor the customers are squinting and requesting the lights to be brightened. 

3) We ordered then waited 15-20 minutes for the appetizer. ......an appetizer. I had to raise my hand and wave it side to side in order to be noticed so that our food can be brought out.

4) I then asked for our pho to be brought out immediately. After the initial request it took another 15 minutes for our pho to be brought to our table. 
* this means it took an estimated 30 minutes for our pho to get into our mouths. And by pho standards that is an  extremely way too long of a wait.  

5) worse part about this entire situation is the manager/owner was sitting 2 tables over with family/friends just chatting away not noticing there are any issues in the establishment. When I brought up the multiple issues surrounding our experience all she could offer were apologies, and the explanation of people wanting a relaxing environment and enjoy dinner. *enjoy what dinner? It hasn't even been brought out. 

6) the restaurant was empty with 3 other parties in the establishment. So any thoughts that the service was poor because they were busy cannot be used. 

In conclusion this establishment has horrible service for mediocre food. Do not go to this place if you are expecting a fast (normal) served pho restaurant because that is not what you will receive. You receive a friendlier environment at any other food restaurant, even an IKEA, or fresh n easy. 

My goal isn't to have you avoid this restaurant but more for the ownership and management to take accountability and to improve on what should be a great restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pho sure! Pho is always good on a rainy day. Service is slow and broth is OK. 
TIP: Ask for everything you need at once as you won't see the server until you give the check, also FYI~ There will be days where you get more noodles and days more soup with noodles.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm going keep it simple !
The place looks very nice and the people that work here are very polite and offer a great service, but there is one thing that make me rate this nice place with one star and it's the flavor of the pho it's just works than an instant Maruchan soup!!!
 For the price I paid here I could go to Pho 45 at Garden Grove (excellent place) and eat twice and with a real pho taste.
Guys you got a nice place here just find better cooks!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I do not like to give bad reviews, but the manager was so rude to meet when I went in to this place for a to go order. Most Vietnamese restaurants have bad customer service, but this experience was exceptional. I walked out and went to Maru Sushi, who made my night much better after my experience here. I sincerely hope your experience is better. I guess she does not see me as a regular, so she did not care.
Maybe, I will not be back. Who knows what she would do to my food, because I walked out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered the small brisket pho w side of veggies: 
Service was nice and quick,
Atmosphere was odd for a pho place, 
Broth sucked. Lacking flavor.
My side of veggies tasted old and cost $2! 
The basil that comes w bean sprouts was terribly old, rubbery, and elastic. And no jalapeño on that plate either. 
My brisket was overdone and dry. 

Most likely not coming back here. Too pricey for sub-par pho. 

Sorry not sorry.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Review for lunch combo 1:

The fried rice was bland. It tasted like eggs and white rice. No flavor.

Rare beef and brisket pho had decent broth and meat, but both tasted like something was missing. The noodles were also chewy. Blech.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pho here has nothing on the pho restaurants in Lil' Saigon =) (3/5)

The broth is much too clear & not as hearty as Little Saigon Pho.

They gave very small amounts of meat in the Pho here. -1

Rice vermicelli  w/ grilled shrimps: (3/5)
Very small amounts of shrimps & veggies here as well, fish sauce was very light as well.

Service: A

Decor: Nice & comfy : B

Overall, very Americanized place that serves decent Pho but not as authentic as you'd find in Little Saigon area in the heart of Westminster.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It wasn't very good.  The pho was average and the crispy spring rolls were not great.  They were edible but not something I would ever come back for.  I probably should have gone to the thai place next door.  
The restaurant was clean but the food wasn't good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just finished my dinner here and had to go on yelp to say how happy I was with my appetizer (crepe), boyfriend had the Olivia pho with extra veggies (meat was super tender and marinated), and I had the lemon grass meat vermecilli (super flavorful that I didn't need to use the fish sauce). Will definitely come back!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm not really a huge fan of Vietnamese food but I really enjoy the food at Pho Olivia.  I am a vegetarian so I order the VV-5 every single time because it's so good!  Veggie egg rolls with vermicelli noodles.  The bf is a huge fan of their tendon also.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Its good for american style catered to ameeicans, but not straight authentic, too bland for a vietnamese person....i gave them a three star for food and  five star for good service and cleanliness.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Clean, friendly service, good PHO.
I like the rare beef PHO the best. It's so tender and they'll get cooked with the heat of the soup so you don't need to be worried. I eat here every once in a while.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered their vermicelli noodle dish which was topped with BBQ pork and some eggrolls -- delicious as always! If only they give you more noodles though. It felt like majority of the bowl was packed with lettuce and vegetables.

My one gripe about this place though is the fact that they play Adele - over and over and over and over again. I've noticed this other times I've been to Pho Olivia. I was a fan of her music when she released her album "21," but the popularity of her and her music has really killed it for me for the past year. So it's incredibly annoying hearing how much her songs are played, and it bothered me like no other having to hear her music at a restaurant as well... they could at least play KOST 103.5 or something where there's a better variety of music.

Makes no sense that I complain about their choice of music here, but I come here to relax and unwind; and it's rather tough when they play some REALLY overrated and overplayed music. Just sayin'.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Somehow, I ended up paying $15 for a large bowl of Pho and a pot of tea. The others ended up paying $12 for the same. There were four of us.

Overpriced! Nothing special about the food here and the small bowl of Pho is tiny compared to the small or regular sized bowls at other nearby Pho houses.

This is Pho! I'm not here to pay a little extra for the fancier dining ware, tea pots, the soothing background music and ambiance. I always feel I pay too much and get too little food at this place and their sister restaurant, Olivia's Bistro in La Habra. Lunch here the other day will also be my last!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for the first time after reading reviews here on Yelp. I work in the area and not too familiar with the area.
I must say I was pleasantly surprised how wonderful the Pho was. I had the Olivia Spring Rolls - simple and excellent.
I will be coming back.
The place is very nicely decorated and the servers are nice and friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious pho. We ordered the vegetable eggrolls, a Pho Olivia (meatball and rare beef), and vegetarian pho. 

Pros:
- Eggrolls were freshly fried and delicious
- Servings were generous and super affordable

Cons:
- Needed more onions and scallions, but the side veggies were just bean sprouts, basil, and lime
- I thought the beef broth was a little mild (I like more cinnamon and anise)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very potential place to regular! 
While their food is not BLOW ME AWAY DELICIOUS. It's pretty good, and the people here are very attentive and the food is WELL PRICED.

Really affordable yummy food, with great service? I'm down!
I'd like to try the rest of their menu as they have a pretty traditional Vietnamese Menu.

Their ice coffee ain't half bad either! (;<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've eaten here many times and was always treated nicely.  I'm no expert in Vietnamese food, but I like broth soups and pho is what I come for.  In other places broth feels heavy or oily, but here it's just right. 
Try Olivia Spring Rolls.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Terrible customer service. Closing time is 9:00 PM and last call is at 8:45. When we walk in at 8:35 to order food, we are told "last call is at 8:45.... but ummmm yeah. We are closed" 

What. Don't make a last call policy if you are not going to follow it. :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I called ahead to ask if they had veggie broth and they assured me they did!  I go in and ordered a veggie pho with veggie broth out comes a beautiful bowl loaded with vegies however after one taste I could taste the beef broth!  I called the waiter over and he says he was going to ask the cook?? he comes back and says it's veggie I said it's not I can taste the beef and so he says well what do you want me to do?  I asked for the bill and PAID and left.  Please don't insult my intelligence and tell me that it's veggie when clearly it was NOT then have me pay for it.  Never will go back again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really wanted to like this place. It is within walking distance to my house and I love pho. I've gone to the restaurant several times before and although it isn't the best pho (not even close), I kept going back...it was super convenient, what can I say?

Today's experience turned me off to any future visits, no matter how much I crave pho and no matter how easy it is to just walk down the street to get there.

First, I walked in and they didn't say hi or anything. This is kind of a common occurrence, and so I walked over to the counter. They finally saw me and I asked if I can sit down. They nodded and since I always order pho chin, I already knew what I wanted and ordered right away. I was starving and thirsty due to the heat. 

The waiter placed the water on the table and I immediately took a large gulp--and the water was super salty!! I had to spit it out onto a napkin (it was disgusting!!!) and I walked over to grab more napkins. I told the waiter that the water was salty and he brought over another water and apologized. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for the whole meal--it was a very strong salty taste--but I didn't think that he did it on purpose, so I told him it was ok. I took a tentative sip of the new glass of water he brought me and it tasted like soap. :(

When the food came out, I ate the pho really fast. Although my mouth was still covered in salt, I was hungry. When the bill came out, I gave him $8.01 (the bill was for $7.51), since I didn't have exact change. He took the bill and I waited for him to give me change back. I waited for about 15 minutes (there was only one other table seated in the restaurant...not busy at all). I thought maybe they were being polite, so I walked up to the counter and asked if I could have my change. Instead of grabbing my check with the change I assumed was already waiting for me inside (there was no check in sight), the waiter opens the register and grabs the change he owes me--he knew exactly how much he owed me, which meant he had already processed the bill and purposely chose not to give me change back--and gives it to me...

The only explanation I could come up with is that he assumed that was his tip. Why would I tip him only $.50? Why didn't he ask if I wanted change back instead of just pocketing the change? I was originally going to tip, but I ended up just walking out of there, feeling insulted and appalled at his lack of manners...

Good bye forever, Pho Olivia.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good but not the best I've had. Atmosphere was nice, casual, good vibes, but no chili oil for the pho? Really?  The flavor wasn't good enough for me to drink the broth although it wasn't bad either.   Overall I would say it is good and I will go back if I'm in the area but wouldn't make a special trip.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">SO GOOD. I always start with their Olivia spring rolls because they're so amazing!! Then onto the pho bowl with rare brisket and flank. Everything about it is delicious! The broth, the noodles, the meat, everything!! Yum, yum, yum.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went here today for lunch and this could be my new favorite French Vietnamese restaurant. This place reminds me of a restaurant in Oakland which I used to eat at regularly called Le Cheval's. 

My honey and I ordered the rocket shrimp, fried butter garlic chicken wings, two 33 export beers and pho. 

It hit the spot and I'm definitely coming back again. The service is friendly and prompt. The decor and ambiance is a bit modern, contemporary and very clean.  Thanks to yelp.com for the recommendation and high ratings. The food speaks for itself. This place is about 10 mins from our spot so we are glad that we can go here than heading to our other fave spot, Pho Crystal in Costa Mesa.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really appreciate the authenticious pho here. STORY TIME.

So Olivia is the one who inspired the two sisters to create a pho restaurant. So the one in La habra on Imperial highway, is related to the Pho Olivia here on chapman ave. Interesting HUH.

Also, I learned some vietnamese today from the workers here. 

the broth was straight up vietnamese style. IF you had homemade vietnamese pho, this restaurant has probably a similar taste to that. What can I say, I do not like the fusion pho that my native tongue Korean people have done with Pho. Sorry : ( 

Good for smaller groups, and they have lunch specials for less than 10 dollars which includes small pho, fried rice, and egg roll. Yum.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am a Vietnamese Student straight from Vietnam and I love this place. While the food here cannot be traditional, they're pretty damn close. I've had the chance to try many dishes and if you are, like me, straight from Vietnam and missing some flavors from home, try the shaken beef ! It's the closest thing you can get and it's brilliant !

The loss of 1 star is because of the fact that the Pho here is not pho at all, not even close. It's closer to what you would call a Hu Tieu. For a place that has Pho in their name, their "Pho" is disappointing to me just because it's not what it should be.

But overall everything else is great ! I would definitely go again for that shaken beef ! Super delicious !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came to eat here with my boyfriend because we were in the area. We both got the pho tai and it was pretty good. Chewy noodles, tender meat, and flavorful broth. Thai iced tea is really good too-slightly sweeter than other places. Music and decor is nice as well. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We got the pho tai.. it had meatballs which was unusual. We also got fried rice with chicken which was really good. The pho was ok. But the broth, which makes or breaks a pho was not great. Definitely had better. Oh, and the raw meat that they put in the broth, was tenderized and marinated, but so awful and raw tasting when you ate it. I am not really a meat fan, but love it in pho because it adds so much flavor to the broth. This time, no. It tasted like raw carcass. It was just doing way too much. Which is a bummer because I really wanted to like this place. The broth tho, just not where I wanted it to be. HOWEVER, the fried rice and chicken was delicious. So if you are going for the meals other than pho, this is a good place! (so hard to find a good pho and rice and pork meal restaurant).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came back with a friend and received great service again. (Thanks, Deyson!)

Last time, my complaint last time was the rare meat being over-cooked. This time, however, things were perfect! Rare beef came on the side and I was able to cook it myself and control the rarity level.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I want to start of by saying that this place was good when I first started going there. Idk if they got a new cook or changed the recipe but it's awful now. The flavor is gone, the vegetables are welted, the meat portions have gotten smaller and taste chewy, and the noodles were stuck together because they were over cooked. Truly shocking in how much the food has changed here. Not coming here anymore.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just enjoyed the Vietnamese Crepe and olivia rolls. If I lived next door i'd have these everyday. The crepe was amazing. My booth was open. Service was excellent as always. 
Haven't been dissapointed since I've been coming here. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Here's the rundown:

Not your usual to-go hole in the wall pho shop here. This small restaurant is tucked away in the corner of the 99cent & bofa plaza. Parking is spacious, perhaps busy on the weekends

- The interior is very modern, hippy, and trendy. Kudos for that
-Service was great. Our waiter was really sweet and accommodating. 
- Prices are fair
-The bun thit nuong ( rice noodles ) was really good. 

However, the pho broth wasn't that flavourful as i expected from the reviews. It tasted watered down as if they just filled the pot with water when it was running low. Didn't taste the spices or that hint of pork bones.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My wife and I came here last Friday evening for dinner. It's hidden in a corner of a shopping plaza. It looked tiny from the outside but was actually airy and quite roomy. The interior was actually upscale compared to regular Pho joints. It was clean and comfortable. 

They offered a special summer combo menu. I chose combo A which included a fried egg roll, salad, chicken fried rice and a small Pho for $9.95. I chose their Pho with rare beef and brisket. The egg roll and salad came out first. The egg roll was perfectly fried with a meaty center. The salad was just lettuce with a light, slightly sweet dressing. The chicken fried rice came out next. It was pretty bland but sriracha sauce transformed it significantly.  The Pho was excellent. The broth was light yet refreshingly deep. The noodles were perfect. There was enough beef to satisfy me. 
My wife ordered their veggie Pho combo which includes salad, spring rolls, soda and a large bowl of veggie Pho for $12.99. The spring rolls were pretty bland and needed hot sauce to transform it as well. She really enjoyed her Pho as well.

Service was excellent as the servers came by our table frequently. Overall, I think we got a steal for all the food we got. The interior was upscale and clean and service was great. Recommended!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been going to this place for a while and my most recent visit was horrible, last time I'm going to this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service: great
Music: good 
Cleanliness: excellent 
Food: mediocre

I got a pho dac biet and it was okay. Broth was plain had to season with a lot of hoison and sriracha. Had a lot of noodles and a little amount of meat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was really surprised at how good the pho here was.  Good flavor to the broth and quick service.  If you are looking for a complex artisanal broth, this probably is not the place for you.  It is just simple straightforward pho.  Quality of the meats used in their pho is on the better side compared to most places and explains the cost.   Most of the other pho places that I have been to has a diluted, watered down broth, but not here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Honestly, I don't understand the many reviews and high rating of this place. Not saying my experience here was horrible, it was good actually. But for the actual flavor of the food...ehh. This place deserves a spot on 3. 

Interior decor was nice and clean. 

Service was friendly and quick! 

Food...now listen up. 

I like to eat my pho plain and simple--to really taste all the flavors. The noodles were soft, but had a few clumps here and there. I didn't mind that really. Meat was slightly thicker than other pho places I've been to, so that was a plus. 

But...the broth....the broth...hmm. It was missing a certain flavor that other pho places had. Maybe it was lacking a bit of sweetness? Or didn't have enough spices? I'm not sure. But it didn't really hit the spot for me. 

It's an average pho place. Not bad. Not amazing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food for a good price.  Family of 4 ate for just under $40.  We will come back here for sure<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came back with a different friend and this time we ordered a number 1. No veggies or anything like that.

And what do you know? No crazy broccoli like last time when one of my other friends wanted vegetables added to her soup and everybody ended up with veggie broth.

Anyhoo this time it was a lot better. However it wasn't mind blowing or anything. Just a nice solid bowl of pho.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">2 small bowls of pho and 2 hot tea was 19 dollars and something cents.  Expensive for pho.  Noodles were precooked.  I like mine kinda al dente.  The broth was ok, slightly bland for my taste.  

The Restaurant has a nice ambiance.  Nothing special to write home about.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is OK, ate her last week and was really unimpressed with there Tom Yum.  It was not very spicy and they did not ask me how hot I wanted it. The flavor kind of lacked from other Tom Yum soups I have tried.

 I've eaten here before and it was better, so was the service. There is a man who works there (think his sister owns it) and he was awesome. Last visit it was two women who seemed not very interested it what they were doing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been coming here for a few years and it has just been getting better over the recent years! My go to place at least twice a week! Wonderful people and pho!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yeah, it's one of the better pho joints in my neighborhood but I think I still prefer Pho Lover over Pho Olivia.

I've been to their other location in La Habra so I pretty much knew what to expect. The prices and portions aren't that great, as I thought the large which costs more than other places wasn't that big and I wasn't fully satisfied. Taste-wise, things were good except that there was a lack of cilantro in my bowl of pho; it was either non-existent or there was very little of it. I'm not sure if that was the standard or if they ran out of cilantro...

I first sat at the booth and noticed something really disgusting on the bench. There is a small gap between the leather seat and the wooden frame it sits in. In this gap was all sorts of nasty food and trash particles that probably hasn't been cleaned out in god knows how long. It was so disgusting I ended up moving to another (non-booth) table. If you sit in the booths, don't look down at the bench because you will lose your appetite! I'm gonna have to deduct a star for that...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I gave this place another chance, because unfortunately it is the closest pho to where I live at an I love Vietnamese food so much. So this time, I get a vegetarian pho, and first I see a tiny fly on my vegetable (looked like a gnat easily mistaken for a black speck). I took it out, and kept on eating, and I found a piece of meat with fat on it inside my soup. I told the waiter he offered to make another one, but like I said before, customer service SUCKS. They thought they were going to charge me for their mistake. 

No wonder why this place is always empty with only a few customers at a time. Their customer service is POOR.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Loved this place... until today. Have been going here with my roommates for over a year now at least once every two weeks. Once a while back my roommate found a tiny fly in her soup and they replaced it with another one that also had a tiny fly. She took a couple months rest and decided to go back.

Today I ordered two SUPER vegetarian phos to go. When I got home my roommate and I opened our phos and started eating. It wasn't until half way threw mine that I looked down and saw a BUNCH of tiny little bugs in my pho! Not just three... or 5... or 10.... but a crap ton! They were so little they almost looked like broccoli fibers!

Needless to say after being loyal customers and spending $22 dollars today plus tip... we are NEVER GOING BACK!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for the first time and I loved it!

Very clean and very friendly staff 

Didn't wait long for the food and the food was so flavorful. 

The spring special for dinner is perfect !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is place has my FAV-OR-ITE PHO!!  

I try to eat mostly vegetarian, well with some fish, ok I am flexible about it....I guess I am more of a flexitarian.  Anyway, their veggie broth is delicious and what really makes their veggie pho stand out is that they grill the tofu before just plopping it in. It is delicous. I can't get enough.

They serve other things that my family says are good but since I am slightly obsessed with their veggie pho, that is really all I can speak to.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A little overpriced in comparison with other Pho houses in the area, but the ambiance and the service make up for it in my opinion!

Everything is pretty standard, though my boyfriend was really excited about the fact that they had a few more kinds of pho than most places.  I on the other hand am a creature of character and refuse to touch anything other than the brisket, which had a great (not overly salty) broth!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Had my first vegetarian pho here, and it has become my favorite pho place. The broth is good and has a very clean aftertaste. The ambiance is nice too--cozy with soothing lighting and quiet. I think it seems more so due to the dark interior, which looks classy. The menu is easy to read, the pricing is great, the service is great, and the manager/owner is very professional. I also was very impressed with their Olivia Spring Roll.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pho for days!!! It's so much food!! The broth was probably the best broth I've had for Pho!! It's my go to Pho place officially! Parking is easy, its located in a great shopping center! The best part was when I was there last they gave all of us in the restaurant a small cup of free Thai Iced tea with boba! It was kind of like a dream come true! Perfect for a gloomy day!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow, I'm not wanting to write this review because I was so looking forward to eating here.  The reviews on Yelp were pretty good.  But what a disappointment.  First we ordered the shrimp spring roll.  Every other Pho restaurant we've been to, the shrimp roll included the BBQ pork. This did not and the shrimp had no flavor to it at all.  The rice paper they used was thick and chewy.  Okay, use the peanut sauce, you say?  If it wasn't for the chopped up pieces of peanuts in the peanut sauce, I would have thought this was some type of RUE.  It had the same consistency and that uncooked flour taste.  My son who eats spring rolls like no tomorrow, took one bite and didn't want to continue.  "Mom, I don't like this."

When the Pho came I was hoping for something that would change my mind.  First, the accompaniments were spare.  Basil, bean sprouts and lime.  I'm used to also having cilantro, culantro and jalapeno.  Am I just spoiled from Pho 79? I ordered the N1. Pho dac biet - rare beef, brisket, tendon and tripe.  I asked them to hold the brisket and add more tripe...yes, no extra tripe unless you count 5 strips of tripe as extra.  I'm a tripe fan, what can I say?

Okay, okay there was one great thing.  Make it two - thus the three stars and not the two I was going to throw out. The rare beef melted...just melted in my mouth!  Most other places, it's pretty darn chewy and not rare at all.  Here, the beef was fantastic.  I also ordered the young coconut juice.  Half the pleasure was sucking the coconut flesh through the straw!  Lol. I'm used to scooping it straight from the coconut, but this much more fun, less the work!  But at $2.95, a little pricey.  

The atmosphere was trendy and modern.  The staff warm and friendly.  But really, I should only rate this place for the food.  I'd give a hole in the wall a 5 star if the food was fantastic, so atmosphere and decor will not count on this rating.  

I'd be willing to try again, except I can get better spring rolls and same quality pho for much cheaper (ahem, Pho 79) Two small pho, 1 order spring rolls, 2 drinks = $22.41 before tip.  {sigh}<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We went to Pho Olivia on a Fri evening as both of us were craving something warm on a cool "winter" evening. Although it was not very crowded, it took a while for the server to take our order.  There were all the usual choices for Pho, but we both settled on a large bowl of a variety of beef.  We also ordered Spring Rolls as an appetizer.   The sping rolls were very fresh and light and were a nice start to the meal.  The Pho was not quite as good as I had expected from reading the reviews, but it was still satisfying and moderately priced.  Overall, it was still a good option...atmosphere and food were good, but I wish the service would have been a little more attentive.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow didn't expect much getting Pho in Fullerton.  I always think I need to drive to Garden Grove for some decent Pho.  Too bad discovered this place a little too late, the Yelp community did not over-hyped this place at all.  Great Pho and the price was pretty good, my friend paid for it so I forgot how much it cost.  For sure to come check it out.  

One mroe thing they got 3sizes small large and Super Bowl.  Ordered the large and wasn't that much, so get the Super Bowl if you are hungry and you know you can eat a lot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sometimes you just need food to make a day better. I've been coming to Pho Olivia fairly often, mainly because of it's location. I do miss the jalapeño and limes other pho places usually have, but I'll usually settle for the lemon they provide. 

Now the last time I went there, it was the usual experience. Yes, the interior seems clean and what not. Food, decent. I didn't really want meat this time so I got the pho with veggies and tofu. The carrot slices kind of tasted like soap, no big deal. Just took them out of my soup. 

I go for another bite of noodles only to find a bug hanging out in there. It's a pretty good sized fruit fly that just spoiled my appetite. It also spoiled my friend's appetite. It made us question whether the facilities are actually clean where the eye can't see. I was offered another bowl, but just didn't wanna come across another bug in my soup. I was looking forward to a good meal. 

Since I refused the offer and it was obvious we both didn't even get through half our bowl of soup before the bug appeared, I would've thought, at the very least, a dish would have been compensated for the incident. Nope. Charged full price for food we barely ate for something they had control over. Or Maybe they didn't have control over bugs in their kitchen, but they did have control on customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have to agree with people who liked the interior/decor....but when it comes to the taste...I just have to give 3. Broth was so plain with almost no flavor. I don't usually put a dark sauce in my Pho, but I had to. Noodles had a slight odor that the noodles weren't fresh (semi fresh) noodles. If I am not mistaken, those were dried from a package. Dried noodles bring a certain odor that can't blend in a soup well, unless a soup has stronger flavor to stand out. 

The price was almost $1 more than many places in Little Saigon. Considering the area where has almost no competions, this is actually not a bad deal, then again, the quality of food was not up to a standard. 

I think, I will pass this place next time when I am in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The restaurant has a warm, welcoming ambiance. I was dining by myself, and it felt super comfortable. It was a cold Sunday night, and they were busy. I was a waiter myself and both servers did an amazing job tending the dining room and taking care of the customers. I'm a vegetarian, and it was my first time there. The young man recommended few item based on what I felt like having; the vegy roll, vegetarian Pho w/ tofu, fresh young coconut water and a Nutella banana crepe for desert. It was an amazing meal, and I highly recommend the place. Since I don't have any kids, I guess I need to build some tolerance for kids' temper tantrums. The dining room is small and if a kid decides he/she is not happy, you'll definitely know about it. Overall it was nothing to ruin the wonderful dinner. Try it for yourself.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This pho spot is one out of two of my favorites! I usually get a small pho brisket with young coconut juice. The portions are actually big for the small option! Or at least in my opinion. The broth is very flavorful as well. I recommend coming here if you're hung over or if you just want a good bowl of pho :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I give them five stars because they deserve it. While trying to find a good pho place I didn't see anyone with 5 stars, so if your looking for a great place, look no further. Yes the broth is hot and delicious and yes the spring rolls are fresh. I personally had the garlic egg noodles and chicken and it made my day! Thought I was getting sick and well you know what the wonders of garlic and pho can do....also super cute teapot for the table and honey too! It was all soooo good. To top it off excellent service, nice CLEAN environment. It wasn't too busy when we went but I definitely recommend this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A little pricey, but this place is so good. The broth is delicious, the noodles are cooked to perfection and the meat is so tender. What's awesome is that if you order take out, they give you a plastic bowl for your pho. Love this place. And the egg rolls are good too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service here. The waiter is always friendly and super nice. The pho is excellent and I try to come here about twice a month. Some of the best pho around.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually won't rate a restaurant after a single visit but I was rather perplexed by this one. With this many reviews and 4 stars, I expected more.

I'll start with the positive. The place is clean, servers are friendly, and food came out reasonably quickly. The spring rolls and egg rolls were both good.

However, I came here for pho, and although I'm not expert, I've had pho enough times to know that this place was overpriced and underflavored. The large size is a normal size anywhere else and didn't have as much meat as I was hoping, and the super was marginally bigger. Don't get me wrong, that's enough food, but not so big to justify the high prices ($7 for small, which really is small; $8 for large, and $10 for super). In fact, I've never seen a pho place charge that much.

Back to the actual pho. Noodles were all in a clump at the bottom, which isn't uncommon, but again isn't great. The broth was very mildly flavored, to put it nicely, and ultimately I had to add some sauce.

I hope it was an off day, and that the other reviewers are right. Unfortunately, I won't be trying again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Some of the best pho around. No need to go to Little Saigon for good pho anymore!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always great to find authentic Vietnamese food. I was here after the lunch rush. Greeted with a friendly smile is always a pleasant experience. You'll find Olivia is doing just fine. 
The spring rolls were fresh and very tasty. The Pho outstanding with plenty of condiments. The spice was hot and ready to go. The service was prompt and courteous. 
This time was just me by my lonesome self. Since I work from home, I needed to come out of the cave. I will certainly be bringing my sweetheart wife of 14 years with me next time to enjoy the atmosphere and some great Pho.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came to Pho Olivia again for the first time in months and dinner was delicious!! The staff here is always cordial and the meal always comes out within minutes. The Thai tea is great and the pho here is consistently good (though for some reason tonight it was exceptionally amazing). I had to update my review because this place definitely deserves the extra star. I still maintain my adoration for Pho House but Pho Olivia is, in my opinion, a close 2nd for the best pho in N.OC.... And one of only a handful of pho joints that give you the dinner-restaurant feel, which is lovely =]<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nice ambience. Great service. Clean bathrooms. The pho is watered down. No wonder why California is in a drought. Late.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sorry to say but this place sucks. The pho is absolutely bland. I went there based on the 4 start reviews despite the fact that there were quite a few negative reviews. I wish I would have listened to the warnings! I got veggie and tofu pho and there wasn't enough sauce in the world that would make it have flavor. I'm also not a big fan of salt so if I say it's bland then that's a huge warning sign! I also got the egg rolls which were pretty good but for a Pho place the pho is not worth it since I paid $16 for them both. I have a ton of leftovers.. Disappointed!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">meh. overpriced  and ok tasting pho.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had the Olivia Pho 1/2 noodle it was amazing. I'll definitely be coming back. I ordered the small bowl and it was really filling.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Never judge a book by its cover. Fancy interior contradicts the dingy outer appearance. 

Live music was performed by the server during our entire meal- I never experienced live entertainment while eating pho before.  The service was excellent and welcoming. 

Pho: the flavor of the broth was not oily, rich and tasty- even the small bowl of pho was very filling. We also ordered the v6 on the menu: crispy eggrolls & BBQ pork over rice vermicelli and vegetables. This dish was mediocre, not too flavorful. Prices were quite high for pho- large bowl of pho was about $10. 

Overall a great experience. Will return for their lunch special (M-F $5.99) which priced more reasonably.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can never go wrong with their spring rolls and shrimp rockets. A1 /A2. Good flavor good food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What the pho?! This place is amazing! It looks like a hole in the wall, but don't underestimate it. The pho here's amazing. Not to mention the friendly service. The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because of the price. A large is $8 which is pretty pricey for pho. But definitely will come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What a pleasant looking Pho restaurant. The ones I usually go to are pretty run down. This one was very clean and very welcoming. One of the best looking Pho spots I've been to. The service here is excellent. They had a band playing the entire evening. Even the owner was on the violin showing off his amazing skills. I had such a great time here.

The food itself was really good. The pho bowl wasn't overly fatty and the filet mignon beef melted in my mouth. This was a clean bowl of pho. The fried rice bo luc lac was so good. I don't think very many places serve that special dish. I also had the garlic buttered chicken wings. Those things were so good. You can't go wrong with that dish. Fullerton's got a awesome Pho place in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place. I always get the large beef brisket -very nice, chill ambience, dim lighting and the staff working there are super nice!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time here was for dinner with the girls from work.  I was impressed at the nice decor and cleanliness of the restaurant.  Nikki and I had the pho with shrimp...delicious.  Gracie had the vegetarian pho and really enjoyed it.  Lisa had the garlic noodles with chicken and also enjoyed it.  The veg spring rolls are also very delicious.  Since then I've been ordering pho to-go from here often...esp when I'm not feeling too great.  The owners are really sweet and the service is quick.  I've also had the pho with rare beef and pho with marinated beef.  both are delicious!  Yum yum in my tum!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm from Huntington Beach but moved to Fullerton for college. That being said, I know my Pho because I live somewhat close to Westminster/Garden Grove. if anyone ever consumed Pho in these two cities then you know the Pho is real authentic due to the heavy Vietnamese population living there. 

Pho Olivia is pretty good! I'm not the type of person who soak my broth with hot sauces and lemongrass! The only thing I put in my Pho is a little bit of lime juice after I taste the broth. The broth is perfect. It isn't bland at all according to the other reviews. The noodles aren't too thick and it isn't too thin, just perfect. Perfect place to go when you had a night of partying. 

The service here is fast. Since the restaurant seatings are very open, the staff can see everyone. They are very attentive when it comes to refilling water and getting you check out. Overall, probably the best place for Pho in Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yelp it!
This ain't no dirty
They have clean rating
This is Pho Olivia!

"All I wanna do is take you out on a date tonight!"
Says my wifey to me out of nowhere
I'm gonna take you to a place where I know you're gonna like
And I'm not gonna tell you what it is until we get there
So she's drivin' in our car and my excitement's really building
And she pulls up to this place that's Vietnamese!
I know that she hates to eat Vietnamese food
But tonight my taste buds she wants to please
We enter this place, and wow! I can't believe it
The most swanky Viet restaurant I've been to in my life
I look at the menu, the options seem so good
But tonight I say this to my wife...

"All I wanna do is have some pho!"
But I got a gotta feeling I gotta eat much mo'
All I wanna do is have some pho
But the best things they have there are dry bun noodles and luc lac bo
All I wanna do is have some pho
Warming up on a date night with my wifey on a sleepy Fullerton Boulevard...

Unfortunately the pho was lukewarm at best
Flavor profile the soup didn't please
The spring roll had a flavor of slightly cooked spam
That put the taste buds in my mouth ill at ease
The bo luc lac had chunks of filet 
Flavorful and seasoned just right
It was flanked by a bowl of yin-yang shaped rice
The buttery yellow part I could eat all night
The bun cha gio tom thit nuong was by far and away
My wifey's and my most favorite course
The lightness of the sauce, the crunchy egg roll
The perfectly grilled meats...must endorse

"All I wanna do is have some pho!"
But I was so happy that I got to eat much mo'
All I wanna do is have some pho
The best things they have there are dry bun noodles and luc lac bo
All I wanna do is have some pho
Warming up on a date night with my wifey on a sleepy Fullerton Boulevard...

So if you want Vietnamese but you wanna go
To a romantic modern date night restaurant
Go to Pho Olivia...the food's good but not great
But the atmosphere is all the A+ you want

"All I wanna do is have some pho!"
But I was so happy that I got to eat much mo'
All I wanna do is have some pho
The best things they have there are dry bun noodles and luc lac bo
All I wanna do is have some pho
Warming up on a date night with my wifey on a sleepy Fullerton Boulevard...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's okay.... the egg rolls I ordered were over cooked. Service is slow, below average, waiters avoid eye contact, waited 10 minutes to get our bill... not good during lunch hour.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My Son said...Best egg rolls in a long time...Young coconut juice was awesome!  My watermelon juice was fantastic!

Pho was solid good...noodles a bit clumped up, but taste was fine!  Overall the food was very good and service was friendly and prompt.  

 I'd go there again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent customer service! Great place for a business brunch or a evening date! Clint is awesome. He's a waiter there. I recommend the vermicelli!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review is for the newer location in Fullerton.  It does get a bit crowded here, in the parking lot and restaurant so it's best to come before or after the lunch rush.  I ordered the BBQ chicken and I gotta say, it's pretty damn good chicken.  It was brought to me by Olivia herself.  That made the dish taste that much better.  
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Four stars for good pho but had to subtract two  due to their tendency to close early. Got there at 8:37 and the guy said they were closed. He said last call was at 8:45... Wut... If you have a policy... Follow it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm a regular at this restaurant and I cant get enough of the great food and even better service! I was a big fan of their sister restaurant Olivia's Bistro in La Habra and was super excited to find out they had opened another location so close in Fullerton.

The restaurant itself is very spacious, I really like the high ceilings, open space, and comfy booths and they have extremely eclectic taste in music, which I enjoy. I'm a stickler for cleanliness so I really appreciate that they keep not only their dining room but their bathrooms spotless.

Foodwise, I don't think you'll find a place around here that will give you better quality for such a reasonable price. The pho is always consistent and you can tell that they put a lot of care into how the broth and ingredients are made. I am extremely sensitive to food containing MSG - I get a headache/stomach ache immediately after consumption- so I am amble to confidently say that Pho Olivia does not use any MSG in their food because I have not felt these symptoms any time that i've dined here, which is a main reason why I keep coming back.

Aside from the Pho, I really like to order the different types of spring rolls that they offer, and the beef salad is always tasty. I think the menu offers a wide variety of traditional and modern cuisine and it seems like they are always cooking up something new in the kitchen.

TL:DR - clean establishment, friendly/honest service, delicious/healthy food. Check it out!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was really impressed with this place. The restaurant itself was clean inside, the service was fast and very friendly, and the food was awesome. My coworker took me here while I'm in town for a business trip and I was wanting to have some good Pho in Cali before heading home and this did the trick. 

I ordered the number 1 which has all the good stuff and I left full and happy. I really have nothing negative to say about here and I would definitely come back when I am in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Vietnamese food.....drooling:) First walk in very clean, modern and the service is fast. You're sat and drinks magically appear! I had the egg rolls with noodles and fish sauce. Yum . Let me tell you, I've had some good egg rolls, but these were so crisp.....Omg. Tried the Pho, good as well.I think I would still order my noodles over the Pho. Everything was very clean and fast and fresh. Im really glad I tried this place. Another possible place to frequent. So good, go eat more noodles and egg rolls!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pure Awesomeness!!! Best Pho that I've had in my 37 years of a PhoTastic life. If you go for the Rare Beef or Brisket or Meatballs or any other... It's yours to enjoy! Chicken or Steak with 50/50 rice is insanely good. Melts in your mouth and your hands just the same. Seriously the best party people. The Best!

Now for the Service... Olivia is a great owner/operator. Greeted with a smile right when you walk in the door and right to your table. Took our order quick and helped the newbies that we brought along with the menu. Always checked on us and made sure the newbies were pleased. Just as the food, Pure Awesomeness!

I'm never one to judge a restaurant by its decor, but at Pho Olivia, you can't help but compliment. Beautious!!! 

All in all, love this place. Glad YELP exists so the word can be spread. Thanks Olivia!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nice clean resteraunt, have been here 3 times and all 3 were good, good food with a decent price. The only thing is that at most places snall bowls are $5-$6 and here the small is $7-$8 and the food isnt like its absolutely amazing. But its good enough<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">got a small rice noodle soup but I wasn't impressed by the food at all. I guess I expected more for an $8 pho. I like the decor and their choice of music though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Clinton was a great server. Veery knowledgable and everything he recommended was great. We got the pho Olivia and egg rolls with Thai ice tea. Definitely coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here twice already and my thoughts... it's mediocre. In my recent visit I had the bbq chicken with white rice and house-butter garlic rice. I think it's the lack of flavor they have that I usually get from other restaurants. This place isn't bad at all, it's just that I've had better. The staff was nice and attentive which I liked, but otherwise the food is okay.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm a student at CSUF and I was craving some good pho to have during my break between classes. The service is friendly and fast. I was greeted right when I walked in. 
I ordered a small pho with rare beef and it was absolutely delicious :) This place certainly satisfied my craving, especially with the nice decor, clean restrooms, and peaceful Christmas music playing. I'll for sure be coming back to this place next time I crave pho while at school.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After a night of punishing my liver, a hot bowl of pho really hits the spot. As we staggered to Pho Olivia and gazed at the rundown exterior, I was preparing myself to be served by old Vietnamese guys watching tv and cleaning veggies at an empty table. But looks can be deceiving! Pho Olivia was surprisingly clean. And for once, the waiters were nice and attentive. There was even some live music! 

The broth was great, the basil was fresh and the portion were large. It was everything that I've wanted  for my hangover.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm a huge fan of Pho and have had it in so many places including Hanoi, Hong Kong and Seoul. I would have to say that this is one of the best places I've had it. The broth is just amazing. Great spring rolls as well. Try the Olivia-Spring rolls. They are really good. Service is great and they are really friendly. I will definitely be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here many times, and Clinton gives the best service. Their food is great, unless you're a snob like Danica who eats 50 dollar pho bowls. Clinton is a studly guy and I couldnt keep my eyes off of him, too bad he is straight.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very good food, excellent customer service (but I always take out) and reasonable prices makes this a decent pho choice if your in the immediate area. However, portions are a bit skimpy here.(pho)
*Update* 
Broth wasn't quite up to snuff for me today
*Update*
Got the chicken vermicelli and veggie springrolls today. Chicken vermicelli was pretty tasty, spring rolls were so-so. However, maybe I'm just a fat ass but I was still physically hungry when I finished...and having paid $13 I felt a little ripped off.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is an awkward 2.5/3 rating for a lot of reasons, and note I've been here only  twice so far (the 2nd time being today only b/c I couldn't go to my usual place in garden grove.)

Appetizer got the shrimp spring roll very bland and not worth the money also pretty small. The sauce was good though.

My bf and I ordered large N1 which consisted of beef, tendon, brisket etc. At first glance the bowl is rather small comparatively to other pho places especially for a large" but I guess its there own medium version. The broth was decent, good flavor, but the beef didn't taste to fresh. Aside from that though it was okay.

The service is pretty bad though except for the host he's very friendly, but the servers really laaaag. We had to ask every time for a refill, and no one came by once except when a new customer came in.

Its not bad for being one of the only Pho places in Fullerton BUT I think I might just wait till I'm back down in Garden Grove for some real Pho :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you're looking for an authentic bowl of Vietnamese noodles, consider elsewhere. The pho here is definitely their weak point. I tried two kinds, and the broth lacked the flavor and complexity found at other places. It seems like the usual spices are missing and extra salt is used instead. It's decent if you look at it as a regular noodle soup, though. 

The sides are very stingily portioned! 

I also had their spring rolls and coconut sorbet. I had the spring rolls without mint (the only thing I don't eat) and it tasted bland. The sauce wasn't very good. It resembled thinned out peanut butter with a few peanut chunks and veggie slivers. 

The coconut sorbet was quite good! It was thick and creamy (not icy), almost like ice cream. It tasted like coconut meat, not just coconut juice. 

Service was kind and smiley. The restaurant (including the restroom) is very clean which is a pleasant change from the typical pho restaurant.

I'd be happy to return here for dessert, but not for Vietnamese dishes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went here to try something new, I go to Ellie down the street. I ventured here for the vegetarian menu as well. Glad to see another option of tofu and veggie pho soup!
The cold spring rolls were good in texture but totally bland. Will skip those next time.
The veggie pho was tasty, good broth and full of tofu (Ellie gives you 3-4 pieces, this large bowl had too many to count).
The interior is very nice, fancy but not too stuck up, it's pho after all. But I remember when it was Bionic Records, what a trip to be there now.
I will return for sure. Vegan approved!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The brisket pho was actually really good. And I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the restaurant was - you would never guess from looking at the outside of the establishment (or the tacky strip mall it inhabits). So, I would definitely go back for those two things. 

What would I not go back for? The traditional spring rolls accompanied by a peanut sauce with a completely unappetizing odor. I seriously had to push the sauce across the table from me so that I couldn't smell it anymore. And the roll just wasn't that great. Plus, it took nearly 20 minutes to get the pho (and I think that there was only one other customer in the restaurant at that time). So, I am not sure what the issue was there. 

They did have a good deal going - 20% of pho (dine in only), which made a generous-sized bowl only about $5.50.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The best & cutest place for Pho in the city of Fullerton. 
My friends & I frequent this place a lot for it's good food and friendly, chill atmosphere. 
They play live music some nights which are also enjoyable. 

May I add, this is also the only Vietnamese restaurant i go to where I have ordered food other than Pho.
Seriously recommend.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here for lunch with a group of co-workers/friends and all the time I was thinking to myself, hm..the pho isn't too bad but it's like missing something which I can't quite pinpoint.  Suddenly, one of my friends asked me "how's the pho? This place supposedly doesn't use MSG....".  Then it dawned on me, "ah no wonder, no MSG"!

So there you go, 

NO MSG = missing pho sweetness = not quite authentic taste

Service on the other hand was excellent!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to several pho places but this is my favorite so far. I always order the Pho Chin. The broth is perfect to me. It's not too intense but it is also not too bland. I go to this place whenever I feel like dining in somewhere but don't have too much time. The service is great. I get my order right away and the servers are very nice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like Pho, but I hate eating it at a place where it feels like you're sitting in a pile of dirt and grime. 

This place is like a magic door that takes you from the ghetto plaza that it's in (.99 only and Big Lots are next door), to an upscale dining room at a nice hotel. Wood floors and nice furniture? Ambient lighting and nicely upholstered chairs? AT A PHO RESTAURANT?  YES PLEASE!

Anyways, besides being a pleasant environment to dine in, the food is excellent. I've tried the pho bowls, vermicelli bowls, and rolls and they are always of the highest quality ingredients. THE BROTH IS AWESOME. AND HOT! 

Everytime I go, it seems like it is more popular. The service is awesome. The owners are really attentive and genuinely kind. 

Tip: Order a side of sliced onions, squeeze some lemon juice on 'em and drizzle with Tiger Blood.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is very nice and clean. The decor is very modern and the restaurant is spacious. We went around lunch and it was pretty much empty, aside from one table.

They have a very small menu and some items aren't on there when comparing it to other menus. Another menu is made of paper and some are wrinkled and dirty.

We ordered appetizers... Nem Nuong Cuon (grilled pork patties in spring roll form) and Canh Ga Chien Buu (chicken wings fried in butter). The nem nuong cuon was pretty good but I think it would've been better with actual peanut sauce. I don't know what kind of sauce it was but it was all right, not too bad. The chicken wings were pretty small in size, came with six pieces, and was okay/decent.

I ordered the Pho Tai Gan (rare steak and tendons) in a large and when it came out, the broth was hot as expected. I don't know how they make it the broth but it was blasting with flavor. I literally had an orgasm in my mouth.

My friends ordered the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong (vermecilli noodles with eggrolls and grilled pork). I tried the grilled pork and it didn't have a lot of flavor to it. The eggrolls were good though.

Prices are very high for what you're getting. Learned this the hard way.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This past weekend I was jonesing for some Pho.  I was driving home late Friday  night and all the Pho place were closed in Anaheim so I had Mexican instead.  So on Saturday I went to what I thought was a reliable Pho place and it just failed miserably.  On Sunday, I did some research and found Pho Olivia in Fullerton.  I've been to their Imperial Hwy location in Brea and it was really good so I was excited that they opened one closer to me.

Service - Yay! I'm a Fan - See Below.
Cleanliness - Excellent
Price - $8.92 (includes tax and tip)
Seafood - Yes, mainly shrimp.
Meats - Yes, beef, chicken, and pork
Vegetables - Yes, salads
Dessert - Yes, Greenbean w/ tapioca & coconut milk, sorbets, chocolate cake, cheesecake, etc.
Fruits - N/A
Other - (1) Located in the 99 Cent Only Stores shopping center.  (2) Free parking in large private lot.  (3) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here--the minimum purchase on Credit Card is $10.

What was ordered:

Customer Service (Complimentary) - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 stars) - I find "mature" women to be attractive--especially the Asian ones.  We'll just say I was enchanted by the proprietor.  Our eyes locked and she gave me a smile.  She gestured with her hands letting me know that I could sit wherever I wanted.  Wham bam thank you ma'am I had my food--all with that lovely smile.  From the corner of my eye, I noticed she would look over my way as she helped with other guests--to see if I needed anything.  

Pho Tai Sach ($6.36, Large) - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 stars) - The regular price for the Large is $7.95, but they were giving 20% off all entrees because of their Grand Opening.  The Pho Tai Sach is composed of rice noodle soup with rare beef and tripe with onions and scallions.  The Large is a good size--approximately 8 inches in diameter and 4 inch deep bowl.  The broth is good--"clean" tasting Pho broth with a beautiful clear brown color.  The beef is excellent quality and cut a bit thicker than most Pho restaurants.  Tripe was not overtly thick that it gets tangled up and was quite tender as well.  The noodles were perfectly al dente and they gave you a good amount of it.

Bean Sprouts, Basil, and Lemon (Complimentary) - A-Ok (3 stars) - My only complaint is that they give you such a small amount of the bean sprouts and basil.  I love bean sprouts and especially love filling my bowl with the basil.  Oh, Ms. Olivia, you are lucky you are so cute and you have that beautiful smile.

Was I satisfied?  My eyes were, but my stomach was still lusting for some "dirty" Pho.  Don't get me wrong, I like eating at clean Pho establishments.  However, I think that "dirtiness" gives Pho some ummph.  So if you guys can recommend a good "dirty" Pho place, holler at me.  Else, I will be back to Pho Olivia to 'fan' Ms. Olivia and her smile.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">found this place thanks to Yelp!  Still recovering from a stomach issue at the time, the only thing that was appetizing enough for me to even *think* about was a big piping hot bowl of pho.  The broth was flavorful, arrived quickly, and had a generous amount of everything.  Exactly what the doctor ordered!  I will definitely check out the rest of the menu!  

the place was neat and clean too.  i've been to my share of pho places where the environment made me question whether i should be eating there.  it was reassuring to know that i won't have a second bout of stomach anything after my trip here<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't do it!  I regretted going to this place. Just a little heads-up.

Service
In the middle of the afternoon, we walked in and saw the guy working there with his headphones on.  It's not like the place was empty.  There were a few customers there.  When we were ready to order, it took a while for us to get the person's attention because I couldn't just say "Hi.  Hello.  Excuse me!" because the only person working in the place at that time had his headphones on!  A few minutes went by and we were still waiting for the guy to turn his head around and finally a guy in the kitchen saw us.  If it was my business, I would not have anybody with the headphones on visible in the dinning area (doesn't matter if you are the boss/owner).   That kind of customer service screams, "Go away, I don't want your business!"  

Food
Overpriced?  YES!  I don't mind paying for a little overpriced dishes IF they were great.  I will pay higher prices for great tasting food. 

Let me start out by saying that I have had my fair share of pho, and this place is just very average.   I always have the pho soup whenever I go to Vietnamese places, so guess what I had at this place?!? Yup...Pho soup with all different kinds of meat in it.  I ordered large ($7.95) because the small bowl looked a little too small and sure enough, even large was much smaller than other pho places (It's a good thing I ordered large.  Small is probably for a kid).  When they brought the bean sprouts, lime, and mint leaves out, there was no jalapeno peppers.  I had to ask for it.  They just assume that we don't need them or decided not to give it out until we asked for it.  I see....never had to do that at any pho places before.  That was very minor, so that was ok.

We ordered vegetarian broth for chicken noodle soup.  The guy did not mention about an extra charge for vegetarian broth.  We specifically asked him when we sat down whether they have chicken broth or just beef broth.  He said, yes you can have vegetarian broth if you don't want beef broth.  I did not see anywhere on the menu about vegetarian broth being more expensive either, but they charged us an extra $1 for ordering vegetarian broth.  Isn't vegetarian broth supposed to be cheaper? At almost every restaurant, anything vegetarian is the cheapest, and once you add meat, it's a bit more expensive, and once you order seafood, it's the most expensive.   

It doesn't end there.  Vegetarian soup hardly had any meat in it.  My friend who is a slow eater for the first time finished her plate before anyone did and had to wait for us to finish and still didn't feel like she had enough to eat.  What is up with this place??

Customer service sucks with mediocre pho soup.  With all these pho places in the area, I will definitely NOT go back to this place even for free.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can't believe they only have 4 stars!? In my book, this place is definitely 5 stars!! The restaurant décor, cleanliness, msg-free food, and service are all excellent! 

I went with a large group so we shared a few dishes, and each got a bowl of pho. I'm sure glad I did! Because it was so tasty, we ended up pigging out and finishing everything. My Pho Chin Tai #4 was super tasty even with its msg-free broth. The soup was hot, meat tender, and noodles cooked to perfection. 

But the big surprise was the Beef Salad! One of the best salads I've had! I ended up ordering an additional plate because sharing with my friend was definitely not enough. The beef on the salad was good quality filet mignon, and their dressing was light and refreshing!

For dessert a must-try is their Crepes! They are super generous with the nutella and bananas so it was literally oozing out of the crepe skin. As full as I was, I still inhaled this sweet morsel of heaven. Totally did NOT expect a Vietnamese restaurant to have such delightful desserts! 

I'm already drooling over when my next visit will be!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Probably my favorite pho place in Fullerton. Good selection of different kinds of a pho and its DELICIOUS. The customer service is usually spot on -- except for the time if they asked only me if I needed chop sticks and not my other white friend. I CAN HANDLE MY ETHNIC UTENSILS. :)

They have a good selection of other dishes/appetizers.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was good, service was excellent even up to closing time. Took a Phö "first timer" and he loved it!

Banana crepes are excellent.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Located near Cal State Fullerton, this is the best Pho is our North OC area IMHO. They use the best quality beef and use no MSG in their flavorful broth. The atmosphere is cleaner and more inviting than most Pho places. I love their Olivia Spring Rolls, which are a copy of the Brodard one. Not as good as the original, but good enough for this area. Their Shrimp Rolls are very fresh as well. We have not had a bad dish here and service is good too. Highly recommend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great local pho place for any csuf student. Nice atmosphere and most importantly bomb ass pho. Grab the eggrolls as an appetizer and you cant go wrong.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I couldn't decide to give a two or three. The food portions are smaller than what one will find in lil Saigon. The price is almost double too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If I didn't want to go to little Saigon I would come here. Great place with nice service and food was always good. Looks very clean and simple.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">At first I loved this place. After today I am never coming here again! First, I order a Thai tea and something was floating in it at the bottom. They took it back and had the nerve to still try and charge me for it after their mistake. 

Next, he brings in the special I ordered which was the eggroll and salad. Mind you, before I ordered I asked the waiter TWICE "is the eggroll vegetable eggroll?" And he nodded his head and said "yes, yes." So when he brought it, I took a bite, and lo and behold it has pork inside. I haven't eaten pork for years, let alone meat. I am a vegetarian. I was disgusted. Then I told the manager, "I thought the eggroll was veggie." She responded, "if you want vegetarian you need to tell the waiter before hand." I said, "yes, I asked him TWICE was it veggie he said Yes." They both walked away with an attitude and they started smirking as if it was MY fault they got my order wrong twice. 

Customer service is horrible. I do not trust this place anymore. I will never eat here. They handled the situation horribly. I have never seen worse customer service in my life. It's a shame because I love Vietnamese. I'm just going to have to find another place to go to now.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just had the most expensive Pho and spring rolls here.  DON'T COME!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Starting with the good- The broth is delicious!  And the place is very clean and nicely decorated. It looks very fancy compared to most pho places. That's about where the good ends. The service is pretty bad, and it's pretty pricey. It was a good one time experience but I probably wouldn't come back. If your in the area give it a try for a nice dinner out on a cold day.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here bc of the high ratings from our fellow yelpers. But I kid you not, I'm writing this as I eat here. For the price and quality, just save your money. The noodle is over cooked (it literally melts in my mouth bc it's so over cooked), the meat doesn't taste fresh, and the soup is just plain&bland. 

A star for good service tho. Hopefully I just came in on a bad day and that normally food taste awesome here..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Time to play: Update review!

Love love love this place! I cannot say this enough. Pho bowls come in regular, large and super (Kal-el size). Each are about a buck difference between the 3 of them. You name the combination of beef, it's on the menu. Quality cuts of beef and decent portions of it. I'm yet to be disapppointed.

They have a mini appetizer menu for someone (singular or a pair at the most) who know that the pho will fill them up, both the broth and the noodles. I've tasted the croque monsieur and chicken curry skewers. I prefer the first but both are very reasonably priced, like a buck and half to two bucks.

Still love the very classy, easy-listening, and relaxed atmosphere. It's the definition of understated elegance. I love love love it.

The staff is very attentive and very very friendly. The pho comes out fast, as fast goes for pho. That means you can fill yourself up as fast as it comes. Keep that in mind. A pizza can never do that, nor can anything you have to wok, fry or whatever other method you can cook from the neighboring restaurants in the area.

So that's my review. I don't have just pho pride. I have pho love, and my love's name is Olivia.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What's the difference between an average pho and another average pho that's a little bit better?  Beats me.  And, given that a lot of pho eaters I know judge it almost completely by price, I'd say a lot of other people don't know either.  That being said, when the prices are this much higher then expectations sort of shoot out the roof.

SERVICE AND SETTING

It's the cleanest pho restaurant I've ever been in... by far, really.  I used to think Pho Ha in Brea was clean, but it tends to be loud over there.  This one is clean, quiet, and comfortable.  Service tends to be decent, which means above average for a pho shop.

FOOD AND VALUE

Of course the star of the show is their pho.  It's pretty good.  The noodles are pretty firm and the broth isn't overly salty.  Meat comes in pretty generous portions and if you don't get enough greens with it they're happy to give you more.

Of note compared to other places around here, they also have some French inspired side dishes here as well.  One stood out whose name escapes me, but it was diced chicken with veggies on top of French bread - worth a try.

Prices are quite high for a pho shop.  Expect to pay 1-2$ more than the other pho places in Fullerton which means like 4-5$ more than in Westminister!

CONCLUSION

Not bad, but not amazing, Pho Olivia stands out as one of the cleaner and maybe classier pho shops in the area, but be prepared to pay a little more than the other places.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I think the 4 star is a rather accurate review.  I haven't tried the actual Pho yet, since I don't see the meat cut that I like, just your typical brisket, rare beef, tripe, etc.

So I ordered a chicken salad and bbq pork rice plate.  I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I was thinking it'll be something pretty terrible.

Bottom line though was this:  It was fantastic.  That was some of the most tender chicken I've ever had from an asian food grill, not to mention flavorful.  The butter rice is interesting, but the name in itself has me health conscious.  The only thing was I wish they had a selection variety for the salad dressing.  Though I can imagine not a lot of customers would be ordering the salad, so it makes sense to not stock a ton of dressings.

I would recommend this place for their rice plates.  Have not tried the soup and noodles yet.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is amazing, staff is phenomenal, really huge recommendation to this place. I'll be back with friends!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't know why people would give such high ratings to this place when the food is so bland! Talk about food being catered to American palettes, this would be it. I was sincerely hoping that with the 4 star rating that I would expect food that was not only authentic, but mouth watering. None of which I experienced.

FOOD: 2 star

[ PHO TAI ]
When you eat pho, you rate it on how the broth is. That's what seriously makes PHO pho, other than the meats and noodles. Unfortunately, the broth was so clear that it literally felt like I was drinking hot watered down soup that had no richness to it. I had to drown my soup in sriracha sauce to add any kind of flavors to it.

The soup consisted of 90% noodles and 10% rare beef.. WTH. Talk about getting ripped offffff.

If you're a fan of noodles.. and just noodles alone in Pho Tai then this would be it. But I at least expect the meats to be in the 30%.

[ SHRIMP SPRING ROLL ]

Definitely regretted getting this cause not only was the spring roll's rice paper kinda hard and super chewy on my end (it's suppose to be soft when fresh) and the fillings inside where so sparse that you literally just taste the noodles and pieces of mint. The peanut sauce was THE worst I've ever had. Like seriously, don't even bother serving the sauce, cause all I'll do is pack it on hot sauce. It was taste-less and unappetizing. An appetizer that's unappetizing? GEEZ... how sad is that.

PRICE: 1 star
At $7.50 a bowl for their large, you really don't get anything but a massive amount of noodles.

SERVICE: 1 star

Wasn't expecting much from service since Pho places aren't known for greeeeat service you know? but all they pretty much did was just take your order and drop off your food at your table. DUNZO.


Won't be coming back here or ever recommending this place everrrr again. There are far better pho restaurants you need to check out instead.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was looking forward to this place based on the reviews on here, but I was terribly disappointed. The portion size was okay and the service was friendly, but the soup was bland, there was hardly any meat, noodles were clumped up in a large ball, and they gave really small plates for garnish. I also ordered an iced coffee that was pre-mixed so it was way too sweet.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I think I found my new favorite phó spot. My girl, and I were looking to get some good phó, I looked at this place up on yelp, and we like it a lot. Especially me, this is exactly what I look for when I take a girl out; a nice quiet, cozy spot, smooth music quietly playing, and dim lighting. Basically romantic. Good service too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here with a friend and we both ordered pho. The noodles were over cooked and the broth was super salty.  The food took long to come out, and my friend who ordered meatball pho didn't even get meatballs in her bowl. I also think that it's over priced for quality of the food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their Pho is excelltn, especially the rare beef pho. The beef is exceptionally tender and the broth is nice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I read the reviews and stopped here with my daughter on my drive down to see a concert at the Honda Center. Score! What an excellent meal. 

The crepe appetizer was magnificent. It arrived gorgeously presented, and tasted even better. The flavors were well balanced, and the taste of the coconut milk in the egg was not at all overpowering, rather was totally pleasant. You must wrap in the lettuce and cilantro and dip for the full effect.

My BBQ pork bun bowl was out of this world. The chargrilled taste of the pork was an A+. I savored every piece slowly. My daughter got the grilled shrimp bun bowl, and these were similarly excellent. The shrimp released taste with every chew,  with none of the unpleasant oft-encountered farm-raised shrimp undertones. 

It was a hot day, so we will have to wait until a rainy day to try the Pho. 

Oh, and if you like photography, there are five small but fascinating black and white gems hanging on the walls, street scenes of rural Hanoi from days gone by.

The owner was clearly delighted to see us enjoy her food and takes well earned pride in it. She pointed out that she reacts badly to MSG herself, so hers is a kitchen free of this additive.  Pleasant lady. I imagine that the (literally) sister site in La Habra is well worth checking out too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Olivia Pho is a well run and clean restaurant. I have tried the kalbi as well as the pho.  I must say that the food is delicious! I highly recommend that if you live in the Fullerton area that you go there or if you happen to be in town that you try it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I absolutely LOVE this place. Best vegetarian pho and egg rolls that I've ever had. It's a little hole in the wall place next to the 99 cent store in a strip mall that you would totally drive right past if you didn't know better. When we lived in OC, we ate here at least twice a week.  This inside of the restaurant is super clean, nice ambiance, and everyone working is always friendly and accommodating. The best part in my opinion is that the veggie pho is made with veggie broth, not chicken broth like most places do.  Vegan friendly!! If you're in the area, definitely give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After returning to Fullerton for the school year, I got back to Yelping new places (unlike when I was in Burbank and generally just ate where I liked). It's in the corner of the parking lot with Subway and Bank of America. What I noticed that separates it from Pho Lover (the usual standby) is that they offer other dishes alongside pho (well I'm sure Pho Lover does too, but it didn't stick out to me) so I ordered the banh xeo. I was quite pleased with my egg crepe thing and it tasted how I wanted to...delicious. Mmmm a little more expensive than Pho Lover, but the bigger selection is nice, so I'd say worth it. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yay for Pho Olivia!  Lately I think I've become a bit of a pho snob.  I've been to several here in OC and wasn't very impressed.  A friend of mine told me to try this place, I am glad I did.

The number one thing thats a good pho is the broth, and this restaurant's broth is delicious.  It doesn't taste overly salty like other places.  All the food is very fresh and so far everything we've ordered has been equally as good.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I really like the option of getting egg noodles, unfortunately they only serve their pho with rice noodles.  I know I know... pho is served with rice noodles, but I like egg every once in a while, and so do my kids.

The restaurant itself is very nice, clean and the staff are always pleasant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We would have to give the food 3.5 stars.  The ambiance and service is why we give them 4 stars instead of 3.  I had the Olivia special grilled chicken over garlic egg noodle.  It also came with vegetable soup.  My order was good, but I thought it would taste more special since it sounded like it was a special kind of noodle that was only made at Pho Olivia.  My wife ordered Pho.  She got the large size of N1.  It came with beef, tripe, inside the broth.  She said that the meat and vegetables were fine, but the broth was not as good as her favorite place.

Overall, we were very happy with our dinner.  As mentioned earlier, the service was good.  The server always checked on us, and kept our water glasses full.  As mentioned in other reviews, their prices are higher than other Pho places.  Still, I can recommend this place for a fine dining experience.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So disappointed the food was so tasteless ,never seen a Vietnamese menu like this one.Came here with some of my Vietnamese friends 2 of them wanted to order pork chops with Bi but they didn't have that what kind of Vietnamese Resturant is this .i order Pho but the broth had no flavor it's eating noodles and hot water ,the Thai tea was watered down and I could go on and on ,but to make it short this Resturant is over rated all the people that said the food had full of flavor had probably never had real Vietnamese food before .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The moment I walked in I could smell the  aroma. It smelled so good!!! I got more hungry! There's a lunch special and that's what I got. It was a really good deal and I was happy with it. Oh and their Thai ice tea was perfect it wasn't too sweet!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We ordered the Spring Special combo #4 which come with a large bowl of your choice of pho noodle soup, a small size of fried rice with very minimum amount of chicken and shrimp, and a small side of ice cabbage salad - all for $14. The food was decent in taste, but the basil leafs and bean spout were kind of old. Great customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's a great food!! 
Pho is very light and clean. so delicous!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Slowest service and longest wait for pho ever! I can't even tell if the pho was good because by the time it came out we were starving and I could've eaten a cow. On top of that they put meat in a request for no meat pho for a vegetarian. I'll stick with the run of the mill pho places that focus on getting you fed right away and take note of your requests. Sad place, go elsewhere.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If only I could rate this place below one star. 
I bought two to-go special bowls and when I got home, what I received was a bowl with like 3-4 four thinly sliced pieces of beef, no tendon, no tripe. Seriously? 

Next time if you order a to-go, please check it in front of those guys. May sound rude but you have to, if you don't want to be "fortunate" like me<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">More like a 3.5.

First time I took my bf to pho, and we're both originally from the San Gabriel area which is like the mecca of all Asian related foods so I've had plenty of pho. 

Ordered the spring rolls, which pretty average. You have the option of shrimp or pork, but not both? Or maybe it was my bad and didn't understand the menu right.

The pho comes in three size, and the small is more than enough. I got the rare beef and brisket, actually we both did, and it was pretty good. The broth didn't taste too sweet or anything, which was great. The little veggie platter that they brought out was missing jalapenos, which is one of my favorite parts. 

The service was a little slow, but friendly. 

AWKWARD MOMENT OF THE NIGHT: Older white dude singing Simon and Garfunkel type songs at a pho restaurant. He's not bad at all, but awkward nonetheless.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good Pho here. Fast polite service. Good prices. Right next door to $.99 cent store so it is real busy. Big parking  lot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pho is good and all,  but they gave me raw meat when I ordered to go. The soup isn't hot enough to cook that!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is Vietnamese food done right.  The owner was super awesome and so accommodating.. I ordered the Garlic Noodles... yummay! She won't give up the secret...but it's okay, that means I will return!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mmmm pho :p 

This place is really good. Food is great and service is great. They have live music every Friday night, so that's a plus. Overall, I recommend everyone try it at least once.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After reading the yelp reviews, I thought this place was going to be delicious. I came here with my co-workers because it is fairly close to our work and we were craving pho. The interior was really nice and clean so I was very happy with the ambiance. We ordered our food and when I took my first bite after putting the sauces and what-nots in it, I was extremely disappointed. The broth was bland and oily. I definitely had better tasting pho. After being disappointed with the pho, I thought maybe the spring rolls would make up for the lack of taste, but I was again, disappointed.

Overall, lunch was dissatisfying for me that day.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The noodle had too much cloves, and there was no beef essence in my beef noodle soup. The sauce to my nem nuong was weird. It tasted like mustard or something.  . I actually got an upset stomach 30 minutes later, so this place is not for me. 

I do have to compliment the waitress though. She was very attentive and checked up on me a few times.  That doesn't usually happen at Vietnamese restaurant, so thumbs up for her.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's  nice to have a decent Pho place near school.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A nice clean pho. I would say their vermicelli bowls are better than  their pho but it's all pretty decent.  The portion sizes are bit small for the price but it's close to where I am so it does the job. I'll be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food and friendly staff! Loved their fried egg rolls. Combo menu was a good value.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually got to royal thai bbq next door but was only somewhat curious when i saw that pho olivia was open. Seriously though "pho olivia?" who the hell is olivia? Or ellie? (pho ellie) nearby. My gf and i were heading for some thai but decides to give olivia a try and hope that she's welcoming. The first thing i noticed upon entering was the super high ceiling and how new everything looked. Whoa the olivia employees were so fast to greet us and sit us down! (we were 2 of 6 people there. Workers included). At this time i still wasnt sure about olivia but i did like the customer service and how different the decor was. It didnt remind me of the grimy dirty places in garden grove. Just to be clear i dont mind dirty as long as they make the food taste good. Ok to the point. The food. Yes the portions were nice and the food was highly delicious. It was a weird experience because it tasted like i was in garden grove but it was super crowded and i didnt have to fear for my life on the road from crazy ass drivers. I kid, i kid. No i'm not. I am not saying it tastes as good as whats prepared in garden grove but it doesnt taste like it's trying to cater to those not used to pho. It is just fine and dandy. For the price and proximity i will be going back pho sho!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually pass right by this place when I am going to either the 99 cent store, Thai Rama, or Quickly. My friend visited earlier this week and so I thought I would drop by and give the place a try finally.

When I came in, I was seated immediately. After ordering, I ended up chatting with the two men who play music on Fridays apparently, but had been called in to play love songs for Valentines Day. I got my Thai Tea fairly quickly after ordering, and got a look around the place. The interior decorating is very nice and clean, and despite being relatively small the overall ambiance inside was very nice.

The Thai Tea was okay. When I got it I stirred it up and took a sip to see how it was. I had read several of the comments about how it was really watered down so I was expecting the worst. I was surprised to find that it was actually okay flavor wise, but did notice as more time passed, it did become pretty watered down to the point where I could barely taste the flavor of the Thai Tea. 

Entree wise, I ordered the BBQ Beef with the garlic butter rice. The serving size was quite generous and the food itself came to me quickly, or rather what I felt was quickly. I came alone and was in no real rush since I had come after my last class for the day and had no outstanding plans for the rest of the evening. The presentation of the food itself was nice, and the meat proved to be tasty. I ended up eating all of the meat and having a bit of the garlic butter rice leftover since I was too full to finish it. The two band guys were pushing the idea of the banana and nutella crepe, but at this point I was just too full to even consider dessert.

After I was done, I moved my plate to the side of the table so it would be more easily seen by the waiters or other employees that may pass by. My only real complaint is that I ended up waiting about 5 - 10 minutes for my plate to be picked up, and I understand that by then the restaurant was also much busier than it had been when I had walked in, but by the time they came by and picked it up I had taken out my sketchbook to pass the time. 

Overall I really like this place so far. Perhaps next time I come I will actually try their Pho or other dishes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have only been to this Pho restaurant on two occasions. The first times the service was pretty good. They greeted us and served us in a timely matter. There was nothing that I could say about them that would hurt their reputation since their service was actually pretty good.

The second time, I ate there with my family after my graduation from Cal State Fullerton. The place was pretty busy and there was basically only about two people serving the entire restaurant while I'm sure the rest of the crew were in the kitchen making all the orders. Despite the amount of people at the restaurant at the time and even though it did take a little while to get our order, about 12-15 minutes, their service was in my opinion excellent. There was even one occasion where one customer was nagging one of the employees about her order despite the fact that the place was pretty busy. Regardless of the small rush, the servers still helped us and served us with a smile and were even able to refill my drinks almost instantly. 

Overall as far as I know, I believe these guys represent how servers should perform on the job. Despite how busy it was, they were able to convey the idea that we were welcome to their establishment. I totally recommend coming here for Pho since, needless to say, their food was also excellent.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We've sort of recently, within the last couple of years, really gotten into Pho'.  Pho Olivia is one of the best I've found.  Now that they offer a Vegan/Vegetarian option, I like it even better.  
The Vegetarian Spring Rolls are pretty darn good too.  Not the biggest fan of their peanut sauce, but with Hoisin on the table, you can't go wrong.
We generally try to go here on weeknights, as we've found weekends, when there is live music, to be pretty crowded.  
All in all, I generally recommend Pho Olivia to anyone that is looking for some good Pho'.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">$8 for lunch includes bun Cha gio but tax and tip. Nothing special about the food. Great service but I would only come here if I was craving for Vietnamese food but nothing else was around.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What a find!  I didn't expect much, being it's located in a strip mall and the exterior is completely forgettable.  As soon as you  stop inside though, it's a whole new story.   The place is well decorated and just emanates a nice atmosphere to have lunch.   They had lunch special skewers, and we orded a lemongrass one and the curry one.  Both were delicious! The bf ordered the XL Pho and I had the Vermicelli...the portion sizes were great, the service was attentive, and the food itself was scrumptious.  I think I've found my new place to frequent on my lunch hour! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We unexpectedly stumbled across this little hole-in-the-wall (at least from the outside) because our original plans feel through. What a pleasant surprise! Clean, modern decor, courteous service, and a great ambiance (with live entertainment to boot) definitely made this a place I'd return to. 

I enjoy Pho, but I would not call myself an expert. Nevertheless, it was tasty and filling (with generous portions). For the price you pay, it hits the spot!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The owner is very genuine and kind.  She helps out with the local community and Students at Cal State University Fullerton.

Aside from the business owner.  This restaurant is a very cozy and romantic setting if you want to go out for lunch or a date.  

For a Vietnamese Style Restaurant it is very authentic menu selection outside of Westminster (Little Saigon).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you're looking for good clean pho without the msg this is your place!  Yes, it's a hole in the wall location but the ambiance and service isn't bad. 

We started with the spring rolls. They make their own sausage. It's not spam. The sauce is amazing!  I would enjoy a bowl to eat like soup. It's got bits of chicken and crab and has a slightly creamy consistency. I had Bun or vermicelli noodles with lemongrass beef. Best I've ever had. 

Dessert was a thin light crepe made with rice flour and filled with bananas and nutella. It was a great way to end the meal!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This will be my go-to pho restaurant! For $6.95 I got a small pho Tai (rare beef) which was perfect on a cold balmy night. As other yelpers mentioned, it's in an unassuming strip mall and right next door to a 99 Only store. Go inside and it feels modern, clean, and somewhat upscale. 

The beef in my pho was so good! I'm admittedly a slow eater so by the end of the meal, my beef gets a bit tough, but not this one. That's when you know it's high quality ingredients. The broth was delicious! Flavorful and just enough fat, not overly fatty. The small was perfect for me but they offer one larger size too.

Btw, the women's restroom had 2 stalls and was super clean! YAY! Given the size of the restaurant, I wasn't expecting a separate mens and womens let alone 2 stalls in the women's bathroom.

Thanks Yelpers for introducing me to this gem. Btw, they were about to close for a private party when I was there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of my favorite pho spots. Staff/service are incredibly friendly. This place is a little on the expensive side, but they usually have great lunchtime specials.
Even so, after countless visits to Pho Olivia, they haven't let me down once. I order the small size pho with chicken (white meat, which in my opinion, tastes best) and it's usually the perfect size.
My go to pho spot!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my first review ever and probably my last, but I HAD to give Pho Olivia their due credit. I literally signed up just to write this review. I absolutely LOVE this place. I've been all over the place and this is still hands down my favorite pho restaurant. I never realized just how difficult it is to find a pho place with a good house combo. This is the only place I've been where I can get both tendon and tripe along with the beef. The broth is delicious and never salty, although if you like your broth a little saltier they do have salt available at the table.

The service is always great and efficient. Within a handful minutes of sitting down they took my order and my food was at the table. I went in tonight and I could have been out in less than 30 minutes if I wanted to because they are that quick, but I decided to sit and relax for a little bit with some hot tea, which has free refills. I never felt rushed to get out despite having already boxed up my meal and slowly working on my pot of tea. I've come here when I'm hungover, I've come here when I'm sick like tonight, and I've come here when I'm just craving a good bowl of pho. I really don't get there as often as I like but that's because normally when I go out for food I go to where my friends are which is other parts of Fullerton and the surrounding cities. Every person I've been able to bring here loves it so hopefully I'll be able to get more people to try it out in the near future.

They also have a much more modern set up than any other hole in the wall Asian noodle soup restaurant I've been to (that includes ramen, udon, and other pho places), which is a nice change. Tonight, because I haven't been feeling too well, I considered just getting it take-out, but I love the service and the atmosphere so much (and what I've got isn't contagious) I decided to dine in and I wasn't disappointed.

As long as I live in the area this will be my go-to pho restaurant. I just wish they had a location out by my parents' house that I could go to when I visit them.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went to csuf to get things done for my first semester, wanted to see what kind of pho spots are really good around the area. Pho Olivia came up first on yelp, so I'm taking the risk.

I walked in and it was really clean, casual with a very mild formal taste. The workers are very "smiley" an friendly. Ordered the Pho Tai and Thai Thai. 
Thai tea was alright. The Pho is very good, despite the fact that they don't put much meat in the broth, the meat is very high quality meat. There's not much noodles in the soup either. Nonetheless, the pho here is good, and no one can take that away from them. Just wished it was a little cheaper. Most of the vietnamese places I've been to is the 6 dollar range, even for the bigger bowl sizes. Their A O spring rolls are delicious too, but instead of the sauce they give you I just use the sriracha. Bomb....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time visiting tonight, we love this place. The decor is modern, clean, and tranquil.  This place is clean!  Bathrooms are spotless. The food is delish! Pho broth has depth of flavor, tea is freshly steeped, and everything is very balanced.  The service was wonderful.  Our waiter was excellent and the owner visited our table, as well as others as we finished our meals.  Fresh, delicious, and uber hospitable - we will so be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been wanting to try this place for awhile. After having my heartbroken and not eating much for two weeks and it being suddenly cold weather, it was time. 

I saw the sign outside that said "20% off" and was stoked. Then I saw the  M-F in small writing and it being Saturday... damn. 

I just ordered the Pho w/ Rare Beef. The bowl was big. Lots of soup and loaded with noodles. I'm not really sure if I like the broth or not. It was on the sweet side. Never tasted broth like it before. It was different, but, I don't know. Nonetheless, I did finish it off.

Service like all Pho places was fast. 

Atmosphere was decent. 

I may try them again. Maybe my depression had an effect on my visit. It's possible. Nothing seems good when you feel empty inside.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hmm, have to disagree with with most of the high ratings.

Price:  Fair compared to Irvine, expensive compared to Westminster
Portion:  Small.  Ok for kids and ladies.  Not for the marathoner.
Taste:  Fair.  Pho broth is good.  no MSG does detract a bit.
Service:  Good.
Facilities:  Very clean, but a few annoying flies by our window seat was well, annoying.

Overall just A-OK.  Will probably opt for a dirtier place for better food next time...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pho Olivia serves the tastiest pho found anywhere. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. This is my family's favorite restaurant and for good reason.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My boyfriend and I headed to Pho Olivia last Friday, after reading the (mostly) positive reviews on Yelp. 

We arrived near closing time (at around 8 pm), and were greeted with a pleasant surprise -- a local band singing 1960s-1970s Classic Rock!  The best part -- one of the servers played the fiddle alongside the band when he wasn't helping diners in the restaurant.  

I ordered bun (or vermicelli noodles) with eggrolls and BBQ pork.  It came with a plentiful serving of lettuce, bean sprouts, herbs -- definitely refreshing, tasty and perfect for a warm summer night!  My boyfriend ordered the pho with rare steak, which was seasoned well and fresh. 

It was definitely a delicious and unique experience; I've never listened to live renditions of "Scarborough Fair" while slurping on noodles before!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious pho, good price, fast and friendly, well appointed place. What's not to like?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came in here a few months ago and really enjoyed the service and the food.  I like their crepe and vegetarian options.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I'd definitely go back again when I'm in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this little place! The pho is delicious and the spring rolls are so refreshing. Last time I was there and got the coconut sorbet for some dessert and it was sooo good. I may have even liked the presentation more than the actual sorbet because the serve it in a lil coconut half shell! Haha so cute. Try this place. Quaint and good service!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can not stay away from this place and make a point of eating here every time I'm in the area!  The service is always great and super fast and the food is incredible.  The pho broth is absolutely delicious. It's definitely my go-to when it's cold outside! I highly recommend this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pho Olivia is the best Pho Restaurant in Orange County!  It is by far my favorite.  In addition to the pho, I also get egg rolls and chicken wings which are so good.  The Pho is authentic, with fresh and clean vegetables, large pieces of lean meat, and the the perfect broth.  The staff is always friendly and attentive.  Very clean restaurant which I recommend to anyone!  Enjoy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their beef salad is very similar to Brodards except they put sliced almonds in it.  I love it!   One of my favorite pho restaurants that makes EVERYTHING well!

Spring rolls: 3 (Sorry guys.  You guys are good BUT you can't beat Brodard's famous spring roll.)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Never again. 

My sister and I came here on a Sunday afternoon and were the only ones there. We walked into a dark restaurant with a guy sitting in a booth watching TV on his laptop. After we sat down, he turned on the lights and music for us. My sister asked for boba, which they advertise on their window, to which the server told us they had "run out for the day". Um.. it's like 11AM. My sister then asks for just the milktea that is the basic tea you drink boba with. The server brings us back a glass of green tea with lime in it, and a bowl of coffee creamer. Are you fucking kidding me?

At this point, we should have left but decided to stay and order our pho. I order a large bowl and my sister orders a small. We get our food, and the amount of noodles is pathetic. Not only do our bowls have the same amount of noodles, the total amount of noodles is about the size of a tennis ball. Being as polite as possible, I go up to the server and show him the lack of noodles in my bowl. He briskly asks, "so you want more noodles?" to which I reply "yes." He brings me a small ricebowl of noodles on the side. 

After we finish our mediocre meal, we get ready to pay. We were actually charged $2 for the side of noodles! It was unbelievable. I have never left a restaurant so unsatisfied. 

And the best part? The whole time we were eating our food, the server was sitting in the booth across from us watching TV on his laptop.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I use to drive down this street every day to go to work before I moved and never noticed Pho Olivia until this past week when I went with a friend.  We had a late lunch on Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty much empty except for two other tables.  Upon entering, I noticed that it was clean and well-decorated compared to most pho places.  This was definitely a nice change.  

We both ordered the cold vermicelli since it was way too hot to have a bowl of hot soup.  The waiter was pleasant and told us about their new specials on their menu.  The vermicelli (along with our thai iced teas) were plentiful!  I am usually able to eat my entire bowl without much hesitation.  Strangely, both my friend and I felt like it was the bowl of vermicelli that never ended.  Thankfully, it was flavorful and generous in their portions and ingredients.  

I would say Pho Olivia is an upscale vietnamese restaurant.  Yes, you will be paying about $1.50-$2.00 more per entree.  But, you won't have to deal with the sticky tables, floors, or blaring music.  

Which leads me to my last point.  I understand that it was a slow Sunday afternoon.  But, all the servers basically disappeared into the kitchen or back room somewhere after we got our food.  The restaurant felt like ghost town.  It would have been nice for them to come sometime during our meal to check to see if we needed anything.  Nonetheless, when we finally found them when we were ready to leave, they were more than helpful.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I go to school in fullerton and I was not looking forward to driving all the way to westminister just for some pho on a cold day. I have been here twice, the first time I went I was impressed with this place, but the second time I went, it was not as good as my first. When I first walked into the restaurant, I thought it was going to be an americanized pho restaurant because the place was so nice and clean.

The first time I ordered pho tai and my friend got the thit nuong dish. I honestly could not get over how great my pho tasted that day. It might also have been the overcast that made me feel warm inside but the broth and texture of the beef that day was to die for. I also had a bite of my friends dish because her plate came with garlic buttered rice. Oh lord, that rice made my jaws drop! I took another two bites after that because I could not get over how good the rice tasted.

My second time I went, my friends and I all ordered pho. This time, my pho did not taste as great as the first time. The broth had tasted a little different and not as rich. BUT the meat texture was still nice and tender. 

The service here was mediocre. They do not really pay that much attention to the customers. We had already been done eating for maybe a good 15 minutes with some left overs and they did not ask if we needed a box to go. 

Other than that, I was still impressed with its overall quality and wouldnt mind going back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm in the area a lot and sometimes drop in.  The food itself is about 3.5 stars, but the service is a solid 4.  The restaurant is in a plaza next to the 99 cent store, but it's actually got a great ambiance, not what you would expect driving by.  The portions are large and very fair priced, I get the rare beef pho, it's good, but a little more sour than some other places.  I'll keep coming back, good food and good atmosphere.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to many pho restaurants with my business partner, particularly in the OC/LA areas and this is currently my favorite. 

Food: 10/10 love the pho here. Noodles, broth, and meat are excellent. Everythings fresh and you can tell

Service: 10/10 could not possibly be better. You walk in and are immediately greated with warm friendly service. Food arrived within minutes of orders (literally the fastest sit down service I've ever had). They filled our waters before we even knew we were out. Everything was perfect. 

Atmosphere: 10/10 (11/10 on Fridays!) very different from the "average" pho place with yellow lights and plastic cups, here you get proper booths/tables, glass glasses, and plastic chopsticks. Fridays are an extra treat as they have a live band playing classic rock! One of the servers accompanies the band when not helping customers and is possibly one of the best violinists i've ever heard live. 

Price: 10/10 Only a dollar more expensive than most pho places (my large pho tai chin was only about $7.49) which makes this place seem so cheap when you take into account everything else. And their large is indeed a large same size as most pho places. If you're feeling extra hungry they offer an extra large! 

I'm not usually one for long reviews, but I felt compelled because this place is so good. Definitely a gem near Cal State Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My goodness I love this place! 

While going to school I lived about 5 min from this Pho Olivia, and I went at least once a week if not more. Let's just say I went so much that they knew my regular order! (Eggrolls and N4) I graduated in April, moved to Long Beach and tried another place once (which didn't even compare) in the 4 months I was there. 

I have since moved back to the area, and I am so happy to be close to Pho Olivia again! I don't even know where to begin. The pho is amazing. The vermicelli is amazing. The fried rice is amazing. The salads are amazing. The egg rolls and spring rolls are amazing. I tried another appetizer one time, some kind of pork on a stick in a spring roll wrapper, also...AMAZING. Also, when it's really cold, I always get the hot jasmine green tea. It's served in adorable little cast iron teapots. Love it. And they have wonderful vegetarian options. I am not a vegetarian, but I have friends who have said repeatedly how much they love this place. The veggies are fresh and crispy. The meats are tender and well seasoned. The noodles and rice are perfection.

Once I came here and they wouldn't serve us pho because it wasn't up the the quality that they wanted it to be. I was a majorly impressed. One, they probably risk losing a lot of money that day not serving pho. Two, there are plenty of other delicious things to order that it really didn't even matter. Also, we got a little discount because of the minor inconvenience.

Recently, I had friends, who frequented Olivia's while they were in school but have since moved back up north, come to visit and of all the yummy places to eat, they wanted to have dinner here. Additionally, they claim to think about getting pho from Olivia's about once a week. Bottom line (if you didn't get it from my previous paragraphs) THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. The food is amazing, the price is affordable, the ambiance is relaxing and the service couldn't be better. An all around great place to have a meal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My FIRST Pho!

I'm open to suggestions of "better" places, but I had a great experience.  I went with a friend (well-versed in pho), he said "they want to appeal to white people, pho places don't normally look this nice.  They're more geared toward turning tables" (he's from El Salvador).  It was very nice inside, they were playing Sinatra, the sole server this Sunday afternoon was very friendly.

I wasn't sure what to get so I just ordered the same as my friend (veggie and tofu pho and young coconut water [?] to drink).  Loved loved loved the water!  Very refreshing!  Ordered a canned version later that night (also good, though not as much so).

There wasn't anything I didn't enjoy about the meal.  Everything seemed cooked well, everything tasted good, the produce appeared and tasted fresh, nothing was too heavy or salty, and it wasn't too expensive.  I'll be going again for sure!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nothing beats a hot bowl of pho on a cold rainy day...or that was the goal.  The pho was hot, and the rest fell short.  The broth was bland and tasteless, and there were exactly 4 slices of beef in the entire bowl.

We usually head to Westminster or GG for Pho, but figure to try this place because it was so close...We were completely disappointed, next time I will head to the Pho shop off imperial for something close.  Everything just comes across completely mediocre if that...What a waste, there goes an hour of my life I will never get back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I work at the high school down the street and had to get some emergency-to-go pho so that I can fuel my soul. I was told about this place, got there as they opened and walked out of there 15 min later with the basic rare steak pho to take back to work. They kept the broth separate from meat and all, so that I could nuke the broth when I was ready to eat, reheating it enough to cook the steak immediately as I mixed it. It tasted incredible and was basically therapeutic. I've had good pho and bad pho but this pho was no joke. A large was $7.95 but the meat was good enough quality to be worth it. Two thumbs up from me!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you are looking for a quality and authentic Pho, this is the place!   Since I've discovered Pho Olivia, my family comes here at least once a week for beef noodle soup instead of driving to Little Saigon.  I have tasted many Pho restaurants in Little Saigon where it is known as the place to eat authentic Vietnamese food.  Once I have tasted the beef noodle soup at Pho Olivia, there is no turning back when it comes to eating pho at other places.   The quality and consistency in the broth are far superb!  The broth is clear, tasty and not overwhelming with spices.  We know not all filet mignon are of the same quality.  The beef served here is so tender, tasty and delicious. 
   
This is a family owned and operated restaurant.  The staffs are very friendly and their service is of the highest quality.  They warmly greet my family and remember our order every time we come here.  The restaurant is very clean and the décor is simple and elegant.  It is truly a hidden treasure when it comes to the best Vietnamese's beef soup.  They have one location in La Habra and the second one in Fullerton.  I highly recommend that you give it a try when you are in these neighborhoods.  For me, a thirty minute drive to this place for a delicious bowl of pho once or twice a week is truly worth the drive!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay hi non Vietnamese customers. This place is probably one of the worst pho restaurants I've been. Trust me. I've come here hungover and it's still not good. The pho broth is not even clear meaning it's been sitting for God knows how long. Let alone do we even know it's MSG free? I don't understand how this place has 4 stars. Pho Ha or Pho Ellie is way better than this wannabe.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Never had Pho and was looking to try it, so naturally I relied on my handy dandy yelp app to find the nearest and highest rated locations around me. This location happened to be in the same center I was already in, convenient. Being the highest rated Pho joint around I decided to check it out. 

This food establishment is located in a dingy dirty strip mall, but not the case for this hole in the wall goodie. Very clean inside and a completely different scenery change from the chipping paint of all the buildings and dirt stained concrete side walks. Their menu is a little difficult to decipher considering the foreign language is first and you have to read the description in order to know what the item is. They have a large list of soups and rice dishes, but the one that stood out to me most was the Vietnamese crepe appetizer.

 I ordered one of those and my girlfriend ordered a chicken pho noodle soup. The crepe came on one plate and on the other was lettuce and a little dipping bowl with sauce. I was a bit confused but the waiter, who was very helpful and excited to be a part of our first pho experience, told me that the crepe gets cut into slices, wrapped in lettuce and then dipped in to the sauce. Yum yum is all I can say to that. The crepe had beef and been sprouts and was in an egg milk batter, hardy and delicious by itself, but when wrapped in the lettuce and dipped into the sweet sauce it was quite a pleasant treat. It was both an entree and a dessert. The soup was good, just noodles, chicken, broth, and veggies. They were smart and included multiple side items like bean sprouts, lime, mint leaves, and hot sauce to customize your soup to your own liking. With the right amount of hot sauce that broth became the ultimate ill recovery soup. Portion sizes were generous. Everyone who came in asked what the small soup size looked like and the waitress would point to another customers bowl and everyone who saw it stuck with that size. I will push the limit one day and go for the large.

Everyone their was very polite and prices were decent. Entrees between seven and ten dollars, but for the amount of food you get the price is worth it. I did enjoy this place, I continue to support its four star rating and look forward to my return and have another go at that delicious crepe.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very good pho; ambiance and service was good to boot.

They have a cheesy singer with a guitar on Friday nights which kinda ruined my dinner...food was still good though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I regularly eat here and enjoy the food. But tonight the service sank to new lows. I haven't seen Olivia or her sister here in many weeks and it is showing in the level of service and appearance of the dining area. The two guys waiting tables were shabbily dressed in t-shirts and jeans, just not a professional appearance. 
Olivia- you need a new rule for your wait staff: NO LAPTOPS IN THE RESTAURANT. The shorter waiter just couldn't break his attention away from what appeared to be a movie on the laptop in the staff booth at the rear. The tall waiter did 90% of the work, but he too kept grabbing glimpses of the laptop screen. 
A dad with three younger children had to go to the rear and ask for assistance as he was finished and the kids were restless.
My food was served rather on the cool side, probably sat on counter for a few minutes during an exciting movie scene.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The other day we came upon this place. It was cold and raining so we decided to eat here. The service was great, food was fast. The pho broth was one of the best o have had. Over all this place was great will come again soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i had to write this update with my dad in mind, because the man is over 70 years old and if anyone knows their pho, it's him. we came here after the airport one day because he was hungry, it was close by, and we didn't want to navigate the crazy streets in westminster for a bowl of pho.

after ordering the pho tai, dad leans over and takes a sniff. i hold my breath in anticipation and felt anxious for the owners. he didn't even add any chili, basil, or lemon before scooping up a spoonful of the broth to taste. finally, he declared (and i'm translating here): it's good. not too much star anise taste or smell. the broth is clear and naturally sweet. it's not bad.

not bad?!? coming from dad, that's the equivalent of excellent in my book! i dug into my bowl and ate it with relish, knowing that i was eating a not-bad-equal-to-good enough-bowl-of-pho from the pho master himself.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tugged in a corner of the mall and easy to miss if you didn't know where you are going.  I was in the area and looked up Yelp for a quick bite.  The place looked recently updated, clean and simple.

They greeted me quickly and took my order.  The food is just what I expect to get and tasty.  I was in and out of there with very reasonable cost.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love pho but I stopped eating it because it's so unhealthy.. Soo much msg, you can taste it and definitely feel it afterwards.  This place doesn't use it.  It just tastes fresh and healthy. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place and come here all the time for lunch. They make very good banh xeo, pho, ect...

Just recently i tried their special garlic noodle with shrimp, have to say this is the best yellow noodle dish i ever had.

Highly recommend anyone who wants to eat good vietnamese food to come here. Anything you order is good, And gotta mention the service is great too, very rare to receive good service at any vietnamese restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location just can't live up to Olivia's in La Habra. Sometimes it's good but not always. The last time I was there the egg rolls were pre cooked and when they served them to us they were already cold and chewy. The noodles in my vermicelli bowl were under cooked. The service is not great either. Our whole table, except for one person, had their food for at least five minutes before he got his soup. You always have to ask for the check and when I'm in a hurry that is really annoying. Not good at drink refills either.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my first bad review on yelp and I feel horrible!  I gave a 2 for the friendly service. During the time I was there with my friend, the restaurant wasnt that full, so "busy" couldnt have been the excuse. Here are the reasons for 2 stars as follows:

- Was excited to drink the thai ice tea but was in for a huge downer! The tea itself tasted extremely watered down and the boba was all crumbled up and weird at the bottom. Told them in the nicest way possible with a smile that it tasted watered down thinking maybe they just messed up on this one drink. BUT NO! The waiter just poured more of the same bland drink in after removing some of the ice, leaving the same terrible boba at the bottom. I didnt have the heart to send it back again so we just left the full glass on the table. They never questioned why we never drank it the whole time we were there.

- Usually pho restaurants take about 10-15 minutes or LESS to bring out your pho. This place took about 45 minutes and there was no one else besides my friend and I at this point! As for the pho, it was decent..but not decent enough to wait 45 minutes for. Also, there wasn't that much meat. 

- Pork rolls weren't the greatest. They were ok. 

We came in really excited and hungry due to all the ratings on yelp but left unsatisfied. I recommend anyone that wants amazing pho to go to Saigon Noodle House in Diamond Bar, CA. I've gotten about 5 of my friends addicted to their pho and their pork rolls are super good. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! 

I love the lunch specials. I love the people working here, super sweet! I also love the thai iced tea yay :)

I crave this whenever I drive down chapman.


and their banana chocolate crepe is really yummy!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pho Olivia a quaint place, tucked in the corner of a plaza on St College Blvd. and Chapman, right down the way from CSUF. 

I met up with some of my friends and we were starving.  The nice waiter took our orders quickly and got us some waters and tea.  

I got the pho tai chin gan (pho with rare beef, brisket and tendon).  The broth tasted clean, tendon was delicious and I instead of brisket I asked for the filet mignon slices instead.  It was pretty damn good.  I love my pho with extra sprouts, basil leaves and lots and lots of sriracha sauce.

Service was attentive, always filling our glasses with water, asking us if we needed anything else.  

I will say that $7 for a large bowl at Pho Olivia is kind of high, considering the fact if you go to Westminster, a large bowl is usually $5-$6 and it's a LARGE bowl.  

Overall, it's a good local place with good food and the restaurant was clean.  Stop playing that weird jazzy music though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">PROS: Pho broth was good, chicken w/ the half & half rice was good, super friendly service, nice decor.

CONS: not enough noodle in the Pho<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my go to place for Pho! I HEART it! Especially when I'm sick, the husband knows to pick up a bowl for me and I'm happy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What a wonderful place.  Pho was excellent.  I had the Pho Ga.  Moist chicken and savory broth.  Herbs were fresh.  Couldn't ask for better.  My husband had the Banh Xeo and spring rolls.  Price for the entire dinner was very reasonable.  Pleasant feeling in this small, friendly restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">friendlty service. good consistent good. overall good place for Vietnamese food in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely my favorite pho. With awesome prices!

The staff was really nice as well. And the portions were large as well.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a review for their take out.

I tend to eat my take out as soon as I get home (so its as fresh as I can get it once I get in my house.) So total time between receiving it and getting to my house  5-7 minutes.  I ordered the Pho tom and the shrimp cuon (spring rolls). 
'
Pho Tom (Shrimp Pho) - The broth was quite delicious, not greasy, not strangely separating between water/oil. The noodles all BROKE at the grasp of my chopsticks. Now, I don't believe I have superhuman chopstick strength, and this hasn't happened to me before, so why oh why were the noodles all crumbly. Its ok, they still tasted fine, but not great. Plenty of bean sprouts and lemons, but all I got was one teeny tiny sprig of mint; no basil, no jalapeno. Lots of shrimp; I compare this to other pho places I've been, where you order shrimp pho, you get like 3-5 shrimp. I had a good 9 shrimp in my pho, bonus!!! 

Shrimp Spring Roll - Very fresh flavors; roll itself had a very generic flavor. The gold is in their peanut sauce. It was a very good sauce, with whole chunks of sauteed peanuts and some carrots and whatnot. YUM!

The ladies were very hospitable, and the decor of the place was really nice. I plan to come back to dine in. Maybe I'll have a better experience with the noodles.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I eat a lot of pho. A lot. Of course I'm never really critical and compare any restaurants to a homemade bowl of pho, but I have to say this is one of my least favorite pho places I've ever been to (#1 being a pho restaurant I tried in Paris...worst decision ever). The thing that put me off was the weirdly sour aftertaste of the broth I have never experienced before. It was sort of tangy and not pleasing, and I couldn't even mask it by drowning it in hoisin and sriracha. I also ordered nem cuong which was also very underwhelming. I'll probably veer away from here in the future and settle for the place a little up the street if I don't feel like driving down to Westminster/Garden grove. At least service is good and it's clean?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Set in a strip mall across the street from Cal State Fullerton, this is a hidden gem.  The pho was on the mark and was really more than I could eat.  The spring rolls just crunchy enough - a mark of freshness.  I've visited several times and I've never been disappointed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is greeeeeat. Olivia served us herself and was so nice. It was superbowl sunday and she told her fam to stay home. she worked the floor by herself! The pho and rice plates were really good. I recommend everyone go here if they crave good pho! We came from san francisco!!!

not written by me. 



very intense pho eating music playing in the background. 
Clean bathrooms always deserve  5 stars. then you can shop at 99 cents store!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time ever trying Vietnamese.

Wanted to try something new on a Friday night and headed out with my wife and two kids (5 and 7) in tow.  After reading other Yelp reviews, we decided to give it a go.  We all had a small bowl of Pho, and shared a rice dish and shrimp rocket appetizer.  I had two "33" beers, my wife had a glass of wine and the kids split a soda.  Total bill after tip was $72.  The price was a little steeper than I thought it would be - about what we pay when we go out to sushi.

The place was clean and modern - Very unassuming from the outside.  Staff was great - made recommendations and were very nice. 

Food was good.  Not knowing what to expect, we all ordered different proteins.  Shrimp, beef, chicken and seafood.  All four were good - the chicken being the only one we may not order again.  

We will be back, but would have liked a slightly lower bill.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Haven't tried the pho yet, but the rice plates were good. BBQ chicken was tender and fried rice was flavorful.  We ordered an appetizer (spring rolls), 2 entrees (BBQ chicken and chicken fried rice), soda and coconut juice: total was $22. Not too bad for all that food. Definitely coming back to try their pho!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OK so I originally was raving about Pho Olivia for the Pho Broth. I came back here a 2nd time and just ordered Pho, and Pho only! I was dissapointed. Sadly, the broth resembled nothing of the original promotion. At first taste I looked up at my wife and we both had sort of a sad face. We were really looking forward to the Olivia broth that we knew of the place. We ordered Pho Tai w/ the meat on the side.... fail. 

Several weeks later I decided to go try Pho Olivia out in case the 2nd time I came back was a fluke. All restaurants have a bad day here and there, I won't penalize them forever for one bad day. So my 3rd time I came in and ordered Pho Tai again. Fail.... the broth is no longer full of beef bone fresh soup stock. I know the taste when I try it, this was your average Pho seasoning powdered stock they use to maximize the ROI. There are plenty of 50% off Pho places that have the same broth that I can get so NO I'm sorry this was utter fail. 

Sadly I don't think Pho Olivia will make their fresh pho anymore. If they do, please update because I will be back but until I get confirmation I'll stick to making it at home or going to a 50% off place if I'm in a pinch. I give it 2 stars because the Pho isn't bad... its just not fresh nor a good deal. Its average which is a 3 but considering prices vs. other Pho restaurants, it now becomes a 2. Sorry. I like you guys but unless I was just in the area and had to have pho, I'd skip for something else.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for an evening meeting. It's not really crowded during dinner time. It's actually a bistro, so every feels and looks nice and a dark plaza. Anyways the prices are a little more expensive (like Irvine pho) but it's 20% off which is really nice, making it slightly more than Garden Grove pho. The pho tastes okay here, but the thing that really stands out is the quality of the meat. It's really tender and flavorful. This place is a nice diamond in the (plaza) rough.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for the first time yesterday, my friend & elite yelper Ashley recommended it & it was next on the list after Pho Ellie which I really wanted to try but found out they were closed on Sundays. Me and my guy were hoping to cure our hangovers & he had never tried pho before so I figured it was a good time to try it :) We got a booth by the window, the atmosphere was nice & the servers were friendly and smiling. I was super stoked to find that they had a vegetarian-friendly section on their menu!
I went with the veggie pho, he ordered the chicken. We also got the spring rolls as an appetizer. I have to admit, those were a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting more of a traditional spring roll, crunchy & full of veggies. I then realized that Vietnamese spring rolls are not the same as Chinese, ha. They were definitely better with the peanut sauce & sriracha, but considering I was about to eat pho, I felt like eating a spring roll with rice noodles, bean sprouts & tofu was a tad redundant, and they really didn't have much flavor at all. Oh well. 
The pho definitely made up for it. This was my first experience having vegetarian pho from a restaurant (as any vegetarian/vegan knows, most places still use beef broth even if you order it "vegetarian"). It was delicious! Lots of tofu & I loved the variety of vegetables. My guy liked his as well, and was excited at the prospect of eating the leftovers later. Overall it was a good experience and I would definitely eat there again! :)


*EDIT* This review is actually from April 2012, I just realized I had all these reviews saved on my profile that needed to be completed! But I just went back a couple weeks ago & ordered the veggie pho again... still fantastic! I love this place & will definitely keep coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The best pho I've tasted and NO MSG!! Is that like a first??

I've been to both the locations, here and the one in Fullerton. Both great! I love the feel of the restaurants because it is definitely a classy Pho house in comparison to all the others. They always play classy music as well. 

On to the food. I have a love/hate relationship with Pho. There are periods I go through hating pho and periods where I crave it. I can eat Olivia's Pho during either period. The broth tastes very clean and the quality of meat is excellent. Also, their noodles are cooked perfectly al dente. I've also tried their chicken vermecelli and love it. For dessert, I recommend the coconut sorbet, which is delicious and their homemade mungbean and taro tapioca. 

Probably one of the best experiences I've had at any vietnamese restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I think it is not easy to make the basic Vietnamese cuisine feel upscale, and the prototypical impression/image of a mom and pop Vietnamese restaurant (and the shopping center that it sits in) doesn't help the cause.  Pho Olivia makes a noble attempt to make both the food and restaurant environment more upscale, without tagging on a huge premium price tag.  The restaurant is clean, tastefully decorated, and with above-average service.   I believe they offer live music on certain evening. The food is good (although nothing spectacular) and they offer some seasonal "set" meals which make things more interesting than just having the familiar affairs which are on every restaurant's menu.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My daughter and I love Pho especially on cold days and if it's rainy all the better! We live in the neighborhood and shop in the center often. We're huge fans of the 99cent store, The Goodwill and Big Lots. Aaannnyway, when we saw a Pho place was opening we were excited and it felt like forever till they were ready to open their doors. 

When they finally opened it took us a couple of weeks to visit, but when we did it was fabulous! We ordered the shrimp rockets as an appetizer which are medium sized shrimp wrapped and deep fried, but not greasy and very tasty!

We ordered 2 bowls with rare and cooked beef. They came out quickly and the broth was yum! It's not greasy or salty. The kid felt there could have been a little more meat in her bowl, but I felt the serving was fine. 

The staff was very friendly and the decor is elegant, a pleasant change to the other Pho we usually go. 

We haven't had time for a second trip, but with the weather as of late and it's winter break I know we'll be back soon.

Quick note: Parking can be difficult if you try to park in the front lot, but if drive around the back of the bike shop, as if your headed down the alley, you'll find easier parking and a walk through into the center. Olivia's will be immediately on your left.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My fiance and I went here for lunch because of the good reviews; however, we had the complete opposite experience. We ordered the rocket shrimp (similar to shrimps in a blanket) and 2 pho tai (rare beef). We went around 1pm on sunday and it was barely busy...maybe 2 other tables. It took 20 minutes to get our appetizer and it was not worth it. It was 8 dollars for 6 shrimps and the shrimps were small as well. Two other parties came in after us and even got their meals before us which I thought was odd. The meat in the pho also was overcooked. Most likely would not eat there again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is probably the best Pho restaurant I've ever been to! The ambience was what got me hooked right away when I walked in. Vietnamese places I've been to eat Pho are usually pretty dirty and obviously not going for aesthetics or cleanliness. However Pho Olivia is the complete opposite and I immediately felt comfortable as I was sitting down. There were oil lit centerpieces on every table and condiments were neatly arranged in cute wooden boxes. The lights are dim and very soothing. It really is such a shame that this place is in the corner of such a run down shopping center :(

I've been here twice now and each time the service has been impeccable. I sure do love a place with good service, doesn't anyone? Both times I've come with friends and our table was always checked on and we were always asked if we needed anything. It was great!

Let's talk about the food now...the broth of this Pho was unlike any other! The first time I ordered the small Pho with brisket and although the soup and noodles were very good, the meat wasn't to my liking. This didn't detract the number of stars I gave because I admit that I am an extremely picky person when it comes to meats, so it isn't quite fair to rate low because of that. However everything else was very good, including the shrimp spring rolls we got as an appetizer; the veggies inside were super fresh and tasty! The second time I was here, I got the small regular Pho with no meat. That was literally the most appetite satisfying bowl of Pho I've ever eaten. I had every last drop, and still craved more. The portion however was perfect! 

Overall I say, GO TO PHO OLIVIA! You will most definitely not regret it, not even in the slightest! Perfect ambience, food, service, what more could you ask for?! This is my new Pho place and I will be going frequently!!!

P.S. The live music on Fridays is an added bonus! It made my second visit (which happened to be on a Friday where I had no idea there would be live music) all the more enjoyable! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is definitely great..no doubt about that. Prices are steep for pho/Vietnamese food,though. Waiter was very nice..although it took the longest 5 + minutes of my life to get waters/drinks placed at our table. Wife and I just came from being at a park for an hour and were quite thirsty. I had to kind of bark through the dining room to get waters,which was semi embarrassing,but other than that slight hiccup things went well. My fried rice was exceptional and my wife's vermicelli dish was good also. Also plates weren't cleared for 5-10 minutes after we were done eating,and we were only one of two tables occupied in the place. For the price,I feel service could have been a bit more punctual. Would have given 5 stars but they lose a star for service. We may go back,or we may try other places in the area next time. So many to choose from in Fullerton area,we are looking for a better balance of food quality,environment,service and value than Pho Olivia offers.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Maybe it's just me, but ehh.
I expected more from a Pho place. The wait was pretty long... even for our drinks (&& we were the only customers there ! -.-) The food was ehh also, I order the cube beef ($9.75). OMG that is the smallest thing I have ever seen, being a petite lady, that still didn't feel me up. Also OVERPRICED. That's not even the worse part; I'm a soda drinker, but the sprite I order was GROSS! It was either in a dirty cup or they never never ever clean their dispenser. I ask for a new one and they return 15 min later claiming it was new. It tasted the SAME. Plus the lady said she tried it too (wait: out of my straw? & is the same straw in my supposedly new cup? WTH) ? Still EWWWWWW! YET SHE STILL CHARGED ME FOR IT! & I didn't even drink it, all I did was return it! 


Long story short, this is the worst Vietnamese place I have ever been. (I am viet and I been to many places ) But this eh...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everything about my experience at Pho Olivia was fantastic (except for my hangover)! Went in a group of six, and even though the restaurant was pretty busy they quickly accommodated our group. Service was quick and friendly - we had them running with our million ice tea refills and requests for extra sides. 

The food was excellent. This was only my second Pho experience, but my experienced friends even agree its one of the best Pho places around. Broth was very flavorful, meat well cut and of course the Thai iced tea and the iced coffee were both amazing. I definitely started sweating out all that alcohol lingering from a wild Saturday night out. 

You definitely feel like you're at a legitimate restaurant at Pho Olivia - not some janky strip mall joint. Highly recommended!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great Pho place!!!

As you can see, my last name is "Nguyen" (probably the most common Vietnamese last name!!  hahaa), so I've definitely had my fair share of homemade pho...and this place is REALLY GOOD!!!

It's definitely comparable to a lot of pho places out in Westminster/FV, although somewhat pricier, but thats expected.  I always get the pho tai, and the broth here is what makes it!!!

The staff is friendly & the ambiance/decor is very inviting!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When I saw that Olivia's Bistro was opening up a second location in Fullerton, I was thrilled.  Honestly, I had never been to the location on Imperial and Euclid, but I had read stellar reviews on Yelp, and was excited to dine at their new digs.  :) My boyfriend and I drove past this plaza three or four times during the month of July / early August, hoping to find that the place had opened up.  We finally got our wish this week!  Right now, as a grand opening special, they are offering 20% off all entrees (dine-in only).

As an appetizer, we ordered their egg rolls, which were super tasty.  You'll notice that Pho Olivia doesn't skimp on the good stuff; these things were positively crammed FULL of meat, and came with a dipping sauce that was to die for!  After we were done shoveling these delectable little rolls into our faces, the pho arrived.  *cue harps and angels singing* We were VERY impressed by their pho.  Right away, we noticed the broth was very dark.  Dark = flavor!  Then, as if that weren't awesome enough, we finally laid eyes on the meat.  My God, it ACTUALLY LOOKED like MEAT!  Most of the pho places I've been to seem to have thin, ghoulishly-gray colored meat that's either way too fatty or way too tough, and questionable at best.  Not Pho Olivia!  Their meat was tender, juicy, and best of all, there was tons of it!  They had the perfect ratio of meat, noodles, green onions, and even a floret or two or fresh broccoli!

The pho here was about $1 more than many of the places I've been, but the broth and quality of the meat MORE than make up for it.  Hell, I'd pay the extra buck just for the sheer ambiance of this place.  All new furnishings, dark wood floors, comfortable and stylish booths, gorgeous artwork, and actual porcelain soup spoons instead of those cheapy plastic ones.  It's just an overall "pho experience" that can't be missed! Olivia herself even came up to our table to chat, ask our opinion on the food, and find out a little bit about us.  Will definitely be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's good, and it's five minutes from the family house in Anaheim. It's a beef house, like most I've been to in the OC, and the most notable thing about this beef house is that the rare beef seems to be paper-thin slices of tenderloin - silky and succulent if you get a hold of them before they become well-done. 

Very good service, too. Probably geared as much for gringos as Asians...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been going here for the last 6 months with my family.  It is hard to have a restaurant that is consistent month after month after month...but Pho Olivia is able to accomplish this.
Food is always tasty and good.  Service is always attentive, expedient and friendly.
Yes it may cost a bit more than other Pho restaurants, but you get what you pay for.  Here you get good food and good service with an ambience of RELAX !!!  Music selectionsare "groovy".<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Who doesn't love Pho? 

I love Pho it's the best remedy to my sickness or/and my hangover.

Let's be honest, to go orders suck! Then alone to go pho? Is that really possible?

Yes!!! The first time I had Pho Olivia was to go. 

Was I impressed the way they packaged everything to the tee. You're noodles are placed in a bowl. No need to get any dishes dirty when you get home. Everything is seperated and packaged in quality containers.

The Pho itself is amazing. Noodles are great the broth is to die for!

This is the spot to go to for TO GO PHO. I ate there the following week. And it's the cutest cleanest pho place i've ever been..Don't be fooled by the plaza and the little corner it's in.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fuck dis place<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was excited to hear of a pho place within walking distance from my house - even better, they offered a 20% discount on all entrees for their grand opening special! (yes, this review is late because I am a procrastinator)

Ambiance was great - modern, welcoming and clean. Another star was for the pho - not the best pho I've ever had but pretty good with plenty of meat. One waiter also had pretty good service and came to refill our drinks without being asked. Another star. :)

Here comes the bad stuff...their menu is very limited! Being Vietnamese myself, I looked for drinks such as my usual soda chanh muoi (pickled lemon soda) and soda sua hot ga (egg soda) but had to settle for soymilk instead. They also did not have many appetizers or rice dishes which made me sad =(

Minus another star for their prices. Everything was $1-3 more than pho places in Garden Grove, or even at other pho places that popped up around here recently (Pho Ellie, Pho Yummee, Pho Hoang, etc.)

My last issue was the other waiter. He was supposed to wait on our table but he kept talking to the American customers teaching them Vietnamese words and totally ignored us...wtf?? Just because I can pronounce pho the correct way does not mean you can ignore me. We had to get the other waiter across the room to help us though, and he was pretty good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yum!  Plus cute atmosphere.

My table ordered Pho Tai's and spring rolls.    

The spring rolls were great as was the peanut sauce.  Up to standard.

The pho was piping hot, rich in flavor with a clean textured broth.  Everything tastes very fresh and clean.  The serving size is a bit small for the price, hence -1 star... more noodles in my pho please~

Tasty pho, nice atmosphere, and friendly service makes this a pleasant pho cafe to dine at.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here with my friend who's only had pho once before this summer. I ordered a small bowl of pho tai chin and he ordered a small bowl of  pho tai.

The pho was actually quite delicious, however for $7, the small bowl was really small.

You could go to Westminster or Garden Grove and get twice as much Pho in a bowl for around $3.50 to $5.00 tops without looking too hard.

Great noodles and broth though. :)<p>
