<p itemprop="description">Yum yum yum! Great service, great food and great pricing! I arrived around 6 which was still happy hour time. Happy hour runs from 2-7. Although they have a huge variation of food, I stuck with their happy hour specials. I tried their spicy BBQ wings...AMAZING. Put it this way, I'm a huge pizza lover and even though there was a pizza next to me, I was stuck on these wings. Haha. Pizza was really good as well. There isn't really much to say without repeating myself.

Although it's a sports bar, they have a dining area and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Very well kept area and not even the people there are sloppy. I loved it here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Honestly, this place wasn't that great. 

We came in on a Tuesday night around 6:30pm, and it wasn't that busy. We waited at the front for maybe five to six minutes to be seated as the girls who were working at the bar saw us but kept delivering beers to the other customers there. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed, I'm assuming.

Service, overall, is pretty slow here. It's such a spacious restaurant with not enough people to cover the areas occupied. Our waitress did the best she could to serve and check up on us, so I appreciate the effort!

We tried the flight of six beers for $9. They have a great variety on tap. We liked the ones we chose! We also ordered the mini garlic knots during happy hour for $4 for four pieces. Those were super good. Aside from that, we ordered the wheat marinara pasta. Honestly, I personally felt it was too sour and watered down. There was a bunch of flavors going on in my mouth that I wasn't much fond of, but I didn't want to waste the food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My mom and I came here for lunch as we were in the area. The restaurant is located next to Chase and 85 Degrees, underneath some loft apartments. 

We came in and it was super busy and loud in there. Our server seated us in the middle of what seemed to be a kid's birthday party so we asked to relocate to a quieter area. Our server obliged but did not look happy. 

We were looking at the menu thinking of what to get and the server came back literally every minute to ask if we were ready. We were finally ready after she came by three times and she still looked unhappy as ever. 

We got the North Shore pizza and Garlic Parmesan fried chicken. It was only until the server took our orders down and I complimented her handwriting that she finally took that frown off her face :/ 

We got our orders within 15 minutes so I think that was reasonable for a busy afternoon. However, we realized we didn't have any napkins, plates, or utensils so I tried to grab our server's attention. After 5 minutes of attempting and waiting, I got up to the bar area to get the utensils myself and our server never came back so I'm assuming she forgot. 

As for the food, it was mediocre at best. The North Shore pizza is a Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and ham. I took a bite and it was so flavorless because there was barely any sauce or cheese in there. I would have taken a picture of the insides of the pizza but that's just gross. The garlic parmesan fried chicken was too greasy and I think the quality was not worth the price. We had to take half of our food to-go. Maybe I'll give the leftovers to my imaginary pet dog. 

It got busier and busier as we were eating and it was literally a madhouse in there. I'm definitely not coming back. I rarely leave one-star reviews so this rating speaks plenty. If you don't care for the quality of the food or service and just want to watch a football game, then this is the right place for you. Because they have TVs in the bathrooms too. Oh and make sure you get your parking validated. After 30 minutes, you'll be charged 4 dollars per hour in the garage.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">PARKING
Free 30 minutes parking in the structure but they do validation for all day! There's also limited street parking right around the corner.

INTERIOR/ EXTERIOR
Located on the corner of the University House, same building as the the 85 Degrees Bakery and Chase. They have plenty indoor booths and tables and also patio tables outside.

MENU
We stopped by in the afternoon for a bite to eat. Ordered the onion rings for appetizers and it came with a side of ranch and ketchup! Pretty small portion for its given price, but they were delicious! Paired with a cold beer and it would have been perfect. We also ordered the 10" individual size Hawaiian Pizza which we did not like. I'm all about the pineapple on my pizza, but the pineapple did not taste fresh and might have been straight out of a can. Also, the pizza was layered with way too much cheese which masked any other flavors except the strange pineapple taste.

There's definitely better places to eat but I can see myself stopping by for appetizers and a drink. Happy hours are 2-7 p.m. every day!

SERVICE
Great service! Our server was sweet and came to check on us a couple of times during our visit.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Well today I woke up to a very nice compliment in my feed from someone who I assume works at this location. I am sorry my review and my opinion which we are all entitled to has really irritated you.

"You know it is quite disturbing that your post is still up. You said short and sweet... Yet you laid it on thick and over the top.... And then to top it off you had your husband give us 1 * as well. The two of you came in on our best ($$ wise) ever. It was standing room only. So, when you say short and sweet....Mean it!!!"

Thank you for your feedback sir. I would like to clarify a few things and make some points.

Feel free to read my experience here in my previous review if you desire to.

First off, when I said short and sweet, it was considered sarcasm. Also, I find that more lengthy reviews are a better explanation of the experience, as opposed to one or two lines that say "This was good." or "This was bad."

In regards to my post still being up, I was unaware that we just remove reviews as time goes by, especially when the business in question has no desire to fix any situation or feel sorry at all for it. I wonder if this applies to good ones too.

I did not ask my husband to write a review. He chose to write one based on his also bad experience. We write reviews of our choosing on our own time.

I am sorry that we came in on a busy day. I was unaware that this was our fault that the staff here went to every single table but ours and ignored us for over twenty minutes without one person even coming up to ask what we would like to drink, let alone order food. I am glad that every table that came after us received help though. I will have to take note to walk back out the door to any business who is busy. Then again, due to other one and two star reviews complaining about the horrid customer service even on slow days, I am pretty sure that this was not the issue. They also chose to sit us where they did when we specified that it did not matter. I did not think it was okay to ignore any customers, ever. 

Now I can't vouch for the Oggi's at the Orange Village now, but when I went years ago and it was packed on a Saturday night, everyone was acknowledged, received food and drinks, and their bill too. 

It seems that bad service is a common issue at this location, based on other and even more recent reviews. You guys do have a nice auto response with the same exact message to multiple individuals about being sorry and you will do what you can to make it a positive experience. It seems like a drained out auto response without a single care to do anything about it, and it shows.

Your additional bad attitude to customers who had a bad experience is also a reflection of you and the staff here as this seems to be common practice. Nasty over a review from a bad experience? A lot of owners actually do appreciate these wake up calls and thank people as they admit that they were not aware of the issues happening and they do fix these. I guess being a chain restaurant, it is more unlikely, but still.

Seeing as the person who wrote me has one review, a one star, complaining about his horrible customer service experience at another business makes this even more hypocritical and funny. I guess it is okay when people complain about other businesses other than Oggi's Fullerton. If you complain about them, it is YOUR fault. Also, it is not always good when people only jump on Yelp to review one stars and bad businesses. It is always good to write the positive ones as well and help businesses, the ones who deserve it.

Over 350 reviews later, this is the first time I was insulted for having a bad experience. I expect nothing less from this location from my experience and other reviews.

Thank you again sir. I will DEFINITELY give this location another shot! This is also sarcasm.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great Food Great Price Great Service Friendly Staff-- Overall, great place to watch sports<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TOPS! The buffalo style pizza was delicious! Great flavor, non soggy in the middle and just the the perfect crunch on the crust! I had a small complaint about the sound during the Dodgers playoff game and you know whaaaat?! The OWNER came to find out what was wrong AND handled it! Will definitely be back!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What I had:
-medium Oggis special pizza ( good size for 3 people)
-3 garden salads 
-free cinnamon twists for checking in on Yelp 

Pizza pros: plenty of toppings, fresh dough, 
Pizza con: The bottom of the pizza was kinda doughy instead of crusty

Salad pros: good Italian dressing
Salad cons: small for price, not that crispy, it was served on a warm plate so this could account for the limp lettuce. 

Cinnamon twists:
I can't say anything bad about free food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sit at the bar if you're wanting to watch games with a fun crowd, like NCAA championship. Sit at the tables, if you're not really interested in watching the games nor want to be around those who are yelling and screaming when players are making 3 pointers with less than 5 seconds on the clock. 

The boneless chicken was ok. Nothing special. The pulled pork sliders were slightly disappointing. It had a weird taste to it. The fries that came with it were good though. The drinks could do better. We ordered a whiskey coke. There was nothing wrong with the whiskey portion of the drink, but the coke was so flat, I couldn't tell what I was drinking. we saw that they set aside a glass of coke to make their drinks, and it looked like it had been sitting out for hours and days. There was no carbonation at all. The server was nice about it and went back to the kitchen to get another glass of coke to make our drinks... but i feel sorry for whoever orders the next drink that needs coke..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great pizza & selection of Beers. My friends and I had great time watching UFC at Oggis. I liked how there was no cover to watch the fight. Jenn & Kymm were very knowledgable on which of their over 50 beers to get for myself.  The heavy weight pizza (Canadian bacon, ground beef, Italian sausage, salami and pepperoni) was so good. 
The only negatives I felt during my visit was on this UFC night, I thought they could have utilized the patio more,  because it was pretty packed inside. 
I'll definitely come back to for my beer and pizza needs.

</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just ordered large pepperoni pizza , 2 lbs boneless wings, half order chopped salad ...this was a takeout order ..and I ordered in restaurant and waited there for order ..I say this because there is no excuse for what happened...as I walked to my car I was wondering why the pizza box didn't feel hot ?? I live 5 min away ..got home and pizza was barely warm ...and barely had any sauce ...ridiculous...wings were like warm as well ..very disappointing...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Finding this restaurant tucked away in a plaza with various Asian eateries, I went today for dinner to celebrate a friend who got on the dean's list at CSUF. It was my first time at Oggi's, and between the 5 of us, we shared a traditional calzone, an Asian chicken salad, garlic knots and 2 servings of Oggi stix. Goodness was everything delicious, warm, fresh and flavorful! 

Not to mention, our server had the most upbeat, warm and welcoming attitude that positively just added to our experiences! Shout out to Christina for being such an amazing and attentive server!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So we went back to Oggis for Linner last week and were very disappointed. We all ordered the exact same thing we ordered the last time we went. 

My daughters Calzone was under cooked.

My wifes Tortilla soup was a different color and the portion was smaller.

My sons pizza was smaller, it was dry, and had less toppings.

My Limon Chicken I had ordered with angel hair pasta and it was served with Linguini noodles. I informed our waitress and she said the cooks were still being trained. WTF? How can you be a chef/ cook and not know the difference between the pastas? 

Upon leaving we read the sign saying it was under new management. I suggest going back to what was working. Cutting down portion sizes while charging the same high price is what runs customers off. I hate to say although we really like the food we will not be returning to this location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best place for CSUF students. So close to the university you can walk there.
Plus your parking is good for 4 hours, so if you have a short class you won't need to buy a day pass at the campus.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went back to oggi's again for football last week, awesome service and again great service. Really can't go wrong with the food here, it's mostly traditional sports restaurant food but everything is done great. Definitely helps that there are TV's everywhere you look too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I recommend coming on Saturday when they have Happy Hour all day. The pulled pork sliders were really tasty and not dry at all. I'd also suggest getting their Scottish ale if you don't like hoppy beers; it's really smooth and has a nice caramely flavour. 
I don't know why other reviewers gave them only 1 star claiming their service is terrible. We had a server who was extremely attentive and always checked on us.  Obviously when it's super busy, the service will be slower, but you shouldn't blame the servers...blame the other patrons who are probably asking for several items, ordering, taking forever to make a decision, and/or drunk flirting with the servers. Lol.
I'd give the place 5 stars, but the pizza prices are kind of pricey -- it's probably because it's near CSUF. Any place near a college is pricier. 
PS. If your eyes are bigger than your tummy, beware...portion sizes are huge.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oggi's seems to be under new management! I was strapped for convenience and time on the last day of finals, and while Guppy's has just closed, I needed food, and I wasn't prepared to eat another sandwich! 

I opted to give Oggi's another try, and I was not disappointed. I don't think you get the best product for your dollar, but Oggi's satisfies. I had their garlic knot and half a salad. The half salads are a good deal because they're still way big, plenty filling and plenty generous. The chicken was pretty fresh in their Balsamic Salad. Overall, the product quality is alright, but the service stood out.

The manager greeted me warmly, and checked in a couple of times while I waited for my takeout order. She greeted me by name, and although she was clearly busy, she took the time to ensure I was taken care of.

Overall better experience, I'll be coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Co-workers and I came here one time because it's close to work and there was a Groupon available for a lunch special. 

Most of us ordered a salad with garlic knots, and the food was decent. But the service? The blonde girl who waited on our table was snotty and is the reason why we now walk right past their restaurant anytime we're nearby. 

Three stars for food, but one star for service. No thank you.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's a great place for watching a sports event with great Pizza and flatbread. The owners are amazing with a great sense of public dealing. The waitress who served us, was a Lebanese lady named Maggie who was brilliant and very sweet. 

I am someone who has always risen against discrimination regardless of any race or religion. Sadly,I had my first experience of racism here, from a Black guy ironically . There was a table next to us who were celebrating a birthday with lots of alcohol. While I was talking to my friend about the fight and celebrating the Connor Mcgregor victory, the guy next to us started coming into over personal space and asking us to fight him outside. He made racist remarks about my race just because I am an Arab from Dubai. The owners were very nice in diffusing the situation and I can understand things like this can happen when the alcohol is flowing. 

To the guy who was racist, it is not my fault that I am from the Middle East I didn't choose to be Arab just like you didn't choose to be black. I have always and will always stand against the discrimination that has occurred and still occurs against my fellow Black brothers and sisters. I didn't expect you to be racist. Peace and Love.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Can't really say whether I liked the food or not. I've always enjoyed the other Oggi's locations, and figured I'd stop by this one about 9:30 last Thursday night. The sign said they were open till 11:00, and there were plenty of other customers there, so that seemed perfect. Well, as soon as I walked through the door, the hostess gave me a dismissive "oh, we're already closed." So that was that. No pizza for you.

Won't be spending any more effort, or money, on this location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">dopest sports restaurant ever! try out the buffalo chicken wrap. just enough kick. tried their house margarita and it's great. can never go wrong with oggi's sticks!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The new owners have done a great job changing the  atmosphere . Better music /food /service /.events  UFC fight Saturday was free and packed . So crazy!!!



Stopped in for happy hour! Great brews! Great service!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delivery guy is the worst. He even knows where my apartment is because he has gone there before, but depending on what he is doing or how his day is going - he makes me walk out to his car far away from my apartment. Stoned as hell. And expects a tip.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great place to eat. Why do we have to have the volume of the games so damn high. We aren't deaf. We are not in need of excess volumes of sports. Turn it down<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My coworker and I stopped in for lunch today and I ordered the pizza special. I asked for mushroom and pineapple, but my pizza came out with pepperoni and mushroom...no big deal, so I let the waitress know and she happily told me she would get it fixed. She came back a few minutes later with my pizza. It was completely piled with pineapple and mushroom and looked rather ridiculous. When I started eating it I noticed there were still remnants of pepperoni on my pizza. So basically, they picked off the pepperoni and tried to hide it with a bunch of toppings. I would think the cooks would have a little more pride in their food and not serve me such an embarrassing pizza. The waitress was nice and service was good, but I will not be back to this location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">While I cant really speak for the food.. I didn't get a chance to try it.

We arrived Thursday evening 5-19, to a almost full restaurant.. there was a birthday party going on in the back.

We checked in with the hostess, expecting to be sat right away as we saw two empty booths.. and one table waiting to be cleared..  but were told we would wait..   OK.

So, while waiting I was checking out the place.   Usually with busy restaurants.. you see waiters and or managers hustling about getting things done..  I saw hardly anyone!  I briefly saw one waiter in the bar area.. and he went back to the kitchen.. and popped out a couple times..  

For the dining area (where the two empty booths were), I rarely saw one waiter.   There was one chatting with the hostess, and did check one a table here and there..

So.. flash forward 25 minutes... we still haven't been sat.. there are still the two empty booths, and one table waiting to be cleared.  No tables either were vacated.

It is clear by watching the staff work.. that even if we did get sat.. the service would be horrible..  

The final straw.. was watching two bros stroll in and skip the now quite large crowd waiting for a table and go right to one of the two empty booths..  (that had been empty the entire time)

We got our parking validated and left... now to contact groupon to get a refund as we don't plan on returning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">On Saturday night me and the hubby ordered delivery first time through eat24. And weve never had oggies and we were excited to try something new. We ordered the cheesesticks, chicken tortilla soup, texas burger and cinnastix. Firstly everything was undercooked, the bread was undercooked for both cheesesticks and cinnasticks. I was so hungry i just ripped the cheese off but still got sick. My husband had the texas burger and the meat was undercooked and the bacon was overcooked. To say the least we speant the weekend in or around the toilet. And lastly the chicken tortilla soup, the chicken was wayyy too dry and overcooked. The broth was decent but overall terrible. This will be our first and last experience. Sadly im disappointed because i expected more from here. But please dont eat here because you will regret it and would have wasted money for shitty undercooked food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been coming here regularly with my dad and brother and we always leave happy and satisfied. They have amazing happy hour deals on pizza, wings, flatbreads, craft beers and wine. The pizza is really good! We love to order the pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the crust, cheese, and toppings are so delicious. I definitely recommend this place for a great happy hour deal!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I knew about Oggi's because this is the pizza that I see being served at Angel's Stadium. It always looked pretty good at the stadium but then again, what doesn't look good at the stadium. We had some time to kill before going to the baseball game so my boyfriend's family and I decided to stop by and grab an early dinner here before. It was pretty early so we had open seating and the service was excellent. Between the four of us, we ordered the Northshore Pizza, Slamdunk Pizza, and a small house salad. 

The house small salad was actually quite large. Could have made a meal out of that by itself for sure if you weren't too hungry. I enjoyed it but the croutons were definitely burnt. The pretzel twist it came with was a nice touch though. But who cares about the salad! It's all about the pizza! The Northshore (Hawaiian) pizza was pretty good. They were generous enough with the pineapples and used Canadian bacon instead of ham which was nice of them but the ratio was off. Not enough sauce for sure. Same thing with their Slamdunk (Buffalo Chicken) pizza. It had so much potential to be awesome but their ratio was completely off! Not enough cheese, or sauce or toppings for that matter. It was just DOUGH. TOO MUCH DOUGH EVERYWHERE. I'm paying you for the toppings, sauce, and cheese. Not the pizza dough. 

As far as pizza goes, it was just okay. I preferred the Northshore over the Slamdunk just because there was more on that pizza. It was just disappointing because I expected more out of Oggi's because the pizza always looked and smelled so good at the stadiums but looks can be deceiving. Pass! 3/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of my favorite sports places.  Varied menu and very good for the price.  Friendly staff and very accomodating.  Very near CSUF.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here several times and it keeps getting better and better. I've only tried their pizzas cause they're sooooo good, I haven't made the effort to try something different. So far, the BBQ Chicken (World Series)  and the Triathlon Pizza's are my go to's and they're amazing. Not only are the ingredients crazy good and fresh but the crust is tantalizingly delicious. I can't remember the last time I felt this way about Pizza crust. The service is definitely second to none. I'm craving the BBQ Chicken Pizza right now while I type this up. Ayayayyyyyyyy. The struggle of being a Foodie.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food, service, and happy hour. Have also experienced their delivery service, which is fast and convenient.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thursday night football! It's so nice to find a ace where we cab both watch & hear the game! The environment at Oggi's is so cozy, there are tons of comfy padded booths and high-back chairs at the bar tables.
   I counted about 10 tv's just in the bar, I would approximate between 42-55 inch screen sizes. They Re all crystal clear and can be seen from anywhere that you're sitting. There also tv's spread throughout the restaurant outside the bar area. 
   So far we've tried the pizza, thin crust & regular, both have been tasty. I loved the boneless 'killer' wings, the sauce was actually one of my favorites ever, very spicey but not mouth numbing. The side Cesar salad was great with shaved Parmesan and toasted croutons. I love that they have a Cal State Fullerton inspired cocktail called the 'Titan-Tini'- Ketel One vodka & blue curaçao with an orange twist ($9).  
   I'm sure this place is packed with college students on weekends since it's right at it's the steer from CSUF! Both times we've been here on Monday & Thursday the service has been good, along with the food and drinks. 
   Very important to note that there is parking   In the garage under the lofts, it cost $4 an hour during the week BUT OGGI'S VALIDATES parking so don't worry! :-D
  We'll be back! Sunday specials go all day, opening till 7pm! Woohoo<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm giving 2 stars only because I have nothing against oggis and enjoyed the food. The real issues that I had was with Kimberly I believe who is apparently the manager?? 

Me and a couple friends who, mind you are all bartenders and servers came in on Sunday evening. Haven't seen these friends in a little while so just wanted to have a beer some apps and chat. 

This is the thing I get it.... we all worked st pattys day and then probably had a rough weekend but there is no reason for the way she treated us. Not only was she completely absent when trying to order food but when we started to say "whenever you get a chance... She was just like hold on and walked away. 

Me and all my friends had just gotten off a long shift and could not believe how rude she was. We almost wanted to ask if she need some help because clearly the tables she had seemed to much to even smile. 

I don't know if Kimberly can remember my table because clearly her head was somewhere else but if she does just know that our 10% tip that we left you is truly never an acceptable tip in my eyes. I'll leave you 20% on average service and up from there so just want you to know you earned all 10%<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">From top to bottom...the staff, service and the beer selection was on point. The garlic knots are to die for. While we were there the owner was kind enough to come by our table to make sure we were all to the good!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Cant go wrong with the pizza here. A bit pricey, but worth it. The chicken salad was delicious and the wings were good. We had pick up, but the bar area looked cool.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Spoke with Daphne to place a Togo order and was informed I live to far away. I explained that my waze app indicated it was 3.2 (i live off Harbor and Bastanchury) and she said "um no your waze app is wrong" She also said its 5.2 miles and their radius is 5 miles. Kiddos for your lack of customer service !!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">phenomenal!!! Pass by this place all the time and finally stopped in. so glad we did because i couldn't stop eating what was in front of me (Grilled Vegetable Lasagna Roll Up) until my husband had to pack it up and carry it out of my sight.  So incredibly and amazingly good. I'm cramming leftovers in my face as i type this lol<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst customer service ever! Male bar tender in his thirties was extremely rude and refused to validate our "Angels Win!" digital coupon. He claimed he did not have to validate it because they "are not Little Cesars." Extremely rude bar tender, I ended up not ordering anything and leaving. Do yourself a favor and go to the location in Tustin. The Oggi's there is under different ownership, has much better customer service and they will validate your "Angels Win!" digital coupon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was cold and service was awful. I could of walked out without paying and no one would of noticed! No one in sight! Of course I didn't. They need to pay attention to their customers! First and last time here<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here last night and had a great night. It was easy to find parking in the parking structure and they validate so nothing to worry about. We got seated immediately. We ordered a couple things and they all tasted decent like any other typical American food chain. I did enjoy the World Series pizza a lot. Don't know if I would order the Texas burger or Oggi's Stix again. The sweet potato fries were also great. It was fast service and everyone was friendly. Had nice booth seats and plenty of tvs to watch sports. Will definitely be back here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We've been here a handful of times and all I can say is that service is average. Seems they cater to their regulars and everyone else seem to be less important. While the food is pretty good, and they've added some healthier options to their menu, it's still just ok. My husband does love their pizza though. And their beer is ok too. Tried the house wine and again, just ok. Not a bad place if you're hungry but don't expect too much or you will be disappointed. And a side note they did not honor the free offer on Yelp here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We came here on the 18th. Food is amazing and also got the pizza deal. Yeah! The location is super cool. I love their clear Windows. Plus 85 degree bread is next door!!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Enjoyed UFC 199 at Oggi's  only minimum 2 drinks to see the fight. The waitress and service was the best. The waitress was 
Jennifer she did nothing but smile when serving our table. 

I prefer Oggi's over Yard House  or Buffalo Wild Wings any day.  Come experience for yourself!!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went to Oggi's last night on the recommendation of a Cal State Fullerton student (who happened to work there, although not last night) nevertheless, we had good service good beer choices and very good eats. I had The three color Hummus dish with seasoned pita chips cucumbers and carrots to use as  chips as well. It was great to have something that tasted great and had no cholesterol I'm happy! Thx Kimberely.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place sucks. We ordered a medium pizza, a small order of wings, and one pitcher of beer...our total was $80. One pitcher of beer is $30! Insane. Never going back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not impressed. 

Salad lettuce was a weak shade of green, dressing was bland, 

Tortilla soup was just off and gross.  I won't be returning.

I am editing this to add that the server and service was excellent, I just wanted the quality of the food to match.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Gave it a try two times and both times they were under staffed. We ended up just leaving the second time after waiting for 30 minutes with no service.. Saw serval tables around not being served as well.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been here quite a few times now. The service is generally good. There have been several minor issues, but they will work to rectify them. The garlic knots... The ranch... I am powerless before those. I actually refer people to Oggi's just for their knots. My coworker went for the reference and enjoyed them thoroughly as well. Pizza is bomb as well. Very good food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It has been several years since we have been to an Oggi's location as my wife was not a big fan of their food during our previous encounters (2 separate locations).  I was recently gifted a Groupon however for this location and after a failed attempt to use another Groupon we were looking at due to the restaurant being closed on Sundays we figured we would make our way over.

Parking can be found in the adjacent parking structure (free on weekends) but is only free for a half hour normally and then skyrockets in price to a ridiculous rate of $4 for 31 minutes to the first hour.  God knows we would have been here longer than that just to get acknowledged.

As we walked in the place was busy as the Women's World Cup was about to come on.  After approving to sit in the bar section we were quickly ushered to a booth in the back corner near the wall of televisions.  As we sat and began to peruse the menu, all the other surrounding booths filled in the televisions were all changed to the upcoming soccer game.  After figuring out what I wanted to eat, I had looked down at my watch and realized we had been here for over 15 minutes without so much as an acknowledgment from a server let alone a drink order being placed.  

At this point the soccer game was in full swing, the crowd was getting ruckus and the staff swapped the sound from the television across the way to the screen directly above my wife.  2 goals into the game and you were completely deaf.  Another 10 plus minutes had gone by and still no server to be found.  As I looked around I noticed that all 3 other booths seated after us had drinks and servers coming to the tables to take orders.  The large table next to us (party of 9) also was being helped as we sat here twiddling our thumbs without so much as a greeting.  After nearly a half hour of nothing we decided to get up and simply walk out.  I can honestly say I do not remember a time in my life where I have been ignored so completely at a restaurant that I had to walk out but this was completely unacceptable.

If not for the pending Groupon, I would NEVER return to this location again.  Unfortunately for us, the Groupon we have is ONLY good for this fabulous location whose service is horrendous.  At this point, I am half tempted to simply let the Groupon lapse than to ever return to this location again and waste more time out of my life.  Eat here at your own risk but I recommend doing your homework and making sure no major sporting event is on and to definitely not sit in the bar section as you will be forgotten about.  This is definitely one of those time I wish Yelp would implement a ZERO star rating.

The only plus for the night was the delicious In & Out Burger for saving the day and finally allowing us the food and beverage we so craved.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">idk if its for my brown skin or because  i look like a mexican first and last time i come  here. Had to argue  and wait for a free drink that the owner said it was on him. Just charge me and dont make me wait on my drink for 1 hr daaam not even buffalo wild wings. DONT WAIST YOUR TIME. ALSO THE WAITER WAS RUDE TGE HOLE TIME SMFH<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Vegetarian pizza is outstanding.   Tons of fresh vegetables and great size.   The price is kind of high but well worth it when you see all of the fresh vegetables.    

Caesar salad was very good and a great size.  Nice and fresh with tasty croutons.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great pizza even better garlic knots! A must try if your in the mood for quality pizza and some beer.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food...and Jazmine was a great server. It was busy and under staffed...but she was extremely helpful and kind!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food, great drinks and great service. A must if you are in the area. The pizza is great with all their house brewed beers and wings go great with the pizza as well. First time but won't be my last time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great pizza, great beer selection. However they took the double ipa off any specials for happy hour and day specials.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Our server was Kayla. She was very accommodating and helpful re our special order because of my daughter's food allergies. We were seated promptly, received great service and we were all happy with our food. Thank you to the kitchen staff too for accommodating our special requests.

They have a wide variety of food to choose from. Extra plus is 85 degrees is located next door ;) will definitely be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oggi's new owner Steve makes everyone feel welcome and the food is outstanding. There is a wide variety of food to satisfy all:  soups, salads, pizza, fish, burgers, pasta and desserts. Great place for families, office or school meetings, team gatherings. Love their private yet open feeling room for larger parties.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went on Saturday night and was very impressed. Great vibes in the place they have plasmas everywhere perfect place to watch a game. Also Brooke gave us great service very polite and quick to get us refills. The food was great and the beer was cold overall satisfied will be back soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Friday night the place was packed. 
Congrats to the new owners creating a new atmosphere their hard work is paying off! service and food was outstanding . I recommend the Oggis special pizza with avocados added, it's delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had a great time at Oggis Friday. This was my first time and I will definitely be back. Outstanding happy hour...try the Oggis blond beer, coldest beer in town for sure!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had the best experience at this location. The staff and manager were super nice place and I got a  free "small" Oggi's Stix just for checking in... Score!

It was Halloween, and we wanted to watch the Ducks vs Dallas hockey game, and the place wasn't very busy (yet).  So I asked if I could change the game to the big TV.  Not only did the manager change the station, he cranked up the volume, AND switched 2 smaller TV's.

We ordered a bunch of happy hour food (HH ends at 7 pm) and the food came out hot and fresh.

I couldn't find any fault in my visit.  Parking was free, food was tasty, and the Ducks won in overtime.  That's a hat trick in my book!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like to frequent this spot around UFC Fight Night because the atmosphere and the quality of the food is unlike any Sports bar in the area. Usually when I am here I order the Guacamole Bacon Burger which is absolutely delicious and very filling even for a big guy. The staff are also very friendly and vibrant people if you have the chance to speak with them. The only issue that I've found here is the waiting time for the food, which is not too big of a deal because when you do taste the food it makes it all worth the wait. Overall the service, food, price, and environment in Oggi's is great. I would recommend eating here 8/10.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We came here Sunday night just before closing.  Our server, Kayla, was very bubbly and attentive.  Despite our late arrival she didn't rush us at all.  The pizza was fresh and delicious...really good cheese, and not greasy!  We will definitely be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Jasmine was our server she is an awesome lady she took care of our needs and thank you for the great service<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Drove down to Fullerton to check out Oggi's for a friends birthday since another friend found a groupon deal. As soon as we walked in we were greeted pretty rudely. Note, it wasn't busy at all. As we entered we told them we weren't sure if our party was here yet and the host said there is self seating over there (points to bar) ..we were like okay? Once we realized our party wasn't there we asked for a table and they said pointing "there are tables over there" so we found a table and sat. We asked a question about the groupon deal and our waitress barely answered it and kept asking what we wanted. Once the rest of our party arrived they asked another question about the groupon deal and she said "I already explained it to your friends, what do you want?" I asked for a beer on the menu and she said "we don't have that beer right now, what do you want" I asked if she could give us a couple mins because I needed time away from all her rudely delivered pressure. We decided to take the loss of the already purchased groupon and go eat somewhere where we can actually enjoy my friends birthday. Best decision made all day. 

BTW I go to CSUF right up the street and will make sure to avoid this spot for the remainder of my college years.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We came and had dinner here the other night. Service was amazing. I had the Calzone and my friend had the Chicken Alfredo, they were both great ! Magi and Kayla were both very attentive and sweet. All in all service was amazing! We will definitely be coming back!  Love love love love!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great pizza, atmosphere, and service!! Can't get any better. Taylor was great as well. She's fortunately a Lakers fan. They other server is not as fortunate being a Clippers fan.. The owner is also really nice. Also with a check in a yet you get a free small desert. Super delicious

The best part of the whole experience is definitely the food. Service is good.. Could be better but not too bad for a college place. My only complaint is seeing no one at the hostess stand. I'm cool but some customers expect those things<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Diverse menu, great staff very attentive, If so please send me your email, cell & bday THANK YOU so much I am grateful for your willingness to help me out! You're in a hurry they get you in and out. Beer a great selection of micro brews! Parking is good and lots of locals come in<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you can get over the snotty hostess you are on your way to the most overpriced, low quality food available. Wings were decent, philly was microwaved, pizza was pretty good ($14.00 for an individual pizza), lettuce wraps ($12.99) ok. Beware they charge you out the hooha for pepperoncini....$3.50 for a grand total of 9. I could have driven to the store and bought a huge jar for that amount of money. $15.99 for a wack philly cheese steak and fries? C'mon! Don't waste your time. Lots of great restaurants in this neighborhood.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Stereotypical sports bar with pizza so nothing that pops out here to me but the set up here is nice.  They have a great beer menu and prices are reasonable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't Yelp that often, but I have found a place that really stands out. I've been coming to OGGI's since the new owners have taken over. I've always been blown away by the quality of the ingredients, the daily homemade dough ..it all makes for a Great tasting pizza.
The Fullerton OGGI's location is a great location for me. It's right off the Freeway and has great structure parking. They even validate the parking!!  I stopped in on Sunday after the Angel's won. $5 for a 14" one topping pizza is a GREAT Deal.... It fed our whole Family!!
I also took advantage of the new $5 Super Sunday Bloody Mary (keep the glass) promotion.  Another outstanding deal.  This is also one of the few places that offer all the MLB games on their 40 TV's.
OGGI's pizza in my opinion is a top notch pizza and to top it off they have a killer selection of great tasting beers.  This is by far one of the best pizzas I've had in my life and in my opinion it is the best pizza in Orange County! 
I would encourage everyone to try this place out.... You will not be disappointed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was good. We had a large group and they handled it very well.  Manager and waitress were very friendly even though we were kind of a loud group. Thank you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When we arrived for a late lunch to the Oggi's in Fullerton yesterday I looked at my Yelp app and wondered why a great place like Oggi's would have only 3 stars.

Now I know... and I'll echo those sentiments. Now, it's not like I was outraged by anything that happened during my hour or so in this establishment - but c'mon, Oggi's, step up your game.

We walked in through the back door (near the parking lot) and approached the vacant host stand. There were not many people dining - and there weren't many employees around. I think I saw a floor manager, two servers, and a busser... and maybe one other person behind the bar... this is at 2pm on a Sunday during March Madness (and a pretty exciting soccer match, it seemed).

We got seated promptly... and were led to a booth. The woman who sat us dropped off menus and left - and we were then able to clean the crumbs off the seats of our own booth, how lovely!

After a few moments a woman came to take our order. We began with soft drinks and garlic knots (my fave!) and then she went away to put in the order. The drinks came out quickly - then the knots... and we ordered. A medium pizza, a wrap, a personal pizza, and a side of fries. Nothing too complicated, eh?

She forgot straws... not a huge deal. We flagged her down a moment later.

The first course went well - though our server wasn't particularly attentive... it was cool... we are, after all, fairly low maintenance.

Hey! Here comes the food! The lady who sat us was also running food... okay... thanks!  We told her we were still waiting on a side of fries. She told us she'd check on them. Cool... I guess.

But... I'd like some plates for my pizza. And some napkins. And forks. And some ketchup (for the fries that came with the wrap my wife ordered, you guys, not for my pizza - I'm not some weirdo).

Well... then everybody started ignoring us. So, after a minute I just walked up to the host stand and grabbed some plates and napkins. ::sigh::

We began to eat - still no side of fries. A few minutes later the server comes by and I ask... she says she forgot to ring them in. They'll be another five minutes.

"Can we have some ketchup, please?" "Oh, of course!"

Now, we're all set... we enjoy our food. It's pretty tasty (it is Oggi's, after all).

The manager brings out the side of fries - finally! He says nothing about the delay. He doesn't ask about our experience. He simply says, "Side of fries?" And leaves them - and goes on his merry way.

We got some boxes - paid the bill (and tipped, don't worry) - and left. The whole experience was lackluster... and it is no wonder it was so empty in there. If I'm gonna pay 19 bucks for a medium 2-topping pizza I expect more than a bunch of forgetful staff members and having to clean my own booth and get my own plates... I'll go for DiGiorno.

But, hey, lots of TVs!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just had the Wimbledon and boy was it amazing! My husband and I are new to the area and were looking for some pizza and beer. Clean, modern and perfectly cooked pizza. Nice variety of beer on tap. Friendly service- Kim the bartender was super sweet. Will definitely return!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have no interest in sports or brews, but I do like pizza and my friends so I came here with them.
Having been to a few others Oggi's and not loving it, I went with what they ordered, a large meat pizza and a few rounds of drinks.
It is super noisy in here, not really great for having a conversation.
Also super full, expect a wait.
Expect to wait even longer for your food. I know a big pizza takes time and it was huge, but we waited about 45 minutes, a solid 15-20 for drinks, refills we had to flag down.
Prices are high for the quality, server could not care less about their guests, I'll pass next time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for mondays happy hour and Kim was behind the bar. I don't come here often but I'm probably going to become a regular here. She was super friendly and accommodating and just a genuine person.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We came in yesterday after leaving the Angels game a little early. Oggis runs a special where if the Angels win then the next day you can get a dine in medium 1 topping pizza for $5. Kind of a ridiculously awesome special. There were 5 of us. 2 of which are young loud children. Normally I wouldn't have even gone but I was kind of along for the ride. We ordered a pepperoni and water all around. I can't believe there isn't some kind of minimum. The kids were loud and messy but our waitress was very polite and friendly. The kids were also given crayons and coloring paper. The food came out quickly. Our waitress was attentive. Before we left she was even talking with my niece about her favorite Disney princess. I think the waitress said hers was Bell from Beauty and the Beast. Very friendly calm atmosphere. Can't ask for anymore. I won't necessarily be coming back with the girls but they had some good drink specials I'll be back for. If only the Angels can win once in awhile.
Thank you<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Shouts to the empty glass, why they make you like that? ?!

Sculpin on the tap, grade A class.

A pint to start the day, says I'm on my way..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just had a great experience. The manager personally came by to greet us and our waitress, Cosmo, was excellent. Love the selection of craft beer, multiple TVs, flat bread pizza, and THE WINGS. We had the sweet Thai and teriyaki wings for an appetizer and they were devoured in record time. This is the perfect place to pre-game for the Angels game. 
I'll see you soon Oggi's<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We came here after a soccer tournament, remembering how good Oggi's in Huntington Beach used to be. Pizza was good, service just ok. What really was disappointing is that even though the restaurant punched the parking ticket, it did not validate and we ended up paying full price for the parking. Disappointing overall :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place. Our softball teams go in every Tuesday and Thursday and we have an absolute blast. All of the employees are friendly and treat us extremely well. Jasmin, Maggie, Samantha, Jen, James (bartender), and Reuben are AWESOME! They do get busy and as anyone would know that has worked in the industry, sometimes service suffers slightly but they always make it right. 

Pizza, Burgers, Flatbreads, Lasagna, and Oggi Sticks are great. I've had them all and they are great! Excellent beer selection and the Cinnamon Oggi Stix are phenomenal!

I just feel that people need to understand that when it is busy the employees are stretched thin. I feel like they do their best and that people should be more understanding of the situation.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst place to go for a game or ufc fight!! I had a review written up and they paid to remove it, which was really pathetic! Went on the day of the Diaz fight, called in for reservations and when I got there they had given my table away and we had to wait for another one! We sit down and nobody acknowledged us, after 20 min I spoke up and it turned out to the the owner! He apologized and said first round on him as we were all there for their flight of beers! Waitress laughed about it and told the owners wife that we actually expected a free flight, sorry that that's really the only thing I order from there, we are not freeloaders! Her demeanor and attitude changed every time she came around our table. 30 min later we got a drink, 50 min of sitting there and all we got was a beer!  Best Customer service award goes to!!! Food was okay, with that shitty service was enough for me to never step foot in a place that I once loved!! I would give them no stars but that's not an option!! Never stepping foot in here, they are a joke!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review is only for happy hour. Came in on a thursday around 5pm, got seated right away in the bar area and got service right away. The server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the specials. They had well drinks and beer for around $4 and they also had flat breads and pizza for around $6. Overall good happy hour.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wife and I wanted to try something new so we gave Oggis a go.    We had it delivered.  We ordered the beef sliders, italian quesadilla, a sandwich and the loaded fries.  I found this to be  more of the same mediocre food that is common to Southern California.  Wife says the sliders were dry and tasteless.  The italian quesadilla was terrible,   one bite and I trashed it.  The sandwich was average, but edible.  The loaded fries were anything but loaded.  The portion size is reasonable for the price.  Definitely is what I would consider to be bar quality food.  To be fair, everything I ordered was from the appetizer list, so I wont damn the rest of the menu.  The appetizers alone will keep me from ordering from here in the future.  If you can't get the appetizers right how great can the other food be?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was just driving around fullerton n wanted some pizza n watch the hockey game. when i walked in the game was not showing on the tvs but when i asked if they will be showing it they said very friendy we are now n changed it. order me a pizza with ex cheese it came out great n fast. the dough was perfect not to soft or burnt and man did they pack on the ex cheese. loved it. They have a great selection of beers on tap and in the bottle. The workers were very friendly every time they walked by they would just ask is everything okay if I need anything.  definitely a place I will be coming back too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As of late, been coming here to watch the NBA and NHL playoffs. I like the amount of tvs and the fact that its my first time experiencing Oggi's, I was immediately intrigued with the atmosphere. 

Pretty decent happy hour. 
Mediocre food and beers on tap. 
Would not recommend the wings. Frozen is actually better.
Pizza is disappointing. Too much dough. Lacks flavor.
Plenty of sitting and comfortable.
Patio sitting available. 
Service is annoying. Both my visits, I thought it could've been way better.


I probably wouldn't come back if there was no 1) sports game I want to watch or 2) not happy hour time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Stopped by on Saturday to check this place out ... they happened to be showing the UFC fight and had no cover charge which is always a plus. The food and atmosphere were great!  We tried the wings and they were delicious. Definitely coming back soon!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Short-n-Sweet: Brand New as of Late 2013!  Loads of TVs, large menu, plenty of craft beer!  Dependable!!

Listed in: "Quench your Craftyness", "Spaces for Spectators"

Story Time: So I know all about the Oggi's chain.  I had a birthday gathering at one, I have watched a superbowl at another, and I even have organized a fundraiser at this particular location.

I was very excited to host a fundraiser here for a non-profit I'm involved with called L'Arche Wavecrest (www.larchewavecrest.org) which helps people with developmental disabilities.  Granted, it wasn't a cake walk since I only had one week to confirm it, and then I had to get flyers sent to the appropriate people.  There are consistently lots of waiting times with almost any restaurant I deal with, so Oggi's lack of rapid communication wasn't anything new.  BUT, I did appreciate that the GM did speak to me on the phone a couple of times!!  That, my friends, is rare.  Usually the associate managers are the ones in charge.  So, already I felt I was having a good experience. 

The atmosphere itself is gorgeous for a sports bar!!! They have plenty of natural lighting which helped the place to not look like a bar.  The booths and tables and surrounding woodwork went well together giving the place a sleek contemporary look.  They also did well in being a sports bar by offering a load of TVs, and the bar area had an even larger TV to watch whatever prime game was on.

The food was slighty on par with BJs and Yardhouse.  They do offer loads of options here, so you don't have to feel stuck with Burgers, Pizza, or other bar inspired foods.  But, as I told my friend who had the Cobb Salad, veggies are not always going to be done well at sportbar themed restaurants.  Maybe Yardhouse, but they're exceptional in general.  Four of us had different pizzas, and all of us loved them.  A couple of us had the Guacamole Hamburger, and were very satisfied.  A few of us had other dishes, and walked away full and happy.

Their craft beer is now mostly made by a company called Left Coast Brewering....at least that's what Left Coast claims:  http://www.leftcoastbrewing.com/about/left-coast-brewing-co  So it's delicious stuff.  BUT, if you are interested in trying out local craft, they also offer that as well, I think moreso than BJs does!!!  Too bad Oggi's is not anxious to promote the other beer so they don't list it.  Actually they would have more customers if they announced their guest beers because some of them were fantastic options, like their Hanger 24 offerings and some from San Diego breweries.

The service was not so bad as other reviews mention.  This place is new and they seem to be working out the kinks just fine.  We were a massive group, so our food was going to take longer, I grant that.  A couple of side salads were forgotten, and that was not the end of the world.  What I really appreciated was that the place split up the work, and our group server wasn't the only one handling the entire eating area, which by the way, was small.  It ended up being a manageable load for our server, especially since we came just as the rush of the dinner crowd came.  Literally 5 tables of people were filled as we began ordering.  It was nothing less than crunch time for the servers tonight.

All in all, it was a win-win situation!!  I am grateful that Oggi's was able to help support my non-profit immediately and not have to go through many hoops of "Corporate."   I also believe I have made them a few new fans for future visits.

Bravo, Oggi's.  Keep it up, and you'll get some more 4 star reviews soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is good here - and their beer is "every day drinking" good.

The hamburgers are tasty and juicy - don't miss the other items on the menu.

They have a good selection of beers, but their house brew is perfectly serviceable, none of these weird adjuncts that some places get carried away with (Yes, I am looking down the road to you Placentia).

We usually get a medium pizza, some garlic knots, and a few beers - just right!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">the managers Kathy and Steve were and continuously are always very nice to me and my friends! we live in the UHs and didn't know that we got 20% off every visit! The food is always so good and the service is even better. I never do reviews but I have to for this restaurant because the owners are just so kind and do everything they can to make the Customers happy! Kathy was very welcoming to us, I will continue to go to this restaurant for all my food cravings!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza, beer, salad and dessert!  Plus great service.  Never had any problems here.  Nothing but good people. Come check Oggi's out.  New owner is a really nice guy!  Say hi to Kymm and Magi !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried out their delivery!

Hubby and I wanted pizza.  We had just moved, I had come back home after a full day's work, and I was cranky because of traffic (f*ck the Orange Crush!  T_T  ).  Bartender hubby made me a strong drink, so I proceeded to get a bit tipsy (keyword: tipsy.  NOT drunk).  Then, he made me another drink.  And then a third.  So, of course, I started getting the munchies and, unfortunately, we didn't have any food in our new place because we just moved in.  I was, of course, in no mental state to drive, and hubby was pretty tired, too, so he decided to have someone just delivery pizza.

Checked out all of the local pizzerias on Yelp.  Promptly threw out Pizza Hut and Papa John's.  Tried looking at a few local ones, and decided on Oggi's (don't worry, we'll have plenty of time to try the other local pizza joints).  Hubby ordered online, got pizza and wings, paid online, we waited around 30 or 40 minutes, heard a doorbell, went down, tipped the delivery person, brought the pizza up to what should have been our dining area, sat down, and proceeded to munch.

Hubby wanted me to mention that the delivery guy was very polite and cordial.  We dig good service!

All of the foods were piping hot.  The wings were a very good size for the price, and were pretty tasty.  Had a nice kick to it, and the meat was tender enough where you got most of the meat off easily.  Also, the messier it is, the better it is.

The pizza was huge.  We got a meat lover's version, but added jalapenos and red onions.  Jalapenos were FRESH, so we had heartburn the next morning.  But, the dough wasn't bad, the toppings were pretty fresh, and the portions were good.  A little bit pricier than what we normally would pay for a pizza, but it wasn't bad.  

May try it out again, but we're on the search for our go-to pizza place, so this place may have to be kicked out of our list.  I wouldn't mind dining in, though.  Their original place in Orange was great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried to order a salad on a slow day. I was one of only 5 tables.  25 minutes later and still no salad.  I had to leave to get back to work.  i'll never wast my time coming here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food: good, get the pizza. Pasta is average. Good selection of beer.

Service: excellent, Jasmine the manager was very attentive and super nice. 

Ambiance: good for late night, beer and tv. Not too loud. Clean.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Stopped by tonight on our way home from my boyfriends worked to watch the kings game.  Busy, but everyone was support attentive. Meet the owners and they were super sweet and willing to help if we needed anything. Oggi's pizza was super yummy and the beer was nice and cold.  We will return with friends and family.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered a pound of the traditional buffalo wings and medium 10" works pizza.  Total was around $25 - overpriced for what you got.
The wings were dry.  How can you mess up wings?
The pizza was ok.  Nothing special.  Really, nothing special.
Service was average.  There's something with Oggi's.  We went to the one in Tustin by our house and we weren't impressed with the food or service.  Four years ago and we still haven't returned to that location and will not return to this one either.  Food, service and prices need to be improved.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Oggi's and certainly find this one to be one of the best. We always get served by this AMAZING server by the name of Taylor. My friend and I come here regularly and at times I feel really bad for her being that she has to serve so many customers all at once at times.  I hope Management reads this review and get Taylor help, at least during lunch time. I get it, it's all about profits and revenue and decrease in expenses, but it can hinder customer experience. Especially those who doesn't understand it's not the servers fault.  I want to definitely compliment Taylor for her professionalism and keeping it so cool. We witnessed a large group literally asked poor Taylor to split all their bills while customers after customers are walking in. Holy cow! is what I thought to myself. After what I witnessed, I had to write a review for her.  In addition, I don't want people to be turned off by their 3 stars rating, cause I think it's not fair. Oggi's has great foods and great pricing. If you haven't try it, you're missing out. Just have to go in with an open mind and be patience with the servers. You will enjoy it, I promise.

Service: Taylor, you are AWESOME! 10 STARS/5
Food: 5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Pricing: 5/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The new owners have made a world of difference. Friday afternoon I received a text message from my sister's boyfriend. "Guess what? I'm sitting at Oggi's, drinking a beer, and dealing with a nice bartender." When you consider my earlier review which detailed how I had tried to visit on three separate occasions and couldn't get any service, this was a really surprising text.  After work, I joined him for a drink. Every employee I passed, even one on her break, acknowledged me and everyone else they passed by. Our service was friendly, but not intrusive, knowledgeable without being condescending; the perfect level of involvement without being overly engaged. Driving by later in the evening, we noticed it was more crowded than we had ever seen this location. I think the "new ownership" sign is prompting others to give the place a second chance also.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oggis, best pizza, best brews, best service, nothing left to say‼ we go often and plan on going back soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place! Just went here for the first time about a month ago and have been there three times since. They had a really cool promotions during the baseball season where if the Angels won you could get a large pizza for $5 which was pretty awesome! The service is usually always really good but sometimes could take a while. The food is always superb here and the beer is cold! They have really good happy hour specials and everything I've tried thus far has been bomb. 

You can park under the lofts and Oggi's will validate for you! They have lots of TV's and beers to choose from. Wonderful atmosphere and very family friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love love love coming to Oggis. Always get great food and service. I've never had to wait long even on their busiest nights. We are always treated like family. If you like spinach and goat cheese, they have the best salad. The wings are the bomb. Flat breads are amazing. Pasta is premiere. They have a diverse menu and decent added some new items. We started coming when they first opened because they are close to home, but became hooked. This is our go to place now because of the friendly service and great food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Light thick and airy. Just how I like it:) probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Will def come back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place! The food options and beer selection are great! The staff is really fun and friendly!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If I could give this place 0 stars I would !!! What a complete rip off !!! 30$ for a pitcher of beer !!! Never again will we be back here !!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We came to oggis for the first time. We got the lunch special. I got an individual pizza and my fiancé got a sun fired tomato chicken wrap. The food was good but it was our sever jennifer that made the stop much more enjoyable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You have got to eat at Oggis.   Omg the pizza is to die for.  And Cosmo is even better.  She's cute, funny and  a all around a great person. Trust me.  The Oggis special Pizza is the  ticket.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't know why I'm giving them a two star waited for over 75 minutes for our food and when we got it didn't get what we were told, very disappointed paid for a pound of wings and received 5 pieces that's not a pound!!!!! And the Pizza we ordered was not extra sausage how can you keep Customers it you don't take care of them?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food and service. Pizza was amazing. Staff are friendly.  I would recommend stopping by if in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First timer, the staff was great and the atmosphere was great. The pizza was good and they had great beer on tap. Left the place with a smile, I will actually go back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This was my first time here at Oggi's and my friend and I decided to try this place out because we found a groupon for it.  The food here was really good. I got the Baja 500 burger. Its technically a sandwich on their menu possibly because it's a chicken breast instead of a beef patty, but I still consider it a burger. (:  It was a huge portion with a side of seasoned fries. Delicious and worth it for the price.  I love spicy food so this was a big plus for me.  The giant beer mug that I got was refreshing and delicious too.  I believe it was the Paradise Pale Ale.  I dont usually drink pale ales but this one was good.  

What didn't do it for me this trip was the service.  We sat at the bar and trying to find our waitress the entire time we were there after she took our food orders was a mission in itself.  It wasn't particularly busy at the time, but she just kinda disappeared from view a lot.  On top of everything else, she also had a really bad attitude.  It wasn't like we were loud or rowdy.  We were pretty quiet and kept to ourselves but she just seemed like us being there was a huge inconvenience for her.   The only times she was nice to us was when we first got there and after we paid possibly because she saw that we tipped her more than 20% on an almost $70 tab (and that was including the groupon).  I would come back but maybe if there was a different bartender...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been coming here for a little while now. James is my favorite bartender! They are under new ownership now and making great changes and promotions!!! My favorite dishes are the tequila chicken pasta and any of the flat bread pizzas.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really like the atmosphere here. It's nice, open, light. The food is pretty good and the prices are fair.

However, the service leaves much to be desired. I felt as though our waitress disliked us, she was not very friendly until we tipped her more than the allotted 20%. I had to get my own plate for a friend because she didn't check in on us often enough.

Food is 4, service is 2.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The waiters serve extremely slow like those sloths in zootopia. The pizzas and pastas are awesome and the price is reasonable. Restaurant is clean and each table has enough rooms.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came out here on a Thursday night, ordered a flat bread from their happy hour menu. I found a hair on my plate and when told my server he said it could've been an arm hair or something like that, said he "didn't know where the hair came from so he would give me a 20% discount"  I got a $1.70 off of an $8 dollar plate! Will never go back... I had already purchased a few beers and additional plates, and the best they could do was 20% off of that flatbread for having a hair in my food. Disgusting right?? Not even an apology!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thee most amazing service for sure this is the place to get super cold beer absolutely amazing<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is cool to watch a game and chill with friends. They have plenty of T.V's. Their pizza is good along with their tasty fries. I love the burgers and buffalo sliders.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We had a medium Oggi's Special Pizza and the Mediterranean Salad. Both items were delicious and that is why we return to Oggi's.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A local favorite. Good beer. Great food. Amazing servers that treat us like family. Will continue going every week like we have for the past two years.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service - waitress was friendly, affordable prices, and A great selection of draft beers.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very bad service.  Seems like when they noticed I was annoyed that they finally asked if I needed something.  By the way they were doing things to kill time or to look busy rather then ask what we wanted to order to make money.  Just weird.  You have guys sitting at the bar and you don't ask what they want you would rather have them sit there and waste space.  Its busy in here but not that busy.  No waits or lines at the door.  So can you explain this one?  I can't sorry.  After today.  Never ever again.  I'm still waiting for my pizza.  I might just walk out.  Super annoyed.  The guy next to me that came 30 min after me got his food before me.  Fuck this stupid place.  They will go out of business.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">95% of the time service and food is exceptional. They have a decent quantity of beer with their own brews and awesome pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pricey for mediocre pizza.  Pizza Press is a much better place. I wasnt impress w the pizza.  Prob won't come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Epic fail.  TV froze up,  just missed the first goal of the Ducks game. Not going back to watch sports there again. Beer was good,  too bad...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am running into a sting of bad service at restaurants these days.  Oggi's is next on the list. 

It was a slow day and it took forever for the food to come out and 10 minutes for a scoop of ice cream?!   And the excuse I got was that there "were a lot of orders before you". Seriously?  Was the ice cream line that long?  :-)

Anyhow, frustrated only because the service was slow and the excuse. The food was good... Average bar type restaurant food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My boyfriend and I have been coming here once a week for the past 6 months and we've never had a bad experience. The staff has been so friendly right from the start and now, being regulars, the whole team of employees, even the assistant manager who treats us like her own sons, refers to us as "The Boys"... Has a nice ring to it. We really feel like family here. If you can, ask for Jazmine, Maggy, Jenna, or Christina. They're our favorites and always treat us with the best service. Wonderful food as well, best pizza and wings I've ever had and for a reasonable price too. Burgers? Great! Loaded fries? Amazing! Don't pass up this gem, it's my favorite!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">what happened??? change in management or what?? This place used to be a new family favorite, but over the last few weeks it's turned into more work than it's worth. Terrible service. Food doesn't arrive, follow-up and nothing but attitude. Food finally arrives and it's pretty bad. My portabelle mushroom was just not edible. So sad to cross this place off our family list. Boo!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been frequenting this location for several years and have ordered a wide array of both libations, and food. I have yet to be disappointed. Kymm, jazz, Ben, and Bryce are the bartenders I have encountered and have been consistently enthused to take my order, while ensuring that I am satisfied. Maddi, Cosmo, Christina, and Jen have always taken my order in a timely fashion, and accurately. I am perplexed at previous reviews that called into question the service, because I have always been highly satisfied with it. Their chicken tequila pasta dish is the best thing ever invented by humans, and I dare you to tell me otherwise.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Took two hours to get delivered to me and its in not edible. Wast of $50. Never again<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great happy hour, good food, and attentive staff. I heard that the owners changed recently it is a little different atmosphere than when I came in before. The food is great (hot and tasted great) I had a pep and feta pizza from the lunch special. and the waitress was very attentive and checked back frequently. Made sure I had ever condiment and even asked if i wanted ranch or hot sauce. I also ordered a drink it came quickly and wasn't watered down. All and all a good visit. Would definately come again when I am in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great location, nice look, reasonably prices but, unfortunately, has bad service. They aren't rude by any means but they don't pay attention, they're slow and they don't seem to be improving. We came here when they opened and the service was slow and our order was wrong. They made it right by comping one of the meals. We've been there since several times and our order is always wrong and the service is just as bad. The portions have also gotten smaller by it could be because they're in a college area and the prices are pretty good so the positions need to be reflective of that. I feel bad for them because it's such a good looking place but the service has to improve. Not sure if it's the waitresses and the cook or just the waitresses but there needs to be change if they're going to appeal to more than just college students.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is greattttt!!!! Beer is delicious. Super nice place big screen TV'S playing sports, nice chill environment. And very nice waitresses<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitly a good place to stop by if you're looking for a lighter meal.  Selection was a bit limited, but quality was pretty good.  Manager and staff were very nice and welcoming.  I used a Local Flavor deal and was very pleased.  I would visit again...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We love their spicy BBQ wings. We recently tried the free order of cinnamon twists for dessert. Man!!! Addicting!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When I was driving by Cal State Fullerton, I noticed they finished the construction on the plaza on Commonwealth. To my surprise, there's now a sports bar in that plaza that my friends and I can go to after they're done with class. Oh how fast that excitement diminished after my first visit.

Lets just get this out of the way. Both the times I've gone to Oggi's, the service was horrid. From the vibe I've gotten from them, its as if they don't even want to work there. Rude and non attentive, I didn't even receive my water that I ordered at the beginning until the end of out meal. The table next to us didn't even get a menu to look at until they got fed up and grabbed it themselves. Our server in particular was hovering and talking to a table next to us, but when she was done, ran to the back without giving us any attention. When we had to resort to saying "excuse me" to get her to come to us after the third time. After we got her attention, she stopped walking, slowly spun around, and replied with an annoyed face, "yes?". Right there I was ready to walk out but my friends wanted to start and watch the games on the many TVs in the restaurant...the ONLY good thing. I can go on and on about the service but that means I'll be spending more time describing the service itself than the actual service I received.

Now for the food...

The sliders I've ordered were dry dry dry. Here is the description of my Beef Sliders from the menu: " Ground Angus Beef seasoned with our own special seasoning, tooped with crispy onion strings and American cheese". I wish I took a picture of the amount of these that was in the Sliders I received. If I didnt look closely, I could've guessed there were none. The bread and beef itself was just too dry and tasteless I couldn't finish start on the second slider. Seasoning? What seasoning? The extra salt and pepper I had to add in which was still not enough? Yeah...stay away from these.

The wings? I'll keep this one short...overcooked. Frozen wings taste better.

Garlic Knots? Like everything else, dry and tasteless. Sure they're pig huge portions. But if i wanted to eat cooked dough I would've ordered that instead. There was barely any garlic butter on the Knots. Dont believe me, look at the picture I posted

The pizza, like the sliders, was also dry and I don't understand why they would use so much dough and not enough sauce. Is this a way for them to justify the price? We ordered a 14" of the Oggi's special and man was there a lot of crust. Im sure I could make a few more slices with the amount of dough they wasted on the crust. Maybe if they gave a side of marinara sauce to dip the large and dry crust in, it would be more bearable. Hell, Little Caesars, Costco, and Digiorno cheese pizza have more flavor and a perfect ratio between bread and crust then Oggi's regular pizza. If I ever get dragged back here and forced to order a pizza yet alone their food, I'll be sure to get the thin crust.

Nothing makes me want to come back here. Yes they have a lot of TV's and they play any game you want, but I rather just watch them at home and enjoy better food from the freezer isle.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow.... I have never written a review on yelp before, but with the service I received here I had to. I came here with my husband on a Sunday afternoon and sat down in the cocktail area. It was moderately busy and we waited over 15 minutes and no one greeted us. My husband went so far as to go to the bar to order us some beers, to which he waited another five minutes with no help. The server finally came towards us but he started taking to his friends who were seated well after my husband I sat down. Since there was no service,  I walked out of the restaurant. 

Let's keep this simple, don't go here unless you want to have terrible service. My husband and I have been here quite a few times, but sadly we won't be returning to this location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza... Oh yeah
Burgers... More please!
Onion rings...keep 'em coming
Not sure why this place only has 3 stars,every time we come here the food is really good and the service is good as well.  In the last 2 months we've been here 6 times and each time we always invite more friends to introduce them to this place.

Haven't had a bad experience so I recommend to give this place a shot and try out their pizzas and burgers.

I don't leave too many reviews even though I should leave more but when I saw this place only had 3 stars, I had to write a review because I feel it was unjust.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">came in tonight and waited 10 minutes to be seated (not bad once we were noticed we were seated). We were seated and about 5 minutes later another table was seated next to us. 5 minutes after they were seated a waitress comes and takes their drink orders. Still waiting...we waited about 20 minutes until I decided to go find a booster for my 4 year old. Finally we get a waitress (who was really nice) who took our drink order. we ordered pizza after being there for 45 min. Our pizza came and we were notified it was the wrong one (our pizza was given to another table) so we were given the wrong pizza and we're notified we would receive the right pizza (that was nice). Main complaint...we sat while others were attended to that came in after us. Wrong pizza...and out total visit was 2 hours!!! once we received service it was good but waiting 45 minutes for any service is ridiculous!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As soon as I walked through the door, there was already a customer asking for the manager. I figured maybe they had a tiny issue that was unrelated to our first visit. I don't like judging places right off the back so I decided I would ignore that customer. We asked for a table for five and got pointed to our table. The person who was assisting us was unwelcoming and rude off the back. We were asking questions about the beers and we had asked about one they were apparently out of. Instead of saying something along the lines of "we're currently out of that one but here are some similar options" we got a straight out "we're out of that one. What beers do you guys want??" I have worked in restaurants and customer service related jobs, and even when I was having the most lousy day I wouldn't allow it to get in the way of helping out my customers. The service was just overall unprofessional and I left not wanting to experience this place for the first time, or ever. If you're expecting a tip at the end, Here's a tip honey, don't be such a lousy person. It's your job to serve people, suck it up buttercup.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to this location several times. My experiences at Oggi's have been great. The employees are very polite and extremely nice.  Excellent food and most of all, great prices.  The customer service is excellent.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came to this place to celebrate that I had bought my wedding dress and so I went with my bridal party their pizza selection was a bit confusing but nothing we couldn't manage I ordered a fish bowl and asked to water it down with more soda and she never did so I cancelled my drink. But their pizza and other sides were soooo delish and I definitely can't wait to go back here again<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">38 TVs throughout the restaurant!! Need to use the restroom during the game? Not a problem! You'll most likely miss a few seconds as you walk to the bathroom because every section of the restaurant has TVs facing in various positions so you can watch as you walk to the bathroom. Made it to the bathroom? No need to hurry, there's a TV in there too!! Just don't forget to wash your hands!

As for the food, I highly recommend checking in on yelp and getting the free cheese crust sticks (Oggis sticks). Don't let your eyes eat more than your stomach because you can easily share one order between 3 people. They're super cheesy crust was on point.

Service was great, too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here twice so far and had James twice! He was super busy but still managed to take care of us. Had some good drinks and great pizza. I got the BBQ pizza (World Series? I'm not sure the menu name) and loved it. So great the crust is amazing. James always seems to have a great attitude even when slammed. 
Definitely go here, highly recommended<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've never been to this location until last night. The place seemed pretty dead which was no surprise because of the location. I ordered food Togo, one medium pizza and an order of boneless wings. The food was good but definitely not worth $32. The wings were $10.99 and we only got 7 pieces of chicken that barely had any sauce/flavor. A 14" pizza with two topping for $20, also not worth it. I only came to this location for its convenience but that was probably the last time. Food quality is simply not worth the high price.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decent food, great customer service, fun atmosphere, but they raised the prices. Used to $5.95 for mugs, and now it's $8. Going to Big's or Brian's next time... Bummer.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome place... That's all I'm going to say. Love the atmosphere and the food. They even play the Angels game in the restroom . My only complaint would be the service. The waitress was not very warm and the manager didn't seem to be either.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Happy Hour deal was alright.  Boneless wings for $6, draft beer $4.  Food is ok, nothing special.  Service was friendly, but really slow.  My party constantly had issues looking for her when we needed things.  Overall, this wouldn't be a place where I'd be itching to come back.

Check in on yelp and get a free order of cheese bread!  It's surprisingly a large portion.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Plenty of big screens for Sunday football. Plenty of parking.  Good food and a decent happy hour.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here after school (CSUF) one day and ordered pizza, wings, and salad....The pizza needs more sauce, I ordered some on the side. My salad was wilted, I ate the few good greens but they shouldn't serve old mixed greens. And my boneless wings were dry & also needed more sauce, some wings were half covered with sauce. Sauce shortage? Even the carrots sticks that came with the wings were old, not fresh nor crispy :(  Beer was fine, that's the only thing that didn't disappoint, oh and the bread sticks that came with the salad were good. I would come back ONLY for drinks...no food<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We decided to check out Oggi's this evening. I was really surprised at how empty the place was.  Made me think maybe it wasn't good, boy was I wrong.  We went with our 1 year old daughter and all the servers were super nice and helpful.  Our server, magi was so nice and attentive.

As far as food goes, I had the bruschetta flat great and it was delicious, I finished the whole thing.  My husband had the fish tacos and he said they were good as well.

Before we were leaving I checked-in and there was a cinnamon dessert offer.  We showed our girl and she immediately put the order in.  I was shocked to see a full size dessert come out!  BEST yelp check in offer I have ever received!

I highly recommend it here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered a Santa Fe chicken salad and it was dry. Tasted nasty and my friend got a fettuccine Alfredo and it had no taste. Don't recommend this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Unfortunately, the server/bartender by the name of Ben was so rude that we won't be back. On two separate occasions, first my boyfriend one night and second my boyfriends mom and me a completely different day. Oggi's will definitely lose business if they don't get rid of him due to his poor attitude, which is a shame because the food, atmosphere, and beer are all great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here a number of times over the years.  James and Kymm (bartenders) have always been incredibly fun, jovial, personable, hospitable, and, most especially, welcoming.  The kitchen is open late, the beer options are always top notch, and the staff is always nice.  Don't expect a "fancy date night out" but if you want great people, a great atmosphere, a great selection of beer, wine, well drinks, and fun-loving people, this is the place to go to.  Can't go wrong if you like great people good beer/food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wonderful bar staff, especially James and Jasmine. 

Wide variety of a menu, fairly priced, with happy hour menus.

Great place to come for a brew, a snack or to catch the game. A laid back atmosphere, with a great staff.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really disappointing service... Bartenders clearly can't handle serving bar area and the bar... We are leaving. Also need better AC, too hot in here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my third time eating food from Oggi's, and I haven't been disappointed at all each time.  Granted, I've only ordered the chicken Alfredo each time, but it's just so delicious and amazing! Our server, Jazmine, was also extremely nice and accomodating, and it made my friend's and my experience eating here even better. I'll definitely come back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my first time eating at Oggi's and it was a great experience (: the server is suuper nice! 5 stars (:<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Back for another round at Oggi's. Great food and better beer. Server was attentive and knowledgeable. Check this place out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service today!!! Samantha greeted us with a great big smile and seated us wherever we chose!!! She had our drinks and appetizers brought out in minutes of being seated. Thanks to Samantha we definitely will be back!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If I had to describe this place in two words it would be "remarkably unremarkable".

I came here with my friends after we got out of class at Cal State Fullerton and we figured since it's close to campus we'll give it a shot. We were seated fairly quickly and given our menus and we're able to get in one round of drinks in before happy hour ended. I ordered a pint of the Duck Dive hefeweizen and it was extremely bland, almost like drinking water. Hell, I tasted the lemon that I squeezed in more than the beer.

I also ordered the fish and chips which were (surprise!) bland. Though the batter was crispy it had little to no flavor, just like the fish. Also, the plate was brought out to me with no tartar sauce or cocktail sauce. After asking for tartar sauce, the fish was much better mostly because the tartar sauce had a nice flavor to it.

Service overall was good but not great, though we did have to ask several times for things. Other than that the meal was okay at best and I'm not so sure that I'll be returning here in the future.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.

Maybe it was my fault for coming during the first week they opened up.  But holy crap was it a bad experience.  

The place smelled like a construction site: odors of building materials, dust, paint, etc...
It was way to warm inside, and the heat lamp style lighting over the barstools doesnt help either.  
The service was atrocious.  We order a bbq chicken pizza without gouda from the inattentive bartender, and sure enough it comes with gouda.  He tries to pass the buck on the kitchen, when in reality he didnt ring it up correctly as the ticket doesnt show the modification.  
The manager tries to resolve the situation and gets us another, and this one does come out without the gouda, but it's missing the other ingredients listed on the description... no onions or cilantro.  SMH Oggi's, its just a simple pizza. 

We also ordered some wings, meh.  Overcooked & chewy.  

But at least they have their beer, and the beer is priced decently.  So yeah, 2 stars for that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great pizza! Good beer! A little over priced but it's a nice place to go to relax and have pizza and beer. The staff are nice and friendly. Haven't had a bad experience yet.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went with a group (10 with reservations) got seated right away and drink orders taken. At the time, it was quite busy but I must say the service and food was great. The pizza is awesome, had 3 different ones, and the chicken wings were great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went on Sunday to watch the games. Wasn't too busy so I figured service would be decent. Although we waited long periods for or orders and didn't receive some of the items we ordered the food was still great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love coming to Oggis food is on point and service is always great. Staff is friendly and the restrooms are always clean. Can't go wrong with that! They also Have good happy hour.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Disappointing! Not worth it. I rather have $5 Little Cesar's pizza that taste like cardboard then eat this...I wish it had been better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Unpleasantly Surprised. 
I have been an Oggis customer since the Del Mar Stuft Pizza days. So when I heard one was opening in Fullerton, I was so excited. I ordered an Oggi's Special, and it was anything but. The crust did not rise around the pizza. It was very bland, almost like it had no yeast, or was not allowed to sit. I give it two stars because my daughter liked her lettuce wraps, but I may not want to order the pizza again. :-/<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have eaten here a few times. The sliders are amazing! The pasta dishes are huge! The wait times are a little long, so that's why it's a 4 star and not a 5.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I will not be coming back here the crust of the pizza is so bad none of us at it. We also ordered garlic knots came with 8 huge piece and one tiny little ranch for all of that and it was dry af!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My delivery order took over an hour and my burger was soggy with wilted lettuce. The fry's were really mushy and cold. Should have went to 5 Guy's!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sat with my 2 boys and was given menus.   8 minutes go by with no service and the booth next to us sits down after us by 5 min and gets their order.   Bummer and we left.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">In the town I grew up there was an Oggis and it was seriously amazing. Their food, their service, everything. When I found out that we were getting an Oggis down here I was beyond excited! I started telling all my friends, letting them know how good they were and how they HAD to try them. Well now I look like a jackass because this Oggis is horrible. 
The first time we went was with some friends that came from out of town about 3 months after they opened. My friend ended up getting the chicken parmesan that looked like something out of a banquet dinner box. Our pizza was ok but nothing to write home about. Her chicken parm was cold and tasted like it was just microwaved. Needless to say we left embarrassed that we suggested that place. 
Tonight I was scrolling through groupon and saw that they had one going and thought that this was a good time to give them another try. My husband and I both ordered the build your own burger. I ordered mine with grilled onions and when it came out it had mushrooms on it. It's fine, everyone makes mistakes. 10 minutes later I get the new burger back and it is so greasy that I couldn't even eat it. Their coleslaw was brown and tasted like it was made days ago and was just sitting out drying up waiting for someone to order it. When it came time to pay we told our server we had a groupon and she said can I see your phone so I can get the code? Sure. She takes my phone and leaves with it. All of my information is on my phone. My bank accounts, personal emails, social media everything and she took off with the phone. She was gone for at least 3 minutes no where to be found with my phone in hand wherever she was. When she came back to our table she gave us the check and left. I had almost all of my food left and she didn't even offer a box. As we were leaving I asked another associate to speak with the manager. OF COURSE  just my luck, who is the manager on duty? Our waitress. This is where she plays so nice after being rude and condiscending to us all night. I told her I need to speak with someone else about our experience tonight. Then all the "What happened?" "What's wrong?" "Was it the food?" questions started. She said they just changed owners a week ago and didn't have her number but took a business card with the previous owners name and scribbled her name on it. 
This will definitely be the last time I EVER set foot in that restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Party of 13 and Jen our server was awesome. Food and atmosphere was great. This was a great choice to celebrate a special birthday. I highly recommend it. Thanks again Jen for the great service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Where should I start? Oggis has amazing food! I love their hot wings and flatbreads. The club flatbread is my favorite. The service is great as well. Jasmine the manager is friendly and so sweet! Magi and Christina and Jennifer are my favorite servers! Ps they also Have fish bowls!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service,  great food and definitely one of my favorite Sports Bars.  Jazmine the manager went out of her way to get the game on for us and was a great server on top of that.  Definitely recommend this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They meet my major threefold test for a restaurant: convenient, good food, and reasonable prices.  Very good thin crust pizza, and a good selection of beer, including an assortment of beers brewed in-house.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've never experienced anything worse than my visit today.  Since I live in the UH apartments above Oggis, we get a VIP card that gives us 20% off the entire check.

Oggi's does a lunch special from 11am-4pm. I ordered the Chicken tequila for 9.99 and the soup for an additional 1.99. Before ordering from the lunch special menu, I asked my server if I was allowed to use my VIP card with the lunch special. He said yes and he even asked someone in the back to make sure It was okay. I also ordered a drink that was 2.49. So I expected a check around 14.50 before tax and any discounts. 

When I got my check, the bill was around 19.00$.  This is even after my 20% discount. They charged me 11.99 for the chicken tequila, 4.99 for the soup and 2.49 for the drink(the drink was ok).  I asked my server about it and he said he'd fix it.

After getting my check for the second time, I was charged 9.99 for the chicken tequila and still 4.99 for the soup.  After being fed up with the situation, I just went to the manager. And what do you know, apparently you can't use the VIP card with the lunch special. My server even "confirmed" with someone in the back that it was okay. 

So I ended up paying 16.00 for something that should have been around 12.00(with the discount).  I just paid the bill anyway because I was just over the situation and the manager wouldn't do anything about it. 

I'm just really upset that my server "confirmed" that it would be okay to use my VIP card, when it was not okay.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Maybe I should have just gone with my gut and got a pizza. Ordered the chicken parmesan, first off it came out with no knife. Over cooked and dry, the chicken was impossible to cut with my fork. Server was no where to be found after she dropped our food and ran so I just attempted to eat this with a butter knife. Possibly the worst sauce I have eaten. Had zero flavor, definitely missing salt. I would preferred they had used a can of store bought pasta sauce for a dollar because it would have had more flavor.

Two massive breaded and fried chicken breast pieces pounded down and severed on top of pasta that unfortunately was served with the same tasteless sauce. Food was inedible. My server returned and I ordered fries and chicken wings (both were hot and well seasoned.) and pushed my plate to the side.

To the servers credit after dropping the bill and my refusal of the to-go box for the full plate sitting on the table, she asked if everything was okay and I couldn't help but tell her how horrible the sauce covering the entire plate was. She did remove the plate from my bill, which was nice and unexpected. 

Having had a roommate that used to work here and would bring home some pretty decent pizza, that is the only reason I don't rate this place one star.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just left , pizza is good service sucks. The bartender has an attitude, I stood at the hostess table for 5minutes and nobody in the restaurant approached me. I was at the table and the bar tender had an attitude. I had to chase a cook for a glass of water 30 min of waiting for her. Jasmine is a very nice and professional GM just wish her team had her pleasant attitude. They offered me a $10 gift card to come back I left it at their table. I will not come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had never tried Oggi's before, but knew it was a chain, so I knew not to get my expectations up tooooo high.

Got the free oggi sticks with a check-in, which were bland, but came in a pretty generous serving size. I also ordered the custom burger with sautéed mushrooms, garlic aioli, and a fried egg. The burger itself was good, but it was lacking that extra kick of flavor that would have made it AMAZING. 

This place is really close to where my boyfriend lives, so its very convenient to grab a bite late at night when we get hungry. I probably would venture back if I had late night cravings, but I'd try something new.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">San Diego is the original location for these guys and where I am from. I thought it would be awesome to stop in and get my favorite eats and grog on, the Double Up IPA and a great pizza.

First off, let me mention that the original locals in San Diego do not compare to Chicago and New York, they are very good, but not that level. They do have some of the best pizza in San Diego, not the best but definitely up there. 

Why do I mention the San Diego locations (I have been to 4 of them), this Fullerton location is not as good as the others I have been to. It is good, but honestly, I think its the crust. There is no salt or flavor in the crust and crust is a big part of the picture. Toppings are good, Beer is Very Good - I love the Double Up IPA, but the Pizza at this location is not as good as the others I have been to. I wish I could give these guys higher stars, but it simply is not up to the standards of their other locations. But the beer is still very good :)

Service was OK - I could see why others complained. I simply feel they are under staffed. The place was full at 6pm - they have a very good Happy Hour that ends at 7pm Monday through Friday, 9:30 am on Sunday to 4pm (not sure if I have the 4pm right) during the football season.

Parking is another concern and it seems like it is hit or miss. The arm was up (to get out) when I came in and still up when I left, but I validated my parking ticked just in case. Not sure what the story is with that, but the bartender was more than happy to validate (sorry, I am not sure how long and/or how much that validation covers). The bartender even acknowledged that it was pricey and that she should validate my ticket "just in case" - which I thought was good service.

So in short, Very Good Beer, Very Good Happy Hour Menu - pizza needs a bit of work and a little slow on service, but I have hope as the San Diego locations are really good. I have been to this location over the past year a couple times and they are improving. I hope they continue to read the reviews and continue to improve.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service, delicious food and amazingly tasty beers!  You have to try the Black Magic stout - it's awesome!  Take a to-go jug - you won't be disappointed!  Cheers!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Overall it's a good place to study and have some food. I wish they had more vegetarian and vegan options though, they don't even have a veggie burger...? Kind of weird in this day and age. The Portobello quinoa veggie plate was good but it's not very lunch friendly, more of a dinner. If they would add on more vegetarian friendly options I would be a regular. Since they haven't, i've only been there once as a result. Get with the times guys!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here a few times, more often during happy hour and every time, service has been great and the food has been delicious. Granted it's not the healthiest fare but they do offer healthy options, just not in their happy hour menu which is to be expected! Nonetheless the oggis sticks are very filling. The boneless chicken chicken wings and chicken wings in general are pretty good too. As some reviewers have stated, you can easily over order as the portions are pretty big so make sure you share. Checkins also offer free order of oggis sticks which is a great value!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thumbs down. They didn't honor my expired groupon. I told the girl who waited on us in the beginning that we had an expired groupon we wanted to use since we were in the area, she didn't say anything about it being a problem or I would have walked right out until they figured everything out. Once the check came I said again I had the expired groupon i wanted to use, they then gave me a run around of my needing to call groupon myself and meanwhile expected me to pay the full check then and there. I know that's not the process, I even read from the groupon that they are supposed to honor the paid value, but there was nothing more I could do because she did 'talk to the manager'. I simply called groupon to report this businesses refusal to honor their agreement. groupon confirmed this business was in the wrong and refunded me. The food wasn't good enough for us to return anyways, but this experience solidified the need to never go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Maybe I'm just incredibly lucky, but I have been to this location about 5 times and never once had the kind of service as described by others in the reviews. The service has always been courteous and accommodating, even when its been crowded. I like that at least one of the TVs are showing soccer when a match is on. 

I've tried a wide variety of their items. Numerous appetizers, burgers, salads, sandwiches and pasta. Everything I've ordered was tasty and good quality, maybe not the best I've ever had, but I've never been unhappy with anything I've ordered. I would come here before buffalo wild wings or any other chain sports bar. 

Favorite items so far are the chicken tortilla soup, boneless wings, pot stickers, and burgers.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the lunch specials, every day.  Staff is friendly and competent.

They can't seem to get my pizza black on the bottom after five or six visits.  Next time I'll have the waitress repeat my instructions, and I'll tell her to send it back if they don't get it right.

They've been having a problem with the dish washing lately; last two visits there was not a clean plate or fork on the table.

Don't go during a major sporting event; it is so loud I'd wager the staff should be legally required to wear hearing protection!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lemmie tell you bout Oggi's. As a regretful resident of University House, I have gotten used to coming to Oggi's. It honestly may be the saving grace of my living situation. The food here is definitely a mix of bar food, with their specialty being pizza. I find that the pizza here is a bit soggy for my taste, but the toppings are always fresh, which is a plus. I will say, however, that the garlic knots are FANTASTIC. 4.99 is a great deal for such a great appetizer. They are plump, soft, and have just enough butter and garlic. I have also had the grilled chicken quesadilla which has been hit or miss. They do have some great beers on tap, including their own Oggi's brews. 
I do have to take two stars off for service. It is generally slow. It seems that they staff the restaurant with only a few of the same servers and bartenders because that's who I see working every time I come in. They seem consistently understaffed and on multiple occasions I have had to wait more than 10 minutes for service. I will say though, Jasmine has got it together. I hope when I walk in that she's working. She knows how to take care of customers and is the reason I keep coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is 3-4 star; service is a 0-star.  Food is pretty good for a chain; one I don't mind returning to.  But the service is just plain awful.  

Today at lunch, there appeared to be three waitresses/servers; as they walked quickly on by, they did not acknowledge me.  Two minutes later, I finally get a "hello" and was seated.  When my group is all here, they set us up with beverages and take our order promptly (nice!).  The salads come out 5-10 minutes later (nice), but our mains come out 30 minutes after ordering.  C'mon!  This is lunch folks--we don't have all day!  They drop off our bill while we're eating, but then take forever to track down to get a box & for them to take our bill.  My colleagues give me the "I told you so" when I return late to work.  Good food, but I'm so done being treated like I've got all day with time to waste.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is our families new Friday night go to pizza place. Awesome wait staff and great pizza and salad. This place can get packed during the dinner rush hour so I usually try to go early.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really liked this place, but the last couple of times they just can't get my pizza order right. I asked for an Alfredo, chicken and garlic and I'm pretty sure they forgot the Alfredo sauce.. Last time they forgot the garlic. We also ordered a beef pizza and the beef was just thrown on like an afterthought. There pizza was also pretty dry- it hardly had any red sauce.   This is very different from our first experience. The pizza on our first visit was to die for good. I'm very disappointed. The buffalo wings are still good.  That's why they got a 3 star rating.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Every single time me and my roommates (we live above the restaurant) come here they take forever to serve us. It's so awkward and frustrating. No one even walks by to give a friendly, "we'll be right with you!" It's easy to simply acknowledge customers, and I can understand if you're busy, but everyone acts like they either hate their jobs, have some incompetence with walking briskly, or they are physically blind. 

One time we watched the assistant manager smoke a cigarette and chit chat with the manager outside while my food order was wrong! I sat there for 15 minutes, complaints to multiple bus boys, and making disgruntled eye contact with her outside before finally demanding my money back and leaving. 

The majority of the time you come will be spent with craned necks hoping someone throws you a bread crumb.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Standard Oggi's  - it's pretty decent.    With a lot of more interesting places in the area this place isn't my first choice unless I want to get a lunch special which is kinda tricky on there menu. They advertise a $5.99 special but it's kinda minimal options. They throw in the other lunch special for 1 or 2 dollars more. It's a gimmick obviously but it's clean, nice and friendly staff over all.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food!  We had the BBQ chicken pizza, 
Baja 500 chicken sandwich (jalapeño is hot!). Also, if you love chocolate and peanut butter, OMG, they have an amazing mini-dessert for only three or four dollars. Service always amazing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oggis pizza and brew house is good food and a good time! My table had the heavyweight pizza and the oggi sticks. The pizza was really good. Good amount of toppings, cheese and sauce. The oggi sticks is like a very good cheese pizza. The customer service was really good! The restaurant was very clean. Validates parking. Good all around<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time at this location and not sure if I will be rushing back to this location.  We gave this location a shot due to receiving a flyer for a deal so we decided to give the pizza deal a try. (Maybe I should stop being so happy about scoring deals since I might end up paying for it with slow service)

We stood around for a few minutes to be seated since no one was manning the front desk.  There were initially six of us and they seated us in a booth that didn't quite accommodate all of us so we asked to be moved. (we all know what happens when you ask to be moved from one table to another, new server or hopefully they can work it out between the staff instead of front of the customer which they did).

Ok, I need to go back to focusing on the food.  We had the wings (Teriyaki and Sweet Thai Chili), pretty tasty and pizza.  Pizza was good but I'll stick to their specialty pizzas.

I'm not sure how long this location has been open but they need to work out the front of the house kinks because they still seem confused.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is pretty disappointing.  Came here a few times and each time was as bad as the last.  The service is horrible and their food is mediocre. My dirt visit there, I got the pizza. It was decent; not worth waiting almost an hour for it though. This time I got something different: fish and chips. I would give them negative stars if I could. After waiting almost an hour again, the plate came with three soggy little pieces of crap. Would expect better from baking Costco fish sticks. Plus is was a whoppin 12 bucks. 
Their brew is aight, though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good pizza and solid menu with options from wings, burgers, salads, and pastas. Full bar and solid choices of beers. Great for ball games and they provide plenty of specials. Good customer service. Reasonably priced<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can't get  enough of the jumbo wings. It's the best, I ordered online and it was delivered to my apartment faster than I thought.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can never go wrong with Oggi's! Chicken Tequilla Pasta is always on point and same with the Oggi's Sticks with pesto sauce and pepperoni.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tiffany is the best bartender! Super sweet, attentive, and personable. Sam & Matthew are awesome too!

Oggi's Sticks are addicting with ooey, gooey cheese, and the Guacamole Bacon burger is so good! Come in for happy hour to get good food & drink specials.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for the Angels day-after-victory pizza deal and our waitress gave us the stink eye when she saw the coupon and said the pizza oven is broken.  I get it; that happens I guess.  She wasn't very pleasant though so we just left.  We'd been here a few other times and service and food was just mediocre.  We'll probably give it another try after the next Angel's win and hope the oven is fixed by then.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Updated menu. Friendly staff. Still a great place for pizza and other stuff. Oggis Stix are amazing. Every pizza I've tried has been fairly good. Everything tastes fresh. Not sure why the ratings of this place are so low. Maybe you prefer the same boring taste of a BJ's and enjoy eating a bunch of bready crust without sauce or maybe you have no taste at all? Not really sure.....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is just great. My husband and I visit here often, and have always had an overall good experience. The pizza is delicious of course- but the entire menu is worth checking out too. By the way- they use only certified organic tomatoes, which is a plus! Screw getting BJ's when you can come here! (Read that last statement again). The food and service are much better here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">InGreat place to  come in and have a beer. I decided to sit at the bar where there are 7 flat screen TVs playing different channels each. Came in around 8 pm pretty packed for summer when everyone is not attending college at the moment. The service has been great so far. Tiffany and Melissa was of great service and they were really friendly. I would come back again after my classes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay, restaurant. Yesterday I would've gave them three stars, but as I keep coming they just seem to disappoint me.

They have good calamari but as I keep coming the portions just get smaller and seems a bit stingy. I like coming here because they usually have the game on though. 

One of the manager's who's a woman needs to be FIRED. She said she couldn't take my boyfriend's I.D because of a chip on the corner. She had the nerve to tell US it is not accepted anywhere, yet my boyfriend just got off the plane from Colorado and uses his I.D everywhere! But we didn't make a big deal about it, I just said "ok, well it can't be a policy because he uses it everywhere." Then she tried to look at me like I was the stupid one and said it was a policy. Smh some people are just plain retarded. Ultimately I'm pretty sure she acted this way because my boyfriend is an African American male. Of course. Won't be coming here as often anymore.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered online via grubhub. Minimum is kinda high. Ordered the loaded fries, buffalo sliders, and double build your own burger. Order took about an hour to arrive, fries we're far from loaded, buffalo sliders were dried out, burger was missing a party & coleslaw was awful & dry. We called to have missing patty sent out. Manager was helpful and said it would be here in no more than 15 mins. 45 mins later we called to complain and that's when the driver arrived. We had requested another side of ranch & they forgot that. Told us they would refund the cost of the burger but they did not. 

Won't ever order online from them or go to the restaurant. Totally not worth the cost and the good was not good. Also when my parents went there a few weeks before his phone was stolen and they basically blamed him for leaving it on the table. 

You can get a similar menu at a much better value and taste elsewhere in Fullerton. Don't bother!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was great the first time I went but the service was absolutely unacceptable the second time! The only thing that comes to mind when I think of my experience today is extreme disappointment. 

I took my roommate here today for lunch and we were both extremely hungry. 1 to 2 servers, not very busy at 5pm. When we first arrived, I stood at the hostess counter for about 3-5 minutes waiting to be seated. The server who was waiting the area walked by at least two times and didn't say a word. Not even a "hello, we'll be with you in a minute" or "hello, welcome!" So rude. The hostess finally emerged from the kitchen to give 3 people waiting with their to-go food and seated us. We sat at the table staring at the menu for about 10-15 minutes. The waiter didn't come by or let us know he'd be with us. ridiculous! Worst service ever, we got up and left to go eat at the habit and what do you know they immediately greeted me and had my order ready in ten minutes.

Don't know if I will be returning to oggi's but may give their take-out a try since the food is quite tasty.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Using Grubhub, I ordered from Oggi's around 7pm last night VIA my cell. After being charged 75.00 I was told the order would take about 45 minutes... That was not the  case and the order took over 45 minutes past the 45 minute arrival time... 

However, here's what pisses me off... The food was cold, hot sandwich was soggy because it was steaming in those cheap plastic containers, and the fries tasted like they been sitting for a while... I called to complain however I was never given an reason, apology or credit for the inconvenience this caused... Grubhub and Oggi's, you both have lost my business!!!!!

Followup, the company wanted to give me 20.00 off my next visit... LOL Not worth it! As I stated, I will never shop from them again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Our favorite Oggi's was in Orange so when they closed the larger restaurant we decided to try the Fullerton one and it was just ok the food was good which is a plus but the service was extremely slow and it wasn't even busy. That was the only reason for the 3 stars other then that the California Gold Rules!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Dear management, please tell your incompetent kitchen workers to check the order before they bag it. Once again, I am left with salad without sauce. This is such fkn stupid. Last time going to this Oggi's.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to this location a few times now because it is quite literally down the street from me. It's unfortunate to say that although it's very convenient, it's usually a last resort. The food isn't bad but more often than not took a long time to get to the table. Twice I've gone in and they ran out of my favorite draft beers. 

The last time I went, and by far the worst experience, was during the World Cup. Myself and some friends went and after receiving my first beer no one came back to check on us for an hour! My friends needed to approach the staff to place an order instead. I found that to be very unprofessional. I understand it was busy, but an hour? Took me 4 hours to get out of there that day because no one would come by to give us the check. We could have walked out of there without paying and no one would have even noticed. Something really needs to change over there and fast or they aren't going to last much longer since Guppy House and Dillon's opened nearby.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hate to do this since I've recommended Oggi's to others for several years but here goes:

Oggi's opened a new location right next to CSUF, just a stone throws away from Mihaylo. Seemed like a great location with a lot of potential so I stopped by on back-to-back night during Finals.

Wed. May 14 (Night 1): The chicken sandwich & beer was good but the service was atrocious. The worst part was hearing every other table and bar patron complain about the wait & the staff's attitude. 

Thur. May 15 (Night 2): Arrived at 9:54pm to catch the 4th quarter of the Clippers game. Again, the bar was severely understaffed. A lot of complaints were observed & the bartenders were over-matched. I managed to sit at the bar until 10:08 without being acknowledged  or offered a drink. Even though I  was wearing a suit & tie on from my presentation, I couldn't get served. I can't imagine ever stopping by that Oggi location again. Poor management.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is amazing, TV's everywhere, great pizza, great beer selection. Friendly staff.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My Boyfriend and I came in the other night looking to grab some grub and a few drinks, it was our first time at an Oggi's. We were able to sit at the bar right away even though we saw tables available, the bar looked like the place to be especially since the Angeles game was on! The bartender, Kimberly, was so sweet! I asked for recommendations on what to order and she gave us great recommendations. I ordered the fish tacos fried and my boyfriend got the matador burger, both were delicious! But the best part by far were Kimberly's drinks. I first had a lemon drop which is my go to to test a drink makers abilities and it was f***ing perfect! Not too sweet like weak bartenders make and just the right balance. I don't remember the other drink that I ordered,also based on the bartenders recommendation, but I loved it! Some type of vodka and citrus drink in a tall glass. The boyfriend order margaritas on the rocks and I tried a sip and again, they were on point! We will definitely come back and try the flatbread pizza that were another recommendation. Thank you bartender for the great experience and hopefully the next time we are in you will be working the bar!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The order was placed online at 6:40 PM and it's currently 8:40 PM. Called first at 7:40 PM for order status and was told the order was on the road. Called the second time at 8:20 PM and was told the order HASNT LEFT YET with an estimated additional 45 minutes for delivery. I have heard the service here was pretty bad but I was not expecting this. It's unacceptable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food but we rarely saw our waitress! Wish we had seen the reviews before going there. Looks like bad service is par for the course with this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We love the Oggis in Orange so we were happy to give this one a try.  We were concerned about the parking because it is in a giant apartment complex and down the street from Cal State Fullerton.  However, there was plenty of free parking in the building.  Went during happy hour Friday night so the beers were only $3.95 -- and as good as always.  Food was good--but not quite as good as the one in Orange.  The salad just seemed thrown together with way too much dressing and the Oggi sticks just weren't quite right.  Pizza was good though.

Service wasn't very attentive.  I assume it will get better over time.  Price was very reasonable given there was six of us.  Overall, it was good and we will give it another shot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We ordered the garlic knots and cheese bread since my friend had a penchant for appetizer breads.

The garlic knots came out pretty bland and the cheese bread was mediocre at best. They were better at the Oggi's in Anaheim near Disneyland. 

My friend got the patty melt for his entree and I picked the boneless bbq wings.
The entrees just taste like any other typical brewery pizza spot- nothing special. 

There's a free small cheese bread when you check in on yelp tho!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is awesome, great food and extremely fast service. The waitress Jasmine was kind and sexy oh yeah very helpful too :3

I am definitely gonna recommend Oggies to my friends and coworkers.<p>

Oggi's Sticks are addicting with ooey, gooey cheese, and the Guacamole Bacon burger is so good! Come in for happy hour to get good food & drink specials.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for the Angels day-after-victory pizza deal and our waitress gave us the stink eye when she saw the coupon and said the pizza oven is broken.  I get it; that happens I guess.  She wasn't very pleasant though so we just left.  We'd been here a few other times and service and food was just mediocre.  We'll probably give it another try after the next Angel's win and hope the oven is fixed by then.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Updated menu. Friendly staff. Still a great place for pizza and other stuff. Oggis Stix are amazing. Every pizza I've tried has been fairly good. Everything tastes fresh. Not sure why the ratings of this place are so low. Maybe you prefer the same boring taste of a BJ's and enjoy eating a bunch of bready crust without sauce or maybe you have no taste at all? Not really sure.....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is just great. My husband and I visit here often, and have always had an overall good experience. The pizza is delicious of course- but the entire menu is worth checking out too. By the way- they use only certified organic tomatoes, which is a plus! Screw getting BJ's when you can come here! (Read that last statement again). The food and service are much better here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">InGreat place to  come in and have a beer. I decided to sit at the bar where there are 7 flat screen TVs playing different channels each. Came in around 8 pm pretty packed for summer when everyone is not attending college at the moment. The service has been great so far. Tiffany and Melissa was of great service and they were really friendly. I would come back again after my classes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay, restaurant. Yesterday I would've gave them three stars, but as I keep coming they just seem to disappoint me.

They have good calamari but as I keep coming the portions just get smaller and seems a bit stingy. I like coming here because they usually have the game on though. 

One of the manager's who's a woman needs to be FIRED. She said she couldn't take my boyfriend's I.D because of a chip on the corner. She had the nerve to tell US it is not accepted anywhere, yet my boyfriend just got off the plane from Colorado and uses his I.D everywhere! But we didn't make a big deal about it, I just said "ok, well it can't be a policy because he uses it everywhere." Then she tried to look at me like I was the stupid one and said it was a policy. Smh some people are just plain retarded. Ultimately I'm pretty sure she acted this way because my boyfriend is an African American male. Of course. Won't be coming here as often anymore.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered online via grubhub. Minimum is kinda high. Ordered the loaded fries, buffalo sliders, and double build your own burger. Order took about an hour to arrive, fries we're far from loaded, buffalo sliders were dried out, burger was missing a party & coleslaw was awful & dry. We called to have missing patty sent out. Manager was helpful and said it would be here in no more than 15 mins. 45 mins later we called to complain and that's when the driver arrived. We had requested another side of ranch & they forgot that. Told us they would refund the cost of the burger but they did not. 

Won't ever order online from them or go to the restaurant. Totally not worth the cost and the good was not good. Also when my parents went there a few weeks before his phone was stolen and they basically blamed him for leaving it on the table. 

You can get a similar menu at a much better value and taste elsewhere in Fullerton. Don't bother!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was great the first time I went but the service was absolutely unacceptable the second time! The only thing that comes to mind when I think of my experience today is extreme disappointment. 

I took my roommate here today for lunch and we were both extremely hungry. 1 to 2 servers, not very busy at 5pm. When we first arrived, I stood at the hostess counter for about 3-5 minutes waiting to be seated. The server who was waiting the area walked by at least two times and didn't say a word. Not even a "hello, we'll be with you in a minute" or "hello, welcome!" So rude. The hostess finally emerged from the kitchen to give 3 people waiting with their to-go food and seated us. We sat at the table staring at the menu for about 10-15 minutes. The waiter didn't come by or let us know he'd be with us. ridiculous! Worst service ever, we got up and left to go eat at the habit and what do you know they immediately greeted me and had my order ready in ten minutes.

Don't know if I will be returning to oggi's but may give their take-out a try since the food is quite tasty.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Using Grubhub, I ordered from Oggi's around 7pm last night VIA my cell. After being charged 75.00 I was told the order would take about 45 minutes... That was not the  case and the order took over 45 minutes past the 45 minute arrival time... 

However, here's what pisses me off... The food was cold, hot sandwich was soggy because it was steaming in those cheap plastic containers, and the fries tasted like they been sitting for a while... I called to complain however I was never given an reason, apology or credit for the inconvenience this caused... Grubhub and Oggi's, you both have lost my business!!!!!

Followup, the company wanted to give me 20.00 off my next visit... LOL Not worth it! As I stated, I will never shop from them again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Our favorite Oggi's was in Orange so when they closed the larger restaurant we decided to try the Fullerton one and it was just ok the food was good which is a plus but the service was extremely slow and it wasn't even busy. That was the only reason for the 3 stars other then that the California Gold Rules!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Dear management, please tell your incompetent kitchen workers to check the order before they bag it. Once again, I am left with salad without sauce. This is such fkn stupid. Last time going to this Oggi's.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to this location a few times now because it is quite literally down the street from me. It's unfortunate to say that although it's very convenient, it's usually a last resort. The food isn't bad but more often than not took a long time to get to the table. Twice I've gone in and they ran out of my favorite draft beers. 

The last time I went, and by far the worst experience, was during the World Cup. Myself and some friends went and after receiving my first beer no one came back to check on us for an hour! My friends needed to approach the staff to place an order instead. I found that to be very unprofessional. I understand it was busy, but an hour? Took me 4 hours to get out of there that day because no one would come by to give us the check. We could have walked out of there without paying and no one would have even noticed. Something really needs to change over there and fast or they aren't going to last much longer since Guppy House and Dillon's opened nearby.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hate to do this since I've recommended Oggi's to others for several years but here goes:

Oggi's opened a new location right next to CSUF, just a stone throws away from Mihaylo. Seemed like a great location with a lot of potential so I stopped by on back-to-back night during Finals.

Wed. May 14 (Night 1): The chicken sandwich & beer was good but the service was atrocious. The worst part was hearing every other table and bar patron complain about the wait & the staff's attitude. 

Thur. May 15 (Night 2): Arrived at 9:54pm to catch the 4th quarter of the Clippers game. Again, the bar was severely understaffed. A lot of complaints were observed & the bartenders were over-matched. I managed to sit at the bar until 10:08 without being acknowledged  or offered a drink. Even though I  was wearing a suit & tie on from my presentation, I couldn't get served. I can't imagine ever stopping by that Oggi location again. Poor management.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is amazing, TV's everywhere, great pizza, great beer selection. Friendly staff.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My Boyfriend and I came in the other night looking to grab some grub and a few drinks, it was our first time at an Oggi's. We were able to sit at the bar right away even though we saw tables available, the bar looked like the place to be especially since the Angeles game was on! The bartender, Kimberly, was so sweet! I asked for recommendations on what to order and she gave us great recommendations. I ordered the fish tacos fried and my boyfriend got the matador burger, both were delicious! But the best part by far were Kimberly's drinks. I first had a lemon drop which is my go to to test a drink makers abilities and it was f***ing perfect! Not too sweet like weak bartenders make and just the right balance. I don't remember the other drink that I ordered,also based on the bartenders recommendation, but I loved it! Some type of vodka and citrus drink in a tall glass. The boyfriend order margaritas on the rocks and I tried a sip and again, they were on point! We will definitely come back and try the flatbread pizza that were another recommendation. Thank you bartender for the great experience and hopefully the next time we are in you will be working the bar!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The order was placed online at 6:40 PM and it's currently 8:40 PM. Called first at 7:40 PM for order status and was told the order was on the road. Called the second time at 8:20 PM and was told the order HASNT LEFT YET with an estimated additional 45 minutes for delivery. I have heard the service here was pretty bad but I was not expecting this. It's unacceptable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food but we rarely saw our waitress! Wish we had seen the reviews before going there. Looks like bad service is par for the course with this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We love the Oggis in Orange so we were happy to give this one a try.  We were concerned about the parking because it is in a giant apartment complex and down the street from Cal State Fullerton.  However, there was plenty of free parking in the building.  Went during happy hour Friday night so the beers were only $3.95 -- and as good as always.  Food was good--but not quite as good as the one in Orange.  The salad just seemed thrown together with way too much dressing and the Oggi sticks just weren't quite right.  Pizza was good though.

Service wasn't very attentive.  I assume it will get better over time.  Price was very reasonable given there was six of us.  Overall, it was good and we will give it another shot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We ordered the garlic knots and cheese bread since my friend had a penchant for appetizer breads.

The garlic knots came out pretty bland and the cheese bread was mediocre at best. They were better at the Oggi's in Anaheim near Disneyland. 

My friend got the patty melt for his entree and I picked the boneless bbq wings.
The entrees just taste like any other typical brewery pizza spot- nothing special. 

There's a free small cheese bread when you check in on yelp tho!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is awesome, great food and extremely fast service. The waitress Jasmine was kind and sexy oh yeah very helpful too :3

I am definitely gonna recommend Oggies to my friends and coworkers.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oggi's is a great spot for a quick lunch after your classes at CSUF. I came here with a friend to redeem my e-foodie coupon for a free entree with a purchase of another. We started off with Honey BBQ Wings, Loaded Fries, and Oggi's Traditional Cheese Sticks as our appetizers (Man were we hungry...) As for our entrees, we tried the Italian Stack sandwiches and Oggi's Special Pizza (The Works). The food came out quickly and servers were friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back again for lunch with my friends!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A solid 3-star experience last night. 

I was nervous with many negative reviews, but in the end it was the food that was mediocre, not the service. 

We were there fairly late (9pm) on Sunday night. We were greeted promptly at the desk and our waiter was quite prompt with menus and taking our drink order.  It was very quiet with maybe a total of 5-6 tables occupied and just the one server. 

If you're reading this, you must take advantage of the check-in offer for the bread- it was quite good an enough for our party of 4 to share. 

We ordered pasta, pot roast, pizza, and prosciutto mac & cheese.  The pasta was very average and so was the pot roast. The Mac & cheese smelled like dirt and we sent it back for a burger.  The burger was actually the best thing we had. It was very good.  Pizza was fine. 

This place clearly exists for the sports and college students. Prices were reasonable. 

It was worth a try, but no real reason to return unless we want to catch a game.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Has a pretty good selection on beer on tap. Food was good although it took a long time for it to come out. Love the amount of tv's! Happy hour is well priced.

Service on the other hand was pretty Damn bad. Had to ask for silverware and napkins twice and when my friend arrived took forever to get someone's attention to get him a beer and food. Then the bartenders serving us were sitting in a back corner eating and talking while they had people who clearly need service( including our table)! They seemed friendly enough but just didn't look like they wanted to be at work. They could not handle 7 tables and maybe 4 bar tabs and there were 2 of them. Highly disappointed in service food was enough to give them 2 stars. 

Will give them one more chance since its still new. But pick it up!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I came here for the first time and I really liked it overall! I loved the boneless BBQ wings! Huge chunks of chicken breast with a good amount of breading and lots of sauce :) I also ordered the pizza but it was too doughy for me, even tho the toppings and sauce were delicious. I tried the fries and they were awesome, and the hang 10 burger was very good as well. Overall it was a good experience, and the service was good even though he did forget certain things and food took more than I thought it would.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i live in anaheim i useto go to the one in garden grove but now fullerton is so worth the drive!! MORE TVS AND MUCH MORE MODERN AND LOTS OF LIGHT. Plus garden grove dont sale any alcohol anymore because they are going through new ownership.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered off GrubHub for a delivery. We ordered 2 of the Texas BBQ burger along with onion rings as an appetizer. The order ended up coming fifteen minutes late, and perhaps because the delivery took too long, the burgers ended up a little soggy. Otherwise, they tasted pretty good. I love the crispy beer batter onion rings. It's as pricey as any other sit in sports bar, except they have free delivery with a minimum $25 order. I've been to a different Oggi's, and its definitely better fresh sitting in a table rather than having it sent to your house.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">In town for business and came across this place on yelp. I mainly came for the beer, which was good (at least the IPA was). The salad I ordered was nothing special. The burger and fries were okay. Mediocre at best. The server was nice, but it took quite a while to get my food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a really great place to chill and eat! It has a great atmosphere and is so much fun. Their pizzas here are really great, and not that expensive! Their specials are so awesome, it definitely worth it. I love this place, and would come again if I'm in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It is okay. The place is very hit or miss, both with service be food quality. I've come and had really good experiences. My second time here I had to leave because no one took my order after 15 minutes.  I came for several World Cup games...they didn't bring in enough bar staff so the bartender was somewhat overworked. Still, even when it emptied it took her over 10 minutes to take my order, forgot my salad, and well over 10 minutes to take my money for my bill. In that time she forgot other orders, others had to wait over 10 minutes for their bill. Friendliness of staff varies quite a bit too. Seems like they have figured out the food, but a little more training for some of the staff and consistency in customer experience would go a long way. 

I'm not a vegetarian but a couple more options would be good as well!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was good but our service was bad. If you don't want to be a server then find a new line of work. Your service will be reflected in your tip.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would give zero stars if I could. I placed an order for delivery at 7:11pm tonight. It's currently 9:32 pm and still no food. They close at 9pm. I called around 8:30 to check the status after an hour an half wait (they are 11min from my house), I was told it was out the door on the way to me. 45 minutes later I call to check what happened. I was told they would check on the driver. At this point I ordered pizza from another company. Worst experience ever. First time trying them, I couldn't even tell you if the food is good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Specials are amazing and the lunch deal is out of this world.

The service is amazing I mean if you get a chance to be served by zack hes awesome tip him $20 cause this will be the best service ever. 

The cob salad is to die for and the pizza is soo yummy. 

The staff is just so friendly in general. 

This place blows Bj's out the water. oh make sure to try their IPA.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just walked out this evening without being served.

Only seven tables were occupied when we arrived. Tons of staff. Got seated and nobody even looked our way for 20 minutes.

A few servers and hosts passed our table without a look or any interest in helping.

Complained to the manager and left. Plenty of other pizza and wings places, and table service to boot! 

Won't be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had the Fettuccine Alfredo pasta with chicken, I was very satisfied the quantity was perfect. The pizza is nicely crisped and very good. Will definitely be coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Free breadsticks from e-foodie.
It was okay. ^^ not going to complain too much on free food<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Garlic Knotts and lightning pizza, or triathlon pizza. 
I know what I want before I'm even asked by a waiter. Oggi's offers a a signature style with their pizzas. Nothing beats an Oggi's Pizza! They also have a beer reputation and it's a great environment for sports fans.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pizzas was just so-so and WAY over priced for what you get. Service, decent. Atmosphere, whatever.
Definitly not going back. Pieology is better....Costco's pizza is better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So, beer & pizza with my boys & hubby, ordered Dijon salmon, Lasagna, large meat lover pizza, Oggie's beer, all were yummy, love the food, the beer, our bartender was very attentive and helpful with the beer selection! Good jobs guys!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everytime I've come here service and food has been great. The prices are inexpensive and the servers are attentive. Plus the bar is awesome for watching any game you'd like! Lunch specials are great deals and last all the way until 4pm. Happy Hour from 4-7pm with $4 draft beer (any kind you want). Oggi's is awesome! :D<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food and drinks excellent as always but the service from Maggie was outstanding. We have been here several time and never received this wonderful attention. Thanks Maggie for the great service<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worth trying it out if you live in the area.  Got bunch of appetizers and beers. Cheeseticks  were ok. Garlic knotts are full of dough almost tasted raw. Never getting that again. Also ordered bbq wings which were surprisingly amazing. All and all ok. Service was a bit slow but not slow enough to complain. Try it out if you live locally.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Maybe they need to hire some extra waiters/waitresses.  The service was extremely slow.  I ordered a lunch special and added a Caesar salad and it took a long time before the salad came.  The Mediterranean wheat pasta was a big sour. I think I am going to stick with their pizza because the pizzas are delicious.  The Caesar salad was not tossed, they just placed a cup of the Caesar salad dressing on the side of the plate.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The service was great! The happy hour deals were good, the beer was great. I really liked it! I highly recommend to go watch a game, get a beer, or just get good pizza. I liked all the options.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered a pizza, 45 minutes went by and it never came out, told the guy we've been waiting for it and he said "oh alright I'll go get it" and he just grabs us the check with just our drinks on it. So just left unsatisfied and hungry<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good corner location, but not my favorite.  Tried the Flatbread pizza but didn't care for it.  Husband likes the quality of cheese on their pizzas.  Good for group gatherings....lots of big tables.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can wave a cab in NYC quicker than getting service at Oggis! I've been here several times and this was the first where my family and I got ignored! The bus boy had to keep telling our waiter we needed help! Still got ignored! So Bryce if you wonder why you didn't get a tip, this is why! Don't get the bus boy to do your job!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I came here to watch the game 3 of Western conf. for the Kings hockey game and game 3 of NBA Eastern conf. finals.  Initial reaction....they have more tv's than seats.  Place was sorta empty for a Saturday night playoff Memorial day weekend.  I sat at the bar and ordered the honey bbq wings...bleh.nuff said..  Kinda small and dark for a sports bar. Ambience seems more family style rather than college sports bar.The Kings scored and I was the only one who cheered. Imagine my asian ass in an all white bar and I'M the only one who cheered...for hockey. lol.  Yelp offers free cheese sticks if you check in...dats cool.  They have some good beer..not a big selection though.  I ordered the California Gold. ..and dang...it went down smooth...it was good.  Overall...very average.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you are thinking of going to Oggi's.....stop.  These restaurants have always been hit and miss on their food qualtity but lately they are just a miss.  Too bad, the first Oggi's I went to was about a dozen years ago in Encinitas and the place was great.  The locations in Tustin and Fullerton, not so much.   I stopped in with my family for lunch at the Fullerton location and seating was almost completely open.  We quickly ordered and 35 minutes later we still hadn't received our food - with the exception of one salad that appeared to made from week old lettuce, it was disgusting.  The staff is nice enough but when I told them that we needed to cancel our order because we had to leave, they first agreed and then 10 minutes later showed up with a couple bags of boxed food.  Sensing my frustration, my wife told me to get the kids in the car.  She comes out to the car with the food and the first thing I notice is that I couldn't smell anything.  We opened the top boxes and everything was cold. Considering we were now at least 45 minutes from the time we ordered, the food had sitting out for quite sometime and just never brought to us.  Too make matters more odd, the table next to us sent back some food because it wasn't what they ordered and that food was also included in what was boxed up for us.  As a consolation, we were given a 20% discount which was something they were offering to everyone because the pizza ovens were down.  Which completely rubbed me the wrong way.   In the end, we spent $50 on a food order that was canceled and it wasn't even edible.  We are done with Oggi's.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So me and my friends went to Oggi's recently and had a great experience! We were served by the sweetest server named Cosmo who did a wonderful job serving us. We all split pizza and beer which was a great choice that you really can't go wrong with. I also have had there cinnamon twists with ice cream that are HEAVEN!! The brownie and ice cream is also very delicious. Oggi's gets a 5 star for food, service, as well as the vibe for enjoying any big game together with all their big screen T.V.s. Definitely going back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My family has frequented the Oggi's in Orange for years now. We have been excited for the Fullerton location to open because it is just down the street from us.  We've been to the Fullerton location 3 times now and have had very good experiences every time.
The staff is helpful and friendly.  As one of the other Yelpers stated Noelle is a great server.  She goes out of her way to help and is super friendly.  Our 5 year old daughter loves her because she always takes the time to talk to her.  
Oh yeah, they have great food and beer too. 
:-)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We just went once to order wings and pizza to go. The food quality was poor, but maybe it's the place to enjoy the beer and have fun watching sports with friends so it doesn't matter. I like TGIFs better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food and convenient location.  My server Taylor was very attentive and knew the menu well. I will definitely come back for Football Sundays.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It is really close to where I live so I usually end up there most weekends. Delicious pizza and friendly employees<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Had a spectacular meal with my family at Oggi's for my mom's birthday! We didn't realize we were supposed to get seated by someone so we just sat ourselves, and so they had no idea we were even there! But Jasmine came out and apologized regardless, even though she didn't have to! She was very sweet and gave great advice for what foods we should get, then she also gave us a complimentary hummus platter to make up for the inconvenience of waiting at the beginning (even though it was no ones fault and not a big deal to us), she then proceeded to check up on us frequently and make sure everything was perfect! After we had a wonderful meal, they brought us out a caramel ice cream sundae and a slice of cake on the house because they wanted to make my mom's birthday dinner memorable! The service was outstanding and nothing short of amazing! She then gave us a warm goodbye and a hug as we were leaving! Jasmine is a great waitress and she honestly deserves all the best! Thank you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We just moved to our new apartment on the hottest weekend ever in the history of weather. We were tired, did not want to go anywhere and had a mean hankering for burgers.  The only place that delivers burgers near us is Oggi's. We were reluctant and for good reason.  The delivery said it would get to us an hour after we ordered it.  The delivery guy ends up calling us over an hour later and is lost.  We give him the proper directions and he calls us back 15 minutes later.  He says he is parked by the pool.  This is delivery. Park your car, get out and deliver the food to our door. My husband went and got the food because it had been an hour and a half by this time.  The burger was not hot and subpar. The fries were soggy.  It was a disappointing experience.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in on Monday for a quick salad! Decided to self seat at the bar. From the moment I walked in everyone was friendly. Bartender James is pretty awesome. Nice guy, knows his stuff. Got the Cali Cobb salad. Great flavored. Dude garlic knots so amazing. Check it out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza was not a great as expected.  Parking is not the best.  Great place since its walk able distance from my house so i can grab a couple drinks and walk home.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is our go-to place for moderately priced micro brew suds and pub food. 
My husband is a craft beer enthusiast and this place boasts a nice, ever-changing selection of micro brews on tap. 
They also brew a handful of their own beers and they are usually quite good. The porters and red are my husband's favorite. 
I'm a  cider fanataic and they have that as well. 
I really enjoy their pizza and calzones. Also the salads and sandwiches are good . 
The bread, whether it's the pizza dough or cheese-laden Oggy sticks or just the little nugget you get with the salads.. is awesome. 
The mini cheesecake dessert is worth saving room for as well and definitely check out the lunch specials. 
If its crowded  or if you are outside on the patio, the service sometimes slower for bigger groups. 
They really seem to value their customers.. wait staff will take the time to patiently explain the beer selection to my hard of hearing husband.
For the times they have missed something (or the holiday they said they'd be open but were closing up when we got there 15 mins later) we always get a comped appetizer or discount.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">James is the best bartender here. We have had great experiences here and James always makes sure to show us attentive service. The food is fantastic and the beer is always cold. Our service is always fantastic.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love the food here. Our waitress,  Jasmine, was outstanding. Loved the chicken limone.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Currently sitting here waiting for the waiter to take our order....17 minute after having been sat and handed out drinks! I would understand if the place was full or even busy but this is ridiculous!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My second time here. I came in for lunch.I'm giving this place only 1 star simply because the bar tender was being EXTREMELY aggressive and rude. He kept complaining and CURSING loudly in front of customers about how much he needed to get out of there. I can see why he was frustrated, but come on man, don't make your customers feel uncomfortable or unwelcomed. If I hadn't been so hungry I think I would've probably left somewhere else. It is a fast paced restaurant,  if you can't hang or don't have enough staff to help you with running the restaurant at a standard then let your manager know or put in your 2 weeks bro!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am so happy that this place is close to my house. I use to visit the one in HB when i would visit the inlaws. However, that closed down about a couple years ago. Since then i haven't visited any other locations in the fear of it not being the same. This time i checked this one out is because i figure its close to my house and if it turns into a great experience and great taste. I would be able to make it one of my favorite pizza places. Now i have another choice for Pizza and they DELIVER!! Woo-Hoo! im a happy girl. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just ordered delivery from here and was sadly disappointed. The fries we received were cold and soggy- no crisp at all... The sandwiches wee just thrown together- also soggy, and That pasta Alfredo had no taste until the after taste of pepper... Just a very mediocre lunch overall - not worth the calories for me or my dogs.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's been... some months now. No refund as previously promised by management. This place is evidently run by mischievous spirits disguised as hospitality workers. If you go into a darkened room and say "Oggi's" three times in front of a mirror, congratulations! You have approximated the experience of trying to get any sort of response from these goofballs. Plus now you're in a darkened room, so be careful where you step.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">By far the best food ive ever eaten. The manager there is one of the best people ive ever met. The staff there are great too. Jasmine the manager made the night one of the most enjoyable night of my Family's life. Its been a long time since  the wife and I have been able to go out and thanks to Jasmine we had a blast. If I could rate higher I would. If you dont believe me then try for yourself. Ten thumbs up for their world class customer service and desserts. I ate the texas burger and it was in the top 5 best burgers I have ever eaten. I have traveled around the U.S. and this is a new favorite for places to eat. Thanks again to the staff there for making tonight so memorable. Also I tried their beer and WOW, it was amazing. Everyone needs to try it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this Oggies. My husband and I are big Oggies fans and, always went to the one by our hose in Orange until It closed. Sinc ethen we have gone to the one in Garden Grove a few times but it was meh... Went to the Fullerton last Friday night and loved it. The food was great, the service even better. Our server/bartender Lacie,  did a great job. We could see that she was very busy but, never missed a beat in making us feel comfortable and providing good service. We also met the manager (cant remember her name, sorry) but, she was also very friendly and accommodating. We will defiantly be back and, we will be bringing the gang with us. Thanks Oggies.. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love Jasmine A.! Provided great customer service when I was in a rush in ordering to go to prepare for my hiking trip tomorrow. I didn't know that you have to dine in to get the free oggi sticks deal, but she let me get it anyway and she was so nice accommodating me as I'm waiting and sitting in the bar, offering drinks, and I didn't know that the oggi sticks would be so big and warm, and she got me napkins so it wouldn't be so hot as I'm holding it haha. Love her humor and consideration! Great experience! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Jasmine our waitress is awesome. She was friendly and informative. It was a pleasure having her service us.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome pizza and wings!! And their Oggi bread!! Paid like 30 bucks for an half dozen order of spicy BBQ wangs and a medium 6 topping pizza. Worth it! The Oggi bread was free with our order bc of a check in. That bread was delicious! It was cheesy, soft and mildly garlicky. The pizza was really good too. The veggies were more on the raw side, but that's ok with me bc I like the crunch. Very thick crust which I loved, and the ranch was so bomb and didn't taste like Kraft or hidden valley. It tasted home made!! The wangs were very very delicious and had sesame seeds on top. They weren't all fatty like most pizza places give them to you, they were real meaty wangs! Hit the spot for sure. Only part I didn't like was the marinara sauce.. Not sure if the beer I was drinking messed w my taste buds or not, but that marinara sauce was not the business. Anyway, totally worth checking out when you don't want the usual dominos, Pizza Hut, or papa Juan's! Enjoy!

Ps: as much as I love this place, there were 3 occasions where the employees were NOT 4 star worthy. Once, I called to ask what time they closed to make sure (yelp said 12) and the employee answered the phone saying 11. It was a Friday night so I'm sure she only said that bc she didn't wanna be stuck there. Rude. Another two separate occasions, we actually WENT and "management" said they were closed despite having another 2 hours to go. Not a way to run business if you ask me. Hopefully this doesn't happen to you!! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Me and my boyfriend came here for dinner  are server was great very attentive pizza was very good we got a meat lover style pizza great draft beers love that almost all the games we're on the big screens very nice clean bathrooms which is a plus I liked it a lot will come back anytime I'm in Fullerton<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I should've checked the yelp reviews before simply ordering since I had some great coupons. Unfortunately, I didn't. So 1 hour and 15 minutes after ordering the pizza arrived---cool, not hot, and not quite cold. We ordered 2 pizzas and 1 lb of wings for delivery. I live less than 2 miles from this place so they should've been able to deliver our order in 45 min or less. Whatever, I hoped the food would at least be worth the wait--it wasn't. The pizza looked good to the eyes, but the taste was far from acceptable. The crust was fluffy yet bland and cardboard like in mouthfeel. The sauce was bland as well. The cheese was mediocre and the toppings were only so-so. The wings were on the large side, but very fatty and grisly. So, to sum the experience (or lack of), I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. You can have the same experience and save about $10 by going to Little Caesars (which also sucks, but at least you expect it to taste like it does because the price is so low). 

Save your money and order elsewhere :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decent enough but not particularly blown away.  I ordered online for delivery. They do have a high minimum as another reviewer mentioned but it's free delivery so it balanced out. Our order was accurate and arrived on time. The food was good but fairly standard pub fare. 
Overall, it was a good experience and I will probably order from them again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here before with 2 friends and loved it...beer was ice cold and the garlic knots were tasty. We went last night with a much larger group and we were assigned 1 server. Service was so slow :( took 20 minutes or more for our first round of beers?? Why? Not quite sure what happens behind the scenes. Manager was helpful and kind when I told him the knots were dry and had no garlic flavor. He kindly replaced them but the new batch was not much better :( The other food orders seemed good. Large groups order much more food and drink when there's an attentive server or two. Wish we had that. Other than that, I would probably go back with a smaller party.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The servers were so helpful and we got tons of deals. Jasmine told us all about the promotions and Zack was such an attentive server. We never had to wait for more beer or pizza. We had the oggis sticks (garlic cheese sticks) and the Triathalon (californian chicken club).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow this place has some of the best wings, burgers and pizza I've ever tried I highly recommend it. Great spot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Two stars for the nice older woman with blonde hair (manager?). Zero stars for the unpleasant and blantantly rude girl with short hair and a sleeve at the counter thinking we misunderstood when we asked the nice manager lady for veggie patties, which she confirmed they did have. Also, we asked if we could sub portobello mushroom for the pattie and she said no. That's the easiest substitution.  My first time there and my last.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was good not great! The new light lasagna roll was tasty. Pizza was Oggis Soecial and lacked luster. Biggest complaint terribly slow on drink deliveries, not once, not twice, three times! Time to go and can't find waitress again for our check. Not only are the drinks way slow, the waitress has no idea how rude it is to disappear and not apologize. So wrong Sarah G .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We have eaten at this location several times and always got pizza and drinks. This
time we decided to forgo the pizza. We ordered an appetizer of buffalo wings, a parmesan patty melt and fettuccini alfredo with chicken. The buffalo wings were supposed to be a pound for $10.99. The plate they brought out had 6 scrawny wings
that weren't enought for one person. We really should have had them taken back. When you think about it with tax and tip, those 6 wings cost about $15.00. Ridiculous!
We should have sent back the fettuccini as well. The noodles and what appeared to
be chicken were literally swimming in alfredo sauce. It was really disgusting. The patty melt was the best of the lot but we would never get it again. It was so dried out we
needed to add way too much 1000 island dressing to make it eatable. If and when
we go back, it will definitely be pizza only. It still burns me about those wings though.
How can a restaurant even serve something like that?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Disappointing. Bar was not fully stocked (no mint or ginger ale), and the rum&coke was all rum and a drop of coke... awful really. Sliders mediocre and fries cold. Slow service.<p>
