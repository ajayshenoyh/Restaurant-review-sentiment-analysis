<p itemprop="description">My absolute favorite KBBQ joint, but why must it be so far from me (Costa Mesa)?! If you can I'd come here on a weekday for lunch because it's significantly cheaper or right around 5pm on a weekend and you'll be okay too.

Recommendations: BEEF BELLY, BEEF BELLY & MORE BEEF BELLY!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr. BBQ was originally recommended by my BF's close friend who lives in OC. The BF and I have known this place for a little over a year now, and ever since we ate here for the first time, we always make a trip here whenever we're traveling down south! It's truly our favorite AYCE korean bbq ever!! We're meat lovers and have been to many AYCE places, and the one and only Mr. BBQ will forever win our stomachs!

There's something about the meats that tastes so flavorful, juicy, and fresh! Nothing on the menu lacks any flavor, everything is just so damn good! Hands down so so much better than Gen. Oh and I can't forget how great the staff and service is here. Everyone is so nice and food is always served on time and they never made any mistakes whenever we visit. There's really nothing more I can say to convince anyone to try Mr. BBQ. The food will speak for itself once you try it. So what are you waiting for! GO TRY MR. BBQ NOW!! You won't be disappointed! I would give it 10 stars if I could bahaha.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Compared to other AYCE places, Mr. BBQ is most similar to Gen in quality and options. The lunch price is $16 but if it's a Sunday, you will be charged the dinner price of $24. 

My favorite meats were the pork belly, beef brisket, and pork kalbi. There were a lot of side dishes and none stood out. The rice sheets tasted slightly old and stiff. You're better off wrapping your meat with the pink radish or eating it with rice. The tenjang chigae was super light. 

What stands out here is the service. Even when the restaurant was full, our server came by many times to check up on us and always got what we asked for in a timely manner. There was a fly when we first sat down (not on the grill) and they comp'ed us 25% for that! Unheard of.

I'm getting to the point where I feel like it's worth paying the extra for good quality, non-AYCE Korean BBQ. The difference is worth the additional cost.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ive actually been to Mr. BBQ over a dozen times in the past that im surprised ive never written a review.

I came here today for lunch with my brother and have probably received the best service ive ever had at any Korean BBQ and ive been eating KBB for almost 10 years!! 

We got in around 1pm and was seated right away.  Our server was Patrick and he was nothing less than awesome!  Literally everything we needed he either got it for us right away or had someone else get it for us.  He always made sure our grill was full of meat, our sides were always full, our waters were never empty, and our dipping sauces were always full. My brother and I always ask for a small foil container with oil and garlic and he also made sure our garlic never ran out. He exemplifies what customer service is and Mr BBQ is lucky to have this guy working for them.  

On to the food...we ordered our usual (for any KBB restaurant) brisket and prime steak.  I dont know what it was about this batch of brisket but it was better than before.  It was more flavorful and juicy.  Our server even got us a really thick cut of the steak that was very tender and juicy.  The sides were all good like always. The vanilla ice cream at the end topped it off perfectly although i wish they wouldve had green tea ice cream today.

The ambiance is very nice.  Nicely decorated and they even have some games you can play in the waiting area while waiting for your table.  All the servers come together to do a birthday song and dance for any birthday celebrants in the restaurant.

Ill definitely be coming back.


p.s.  if Mr BBQ management reads this...your server Patrick deserves a raise.  He really did an excellent job. I hope he's me server every time i go there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr. BBQ has been suggested to me by multiple people such as my foodie friend Charlie, but the stories I heard about their wait time always put a stop for me to actually try the place. At last, bunch of our friends decided to come out so we finally got an excuse to go. 

The wait time was about 45 minutes on a Saturday night, parking was horrible, in Chinese term, it was "people mountain people sea"! Good news is the little vibrater we got from them could be reached at the bar next door so our 45 minutes went by quick. 

After we were seated , we decided to try their PAYCE at $31.99 per person to experience the highest quality food they could provide. Most of our items were beef and seafood. We also tried the sausage and one chicken dish. As usual, chicken took forever to cook. I didn't really like their beef tongue either... It wasn't bad, but if I didn't care for a second plate, you know something was off. I would highly recommend the scallop, ribeye, and filet mignon. Stay away from salmon though. 

The eating environment was like chilling at party USA. There was a birthday song playing every 10 to 20 minutes. I kind of feel bad for the staff because on top of their normal duties, they are also obligated to sing and dance for the customers. I wonder what the job description is for their positions.

The service was really good. Friendly, fast, and helpful. I get it, Mr. BBQ, we would come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lets not beat around the bush, the wait here is nuts. Like I felt clinically insane for driving from West LA to Fullerton then waiting 2 hours to eat. By the time my friend and I were seated we were a pinky toe away from cannibalism. All that said I see why my friend insisted on this spot over my usually kbbq place in Torrance. Their customer service alone is worth it. They are supper nice and attentive. I hesitantly asked the hostess for water while I was waiting with a smile she handed me a water bottle and genuinely apologized for the wait time. The meat selections were delicious and clearly good quality. My friend was able to get an entire steak in addition to all the other meat for all of $24. They were super quick with refills of everything and clearing away plates with out being asked.

Be warned this place is NOT quite. Like at all. They do some sort of birthday song every 5 minutes on weekend nights. 

I can't say I would drive out from West LA again just for this but since i have a Disneyland pass I can def see myself coming over here after building up an appetite at the parks. Would definitely recommend to others!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">BEST AYCE KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANT I've ever been to, and I've tried alot, trust. For $23.99 you get premium choices of meat AND seafood and it's definitely worth every penny. I'm from SD and my go to is Manna BBQ and every other restaurant has never  even come close to it.. until now.. topping it. In SD they've basically discontinued beef tongue there so AYCE is disappointing for me since that's my go to. The meats here are soo good! 

Highly recommend the beef tongue and beef belly, the brisket is good too if you don't overcook it. We also tried the wagyu short rib and that was just okay. I totally forgot until now to try the other meats but honestly the beef belly, tongue, brisket were so good we just didn't bother to try others. The meats were good quality, had good cuts, and didn't feel frozen.

Cons: Steamed egg was overcooked, some of the beef belly was fatty but nothing too bad.

Overall, everything was exceptional. My server was Vanessa and she was super helpful and had great service. Meats were super good and there were alot of sides. Def coming back whenever I'm in the area!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The search is over! Mr. BBQ takes the crown for best AYCE Korean barbeque in Orange County. There, I said it. 

I've waited long enough to see what this highly rated phenomenon is all about. Add to it a 2-hour wait time upon getting our name down on the list, the suspense was killing me. Thanks to the Back Room which is a bar located behind the restaurant as that made our time go by after having a couple of drinks before our buzzer went off. 

Unbeknownst to me, I was already getting bored with KBBQ despite my monthly trips to AYCE joints. How did the cat come out of the bag? Well, I ate here. Premium quality makes the bar go higher when consuming anything and so does the price tag. For $23.99 on weekends and dinner, I promise it is money you won't be sorry spending. 

Their BRISKET comes with a hint of flavor even though it is not labeled marinated on the menu, and that threw me off in a very, very good way. BEEF BELLY, how I love thee! The layers of fat add scrumptiousness to the "enth" level - think bacon, but a red meat version of it. Which brings me next to their PORK BELLY and how you should over cook the entire slab until it's golden and crispy. Cut them in pieces for a more crunchy effect and I assure you, you will have gone to bacon heaven and back. WAGYU BEEF TONGUE, anyone? This delicate piece of meat has made me fall for it, big time. Cook it just enough for a melt-in-your-mouth experience. 101% recommended. For a similar tender mouth feel, the BABY SQUID is not to be missed. I ordered this on the latter part of our meal which was a little too late to stuff myself with it. Don't make that mistake. 

Now on to the supporting role. What a glorious BAN CHAN spread they have here. All my favorites they offer - potato salad, jap chae noodles, steamed egg, fish cakes, pink radish wraps, you name it, they have it. And the service - WOW! Their crew was stellar across the board, efficient and friendly. For those celebrating a birthday, they'd be so happy to embarrass you with a song and treat you with a scoop of ice cream. But really, everyone on the table gets ice cream with or without a birthday but what fun is that without the singing? Hah! 
 
So much revelation was to be had this evening and the most important thing of all...Mr BBQ lives up to the hype and deserves all the attention it is getting.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What keeps us coming back? Read the reviews and you'll see a common thread: service!

Sure there are tons of other AYCE Korean BBQs in the Fullerton area, but Mr. BBQ has been compared to Gen for superior quality meats and service. The latter is the main reason why we keep coming back. That, and the plethora of TVs. No matter where you're sitting, you'll have a great view of the sporting event playing that day. 

Service: fast and efficient. You'll seldom have to ask for your grill to be turned up or down or to have your grill switched out. The servers will check on you often, and come by to cut up your meats. 

Food: We went with the premium menu for $31.99 which is everything on the $23.99 menu plus higher-end items like galbi, filet mignon, wagyu, ribeye, pork jowl, salmon, & scallops.  Even though we upgraded this time, we have been equally satisfied with the $23.99 menu. 

The filet mignon was good! So were the beef belly (thinly sliced and similar to the brisket only fattier), brisket, and thick cut pork belly.  Personal preference but I like to cook the latter two until they're really crispy, then wrap them in rice paper. The galbi was not very flavorful and was just okay. 

Between the two of us, we shared about 9 plates and were too full to try the ribeye, wagyu or pork jowl that were also on the premium list. Talk about epic FAILURE on our part.  Do yourself a favor if you upgrade and order from the premium list first, otherwise you'll be living in remorse the day after like me.

Drinks:  Since it was Monday night football, we had to indulge in beer! $26 for a pitcher of Hoegaarden.  Served with chilled glasses.  The soju sampler is $15, and you can select up to three flavors. To me, they were too sweet but the popular flavors are the lychee and yogurt. 

Bathroom: It was packed that night, and I don't think anyone was on restroom patrol. The women's restroom was a total wreck. Minus one star.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is now one of my new fav kbbq spots out of all the ones I've tried by far. So many selections to choose from. We went on a Sunday around 12pm and the wait was around 15 mins which wasn't bad. Our server Sean was amazingggg. We didn't have to ask for anything. He was so attentive and got to it before we could even ask. Yay! A lot of birthday celebrations here. Maybe one every 10 mins when we were there. Def do recommend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My boss took everyone out for lunch and this is where we ended up. I'm told that this place is always pretty busy but we didn't have to wait to be seated. 

Our order was taken right away and they immediately brought out all the sides. Like any Korean bbq, you cook it yourself. Employees are really good at replacing the cooking surface throughout your meal. This place has become a go to for Korean bbq. The food is delicious and you won't be disappointed!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my second time dining here..... Of course the wait is one hour to one hour and a half.  The place is packed and full of awesome aroma of meat on the grill.  
Don't get carried away with their dishes and order slowly.  No matter which menu you choose, you will get a very good selection of meats and dishes.  Be sure to try their chicken!!! They are tasty and tender all around.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Honestly, I don't know where to start.  Hands down one of the BEST KBBQ spot around.  Pricey but definitely worth the money for sure!  My boyfriend and I eat there once every 2 weeks for date night.  He works odd hours so we spend our time together talking and eating enjoying each other's company.  It's loud in there but we love it!  And we love how they  celebrate birthdays.  awesome customer service and are very attentive.  Kudos Mr. BBQ.  

What we order usually:
Beef Belly
Miso Pork Belly
Large Intestines 
Tofu Pot and Egg Pot
Spicy Squid
Steak
Finger Ribs
Shrimps<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr BBQ is one of the more expensive AYCE Korean barbeque joints, but it's worth it.  Quality of meats is great, and service is great.  The only thing not great is the wait time.  But hey, they're #27 on Yelp's Top 100!  That's pretty good for a kbbq place coming from Fullerton, California, as opposed to k-town in downtown LA.

Foodie tip: enjoy your meat even more by asking for the salt & sesame oil and dip all your meat in it.  It's so good.  It goes best with non-marinated meats like brisket or pork belly.  

My recommendation for this place is to try them during lunch.  They don't have as many choices on the lunch menu, but it's more affordable and you still get good quality meats.  You also don't have to wait 2+ hours.  One time I got here at 8 pm; they told me the wait time was an hour but the kitchen closes by 9 pm.  That kinda puts us in a tough position..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My wife doesn't eat enough to validate us going to AYCE joints, but my brother was in town recently, and since he was craving KBBQ, we decided to check this place out.

The wait was a little over an hour on a Saturday night. While we ended up having a fantastic meal here, it'll be hard to justify waiting that long every time I want KBBQ.

With that said, I do have to note that this was definitely one of the better AYCE joints I can remember.

First of all, shortly after we were seated, as they brought out the side dishes, they also brought a plate for my 3 year old daughter filled with rice, veggies, and a juice box. I've never seen a restaurant do that without having us ask for these things. It was a simple gesture that made a world of difference for me and my wife.

As extensive as the $23.99 AYCE menu was, we ended up only getting four different cuts of meat: the Thinly Sliced Prime Beef Brisket, Premium Beef Belly, Premium Wagyu Finger Short Ribs, and the Premium Cut Fresh Pork Belly. 

I'd recommend skipping the chadol altogether, as it didn't stand out from other KBBQ joints. 
Since there was no galbi option on this particular menu, I'd say the Short Ribs were a nice alternative option. 

I was surprised by the samgyupsal; I normally expect this level of quality at non-AYCE KBBQ restaurants. I didn't try any of the other flavored porky bellies, but I didn't mind, as this satisfied me quite well.

Lastly, that beef belly. Wow. I wouldn't have ordered this had my cousin not recommended and ordered it. It was slightly marinated and it just melted in my mouth. I went crazy with this, ordering it four or five times. This cut alone was the reason I didn't get to venture out to the other types of meat. I would return for this alone.

Service was so much better than other AYCE places I've been to. And yes, it gets loud in there (and that happy birthday thing they do is pretty obnoxious). But that won't prevent me from coming back again. The beef belly outweighs the cons of the long wait and noise level inside the restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3.5 stars - pretty solid for ayce BBQ. I think I might have been expecting a bit more given it was so highly rated. We had a group of 10 and waited about 1.5 hours. I like that they allow you to leave and call them to check your spot, so we went over to get boba nearby to spend time.

My definite favorite meat was the Mr.BBQ- it was marinated steak that was very tender to eat. The brisket and spicy garlic pork butt were yummy too. Side dishes were ok - pretty average. The steamed egg had a rubbery texture and soy bean paste soup was way too salty.

One annoying thing to prepare for when eating here is the happy birthday song they play for all the birthdays. It's really loud and doesn't sound great. :p

Service was attentive and price was fair.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came for dinner at 7pm on a Saturday and ended up waiting for over 1.5 hours. There are two price points, $23.99 for normal meats or $31.99 for "premium" meafs, which includes galbi, sirloin, salmon and other options. Our group felt like it wasn't worth an extra $8 and went with the cheaper option. 

Our group of 10 had two grills to work with so that made cooking much more efficient and also allowed us to order more food at once! My favorite meat of the night was brisket. Fast to cook, easy to eat, tasted delicious. Steamed egg was also very well made.

Service here was top notch and our server was very quick in putting in our meat orders and restocking the rice paper and other sides.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place offers by far the best value in AYCE KBBQ.  The Premium tier is an amazing deal at $31.99.  You get all the standard fare plus some amazing cuts of meat.  Black Angus NY Strip Steak, Prime Rib Eye, Filet Mignon, Scallops, Pork Jowl, and Marinated Beef Short Ribs.  Oh there's salmon in this tier too if you care about that.  The 11 dudes I was with could careless for salmon we're not bears.  We went through 10 Rib eyes, 10 NY's, 4 Filet's and countless dishes of pork jowl, and beef ribs.  This was the best KBBQ experience I've ever had.  

Another bright spot here is the service.  Servers are very attentive, bring out dishes fast, and are on top of everything.  They always offer to cut the meat that's cooking, and they are ready with the grill change before you ask for it.

You like to have drinks while you're having amazing steaks?!  They got you covered with that too.  They offer handcrafted Korean spirits and cocktails, and beer towers!  They offer Bootleggers on tap a Fullerton favorite!  Can't beat that.  

The only reason I am not handing out FIVE stars is due to the parking lot being too small for the size of the restaurant, and the men's room needed attention.  Wait times are long, but what KBBQ isn't.  This place is well worth the wait.  There's a Gastropub in the back to kill time so that's a plus, or you can wait inside the restaurant in the waiting they have cards, and Jenga to keep you busy.  Other than that the food and service is 5 stars.  I will definitely be back sooner rather than later.

One final thought.  They sing happy birthday like every 10 mins, that gets annoying kind of fast.  Something tells me people lie about birthday's just to have the crew come out and sing, and make a big deal for a few seconds.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have a bone to pick with these KBBQ restaurants man! If you read my other reviews you can tell I eat a lot of KBBQ and the equation I use for a KBBQ review is Service+Meat Quality+Price= KBBQ Restaurant Quality.

-So the service is amazing the staff are very friendly and nice and they REALLY sing and dance to you for your birthday. They really dance too, not like that fake celebration dancing where they sing and clap to you lackadaisically then scurry back off to their job. One girl even hit the whip on me. 

-This is the part I got a bone to pick, which is about their meat quality (no pun intended). So I'm gonna start off by saying all their meat is very good and is above average quality and taste. I can't be the only one to notice though, that after a couple rounds of meats, they start serving a less quality version of the same meat, like they will be more dry or less fatty etc. It's just not the same meats that they served in the very beginning. I guess they are hoping that as you're getting more full you don't notice that the quality of the food is going down and you might even blame your own judgement since you are full.Y'all think y'all slick but you can't fool me.

-That is the main reason why I gave this place a 4 star instead of 5 because other than that I really like this place and the price is well worth the quality. Overall I really recommend this place, but be prepared to wait as I recall talking to a server one time about that, and she said that they always have a wait time during dinner everyday. The only time you can come without waiting is weekdays at lunch time according to her. I have been here around 5 times and I can say that the average wait time for me is an hour but I come during dinner time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Orange County Korean Barbecue in it's complete & total glory. 

I am usually on top of my Kbeebz game in OC so I must sadly admit I am just now getting around to this year-plus old bookmark for a spot held in such regard it earned special recognition from Yelp as well at hour plus wait times so long that they could make the guys over at Gen blush. It is your typical all you can eat format but it offers supreme service for the genre. Also, the interior is somewhere between fun and a bit sophomoric. I went with the $23.99 menu and will never do otherwise going forward. 

Mr. BBQ offers an dizzying array of 17 banchan to go along with your meats or to simply nosh on in between the Kbeebz charring sessions. I absolutely adore their kimchi, japchae, and potato salad. Another one of the most notable dishes is the house salad which is a crunchy lettuce with fresh onions and carrots, lightly dressed in a spicy sauce. 

Yes I said salad, try it and tell me that I am wrong. 

On to the protein - you know, why you are reading this damn review for anyway. Mr. BBQ transcends their peer group in Orange County and battles admirably in the legendary KTown scene (yes - I said it) in the red meat department. The ribeye is bold and perfectly seasoned. Sure, it is too fatty but they give you scissors for god's sake and it is all you can eat - who cares? The woobeasal (beef belly) is incredible alone and worth dying for with a splash of the supplied oil. The chadol, thinly sliced prime beef brisket, is tender and pairs well with the brisket sauce and a dash of seasoning salt. For those who love marinated meat, the bulgogi will satisfy with its marinated choice chuck that practically falls off the bone.

The staff is wicked quick with a grill change and they make the beer flow like an avalanche... you know... rolling down a mountain. All. Meal. Long. 

Mr. BBQ is my new favorite Kbeebz spot in OC but the trek to Fullerton will probably have me at Gen and Shik Do Rak far more often. Still, it really is a culinary jewel.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fun place , the wait is way too long. Nice variety of food, fast service once you are seated. Great for groups. Best part is when the staff sings happy birthday to people. Loved the meat over the chicken .
Great over all .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of the best KBBQ restaurants I have been to in Orange County. From meat quality to customer service, this establishment is off the charts amazing!

Our server Shawn was incredibly polite and conscientious---he was on top of grill changes, always made sure we had our orders put in at a timely manner, and often checked up on us to make sure we were okay. He definitely made my family and I's experience here, a great one.

The quality of the food is superb! The one thing I really do like though is the amount of sides we get and the amount of times the servers were willing to refill them. Often times when I go to a KBBQ restaurant, they are super stingy and are anal about food loss, but the Mr. BBQ crew were very giving.

This place is also a pretty awesome place to celebrate a birthday. The restaurant goes all out when singing you Happy Birthday and you even get a free sweet treat. This place is great for groups, so make sure to bring everybody for the celebration. 

Next time I pay a visit to Orange County, I just have to go to this place again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food: all you can eat 31.99 menu 
Service: 6 stars
Parking: lot

Reasons....
Where do I begin.. Mr.  BBQ is probably my go to AYCE BBQ because they simply have the best and they don't compromise.  Meat quality has been solid since day one and they continually keep the level of quality, which is why the price is so steep. Some people might say it's not worth, but to me, it's worth it.  No other BBQ joints serves Filet as a part of their AYCE menu and it just tastes incredibly delicious. In addition,  they have a wide variety of side dishes that taste Aiites, probably the only thing in my opinion they need to work on. 
Now in terms service,  JT and Kevin were absolutely unbelievable. They were friendly, quick, and made serving look like cake walk. Like seriously,  they would know what I want before I even knew what I needed. Its like they went into the future and talked to my 5 min forward future me lol. 
Overall it was indeed a great handful of  experiences and thus review was long overdue.  I recommend y'all get the expensive menu and feast on that. It's so much more worth. 

Would I come back? Of course!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food (5): Very good quality KBBQ especially for a place that is far away from the main SGV area or Koreatown. Fullerton is not known for good asian food, but the KBBQ here was great. The meat quality was good. I specifically liked the quality of the pork belly and the chicken. Side dishes were good as well.

Service (4): Typical good KBBQ service. The waiters are always attentive and friendly.

Price (4): Reasonable pricing for what you get at a KBBQ and the quality.

Ambiance (2): I know KBBQs are typically loud, but his one was overly loud. And I swear to god, every 10 minutes was someone's birthday. How do I know? Because every 10 minutes they do that loud birthday song. It was not a good place to talk to friends without having to shout.

Others: Make note that there is a very long line for this place. I won't mark down the place for this, but it was an hour plus wait. It's large inside, but people who go to KBBQ do typically take an hour or so to finish eatting. And when it's that packed inside and out, that just means this place is popular.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pros: Good meat selections and flavors.

Cons: Parking, Wait time, super loud all the time, bland soups, sides, and salad. 

I get it. The place is busy. They have a good selection of meats, it's really close to Cal State Fullerton, and they have a party vibe there.

However, that does not excuse THIS particular server on THIS particular day to to give us SUBPAR service.  Well, it even subpar, it was avoidance.  

At first I gave the server the benefit of the doubt.  Although, when I, my wife witnessed, brother, sister and sister in law witnessed the server being cheery with other tables then there is a problem.  If we have to flag down multiple servers to place an order for a soda, for extra meat or for extra sides then there is a problem.  

As I mentioned earlier, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Yes the servers here are all busy, but if multiple servers have to pick up the slack, ask for help, BE COURTEOUS, and let us know. Then there wouldn't be a problem. PROBLEM SOLVED! 

So, if you're willing to wait on average 45-90 for a table, like screaming at each other for conversation, hearing a "birthday song" every 10 minutes then this joint is for you! On the plus side though like I said before, they do have good meat. 

As for myself, I dont think I will be returning here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came back here and it was good like last time, but my opinion of them has changed because of their business practices. The server LIED to us when we asked for more of a particular side, the creamy seaweed dish. She said there was no more without hesitation. 

But when she went on break, I decided to try and ask another server for more and she brought out a huge mound of it. Maybe she didn't get the memo that each table is only allowed one refill of creamy seaweed.  We sat near the kitchen and we saw a huge container of it. 

This is a common practice in Korean / Asian establishments. They say they don't have anymore of a particular item when it is kinda expensive. But c'mon, this is an AYCE and we just paid $32 per person for dinner. 

This really makes me question their honesty and business practices. They also told us they were out of the spicy squid, but we saw another group get it after we were denied. 

What's up Mr. BBQ? Why do you guys have to lie?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is the model of what good service looks like. Their servers always seem to be one step ahead of what you need. 

It's absolutely worth the sometimes long wait. Try the beef belly and the brisket!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Loved our server, Sean (w/2hearts)! He was enthusiastic, encouraged us to try something new, and was super sweet!

Also, the steak here is bomb! Great quality meat and amazing service!

Totally worth the price!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Maybe it was too hyped bc everyone and their mom in the OC come to this spot. I thought it was a $10, no more than  $15 ayce type spot but it was $20+. No biggie, but with places like Gen that aren't that much higher in price, I'd rather go there. They did have a pretty good variety of meats though. Also there's a massive wait and limited parking, good news is there's a bar next door to help pass the time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would say the best Korean BBQ place Orange County has to offer. Better than Gen in my opinion. If you have the patience to withstand the long wait, it will definitely be worth it! Fortunately for our first time here we only had to wait 30 minutes which was a breeze in comparison to how long others have waited. We opted for the $24 per person dinner option which had plenty of items to select from. 

Pros: 
1. Meat Quality: I would say my go to meat option for any KBBQ place is the beef brisket. The standard to any good KBBQ place. This place has amazing brisket. Perfect marble. The key is to not overcook any of the meats. Even better than the brisket was the beef belly. So bomb once you get these nice and crispy. I could eat these for days. The sirloin was also very good as it was flavorful and tender. The brisket, beef belly, and the sirloin were the top 3 for sure. 

2. Customer Service: Top notch! Our server Drew was awesome. He constantly checked up on us to see if we needed anything. He was on point changing out our grill when it started to get dirty. He must have changed our grill at least a handful of times. Not to mention they were lightning fast in bringing out our meat orders. This place has the best customer service of any KBBQ restaurant I've been to. They even collectively gather around and dance when it's someone's birthday. Props! However which leads me to...

Cons: 
1. Birthdays: once or twice can be interesting and fun. They have all the workers gather around the birthday table and dance for a minute or so. However, once it becomes 3 or more times it can be a bit annoying so be prepared if you happen to go during a busy birthday weekend. You've been warned. 

To top it all off they give you some green tea ice cream at the end and it was the perfect dessert. Light and airy to help cleanse your palate. 

Definitely will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is the best!!! The food is so good and the service is amazing!  Waiters are super attentive and they're so friendly and helpful! I've come here multiple times and each time the service just gets better and better! After our food we got up and at the door my mother had forgotten to take her medication but the girl in the front reception was on top of it with a convenient tiny water bottle! So nice!
Defiantly coming back :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You don't need to drive into LA for some great KBBQ.  There is no question, this is the place to be for AYCE KBBQ in the Fullerton/OC area.  

Coming in for a weekend dinner? Expect at least an hour+ wait.  No worries though, you can either grab a seat inside the waiting area and play cards to pass the time.  Or, you can make like me and go next door to sip upon the mighty tasty Enjoy By IPA's (they go quick!).  Also worth mentioning, the staff here was extremely accommodating to our party (even at the volume of customers).  

That hour passed and we all got seated.  Once you cross the other side of the register, it's like stepping into a VIP room.  Looking around, with the biggest grin on your face, you can't help it.  The sides quickly came out and the serve quickly took our order (this became a natural process here). 

The occasion was a birthday party and the guy nearly screwed it up. Don't know his name but he was a short fellow. They will ask for a Facebook or ID and I showed him her FB. I initially went over to him to make it very discreet so the birthday girl wouldn't know then a little later he came over to double check even when we were both on the same page on who it was. She didn't know so we were all good! Also, they will wait until you're almost finished before they celebrate. That's at least what the hostess told me when I asked. 

For the menu. They have an A ($23.99) and B ($31.99) menu. With B, you get all of A plus some more premium meats such as filet mignon, king salmon, and beef short ribs. 

We choose A and that's good enough for me. I love the bulgogi and salad.. I can go through 3 or 4 bowls of salad easily. The meats were very fresh. So good. The brisket also had barely any fat on it and the meats are not frozen.

Solid place for KBBQ in the OC area. Especially if it's a birthday that is being celebrated.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went here for lunch the other day. We had the all you can eat lunch special. It was about $15. You get a ton of good options. Comes with a few small traditions Korean side dishes.

Most Korean places I go to, the wait is over and hour long, but we were able to get a table right away. Not sure if it's because it's lunch time, or if they're just very good with turn over. 

Service was ok. They're fairly busy, so they don't come around as often as I'd like, but still do come around to check unlike most Asian places.

All in all, good experience and will definitely be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3.5-4 stars. 

Was craving kbbq and our previous favorite place was rebranded so decided to give this place a try due to their reviews. Was exactly as expected! 

It's a little more expensive than other places I've been to but it's because they claim their meat selection to be "Premium Meats."  Honestly, I did not taste quality that was better than other places but their service was pretty good. 

We came on a Friday night at 9:30 and got seated in 15 minutes. Server checked on us often and made sure we were satisfied each time. 

Only thing I can say that i didn't like was that the birthday routine gets old after the 5th time you have to hear it. Lol<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place goes over the top in showmanship, customer service, and they serve great food too.....

After an exhausting day at Disneyland we happened upon this gem. List on the Yelp Top 100 Restaurants in the US as number 27. Upon arrival, we were given a pager and informed of a 1 hour wait time. They have a large wait area with tables, card games, and Genga. the interior is very flamboyant and clean. Friendly host staff and large wait staff. With a name of Mr BBQ i was pleased that each table had a bbq station and overhead vent.

We were seated and introduced to Sean. Great guy, knew his product, offered up recommendations, very attentive, and prompt with requests. They have a large $23.99 meat selection and a $31.99 premium meat option with a whole table policy pricing. If 1 person wants the premium the whole table is charged the higher price. i've been to many Korean BBQ joints and this is by far the best customer service we have experienced. They always had somebody available to assist your needs. Kinda reminded me of Fogo De Chao Steakhouse Service but their birthday shows go above and beyond with loud background music, songs, and lots of props.

We were immediately given an assortment of side dishes ranging from kimchee, seasoned sprouts, fish cakes, spicy pickled cucumbers, diakon radish, and marinated seaweed with some american dishes of sliced spicy potatoes, macaroni salad, and broccoli. a nice green leaf salad, meat dipping sauce with salt. We requested sesame oil to add to the salt, Korean Red Bean Paste (Adzuki Bean), Rice paper, garlic and jalapenos to add to the meat, Barley Water, and finally rice.Whats asian food without rice??? We are sooooo needy but they accommodated each and every request. Everything had unique flavors and complimented the meal.

they certainly live up to the Yelp rating. Our meats were well marinated seasoned, and flavorful, Service was so good that i'm mentioning it twice. we'll definitely be back and looking forward to trying the other options. it's worth the long wait.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Honestly, I could easily say that Mr BBQ is my favorite kbbq place. I've been to lots of kbbq place, and this so far is the best. The price is rather cheap for all the options it offers, and the meet us fresh every time I go there. Despite the rush hours, service is fast and accurate. I don't have to constantly make an effort to catch the servers' attentions (because some other places make it really difficult to place orders for more meet). 
Also, the side dishes that come with the meal is really good, and I would overall recommend this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is definitely different than 2 years ago. The meat, not the best, was actually AOK. The service was amazing...except for the guy who kept turning down the flame. They change the pan frequently without you asking. Kinda pricey for the quality, but the service was superb.

Overall, the changes have been for the better. I would definitely suggest coming for lunch to save a few bucks. Overall, I am a fan!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oh yeah, pan Chan galore! The decor is pretty hip, actually BRIGHT inside (take note Gen). You can choose from a regular or premium menu. I stuck with the regular menu, and was just fine. Good quality meat, the grill fire was nice and hot, attentive service, left here in a wheel barrow. Planning to come back here soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So still coming back, and it's still amazing! service rocks and the spicey pork butt and short ribs are killer<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time here and probably one of the best Korean BBQ around here. 

I mean filet mignon, rib eye steak, and scallop  as an all u can eat? So good.... it's a pretty  big portion  too.... if u decide to order the list w/ the filet and stuff  it cost extra but u can still pick from both lists.....its a lot of food choose from... I think it was a little under $32 a person....

Our waitress  was hands down the nicest gal I've meet....i forget her name but she was awesome... on top w/ refills and changing the grill pan....

I was a little confuse  w/ the restroom... there is a chicken and a cow picture for the restroom....i went into the chicken one since i was chick...maybe if I paid attention  to the color red chicken and blue cow....smh...food coma was creeping up....

This place gets packed ASAP.... we came on a Thursday around  5pm and by 530 most of the tables got filled.....

Will I return? Yes I will 100%...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">To be honest, we came back because the bulgogi made a really good impression on us. However, it seems like the meat quality is a hit and miss here. Like other reviewer said, during the second round, the meat that they give you seems like a leftover from the day before.

In the first round, we ordered 2 bulgogi and pork rib. The pork rib was perfectly marinated and tender! The bulgogi was a disappointment because It was dry and lacked of flavors. During the second round, they gave us a really good plate of bulgogi where it is soft and flavorful. However the pork ribbed was very fatty and wasn't as good as the first time.

Overall it was still good but I don't like that they serve a mix quality of meat during your meal, as if your suppose to only go for the first round.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I think I found my new favorite kbbq place! I heard the wait can be crazy, but my group of 4 came at 6pm on a Wednesday and there were still a few open tables. Lucky us!

The banchan were awesome, with japchae (glass noodles), potato salad, macaroni salad, bean sprouts... pretty much everything I like.

Then onto the meat... Mr. BBQ has plenty of choices and each were top quality. I usually order a ton of brisket, but here, I love the beef belly and beef tongue the most. We even got shrimp, which I hardly ever order because I'm too lazy to peel, but it was so delicious here, that I ended up peeling and eating about 5-6.

In addition, the salad and spicy tofu soup mixed in with rice (I know, I'm probably the only person who orders rice at ayce) helped cut some of the fattiness of the meats and really rounded out the meal. 

You finish off with a scoop of green tea ice cream. Overall, service was great, with waiters consistently taking our new orders for meat, refilling our waters, and changing our grills. For $30 after tax and tip, I would definitely come back in a heartbeat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you don't mind the longggg wait or the longgggg drive from Los Angeles... you have found the best Korean BBQ in Los Angeles.  I didn't think I would say that but all places are not made the same.

First the service here is OUTSTANDING.  They don't rush you.. there is no time limit.  They actually provide service and cook and cut for you.  This is not typical for all you can eat places.  They change your grill multiple times so you aren't susceptible to a burnt grill for cancer.

I would not be a fool and order anything but the premium all you can eat package (it's a little pricier at $31 per person) but the filet mignon, ribeye, scallops, and salmon are WELL WORTH IT.

Oh and the flavored soju isn't alcoholic but delicious.  Lemon and yogurt were really good.

The side dishes are okay... not my favorite.  Steamed egg was meh.. the Korean tofu jigae was below standard.

They didn't seem to have a charge for not eating all your food but I can't see you doing this when it's such high quality meat.

You will be covered in Korean bbq smells and oil (from the splatter from the grill) but it's a good covering.  :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite AYCE KBBQ ever. I loved it so much that I went here TWICE in one weekend. Yes, I did. Don't judge.

Currently, this place is listed #27 on Yelp's Top 100 restaurants list for 2016, which is much deserved. So why do I love this place so much?

Food:
The meat quality is spectacular, and there's so many options to choose from. I'm so OBSESSED with their beef belly that it's probably dangerous for my health. Dip each slice in some sesame seed oil. So good. The first time I was there, I ordered like 4 plates for myself. Their different flavored pork bellies were amazing as well. I also really liked their tongue, which is surprising, since I'm usually not a fan. Other notable items: sausage, mussels, brisket. Their bancan was decent - I liked their japchae a lot. 

Service:
Honestly, the best service I've had in a KBBQ restaurant. In fact, the best service I've ever had in a restaurant in general. In the first night, I was there with a group of friends on a busy Friday night. The waiter (Andrew) was extremely efficient, friendly, and funny. He gave us free samples of flavored soju. He was attentive to all of our needs, and always served us with a smile. He even anticipated our needs (it's like he could read our minds...) - knew when we wanted to order more food, knew when we wanted to change our grill). I'm amazed. I don't think I've ever tipped so generously in my life. 

Plus, they have the best birthday surprises here! I took my sister two days later for her birthday. They wanted to see her ID, but I told them it would kind of ruin the surprise. As long as their birthday is within that week, they will accommodate. What I love is that they'll play a Happy Birthday song, then play some random hip hop / EDM / rap song and have their entire staff dance in front of you. It's quite amusing, and I love it. They also will give everyone in your party a little icecream dessert.

Advice: The wait times range from 1-2 hours. They'll give you a device that will alert you when your table is ready. You could always go to the bar nearby, and have a few drinks as you wait. Or play some board games in the waiting area. 

On the weekends, the dinner price applies (+$20). 

Also the parking lot is limited. Just circle around or follow people that look like they're leaving. 

I love you so much Mr. BBQ. I will be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've always seen this place and never really checked it out. But I haven't had Korean BBQ for a while so decided to come here. For a week night the wait was 20 mins which isn't that bad considering the large crowds. We were able to get a large table and got the PAYCE $23.99

I recommend getting on menu:
1. Thin Sliced Prime Beef Brisket
3. Premium Beef Belly
6. Premium Marinated Choice Sirloin
10. Teriyaki Chicken
13. Finely Sliced Pork Belly
21. Master Link's Portuguese Hawaiian
25. Fresh Shrimp

What I love about Korean style food is the spread. So many varieties of small plates and colors. I knew I was at the right place when the majority of the table was covered in food and you can't fit all of it in a picture haha. I love there fresh salad, kimchi, potato salad, and relish paper. And mini soft serve ice cream at the end of the meal. Sooo yummy!

The young staff always changed the grill, refill our plates/drinks, kept everything clean and asked if we wanted more food. We never had to flag them down, yay! They sing happy birthday if it's your birthday and play the drums haha. It seemed like a marching band. Pretty fun!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This restaurant is #27 for Yelp's top 100 restaurants of 2016 in the United States.

Since the 26 restaurants before aren't Korean BBQ restaurants, that makes Mr. BBQ the #1 KBBQ place in the United States of America, beating out the Gen KBBQ branch. 

I think this restaurant earned it. The meat quality is amazing. There are many different options of meat to try. Some of my favorites are the different flavored pork belly, and the beef belly. The side dishes are good, not spectacular, but just okay. 

The thing that makes this place stand out the most is the service. I've had good service at KBBQ restaurants before, but the attention and care of the people who work here was enough to make me almost cry of joy. Also, if it's someone's birthday, they will dance and sing for you and give you and your guests free ice cream. 

The only downsides are that the parking lot can get really full. I got really lucky because there was only one spot when we went. Also, it is $20 on the weekend, regardless of time you come.

I'll be back. The 45 minute drive is worth it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food and great service!

I love the food there! They have tons of different kind of meats and other food items like cold noodles, which is suppose to help with digestion. The limitless appetizers are really good too! There's also dessert at the end. I think it's usually a scoop of ice cream. 

The servers are super nice and patient. I had a hard time cutting up the sirloin steak cause it was too thick, so the waiter helped me cut it. 

It does get kind of loud. There's always a lot of people there, so the wait is kind of long. We waited around an hour or so before we got seated. There used to be valet parking but they don't have it anymore. The parking lot is small and gets really congested. Luckily, they have seats and tables with games that you can play while waiting.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mark my words: you will smell like shit after this. I feel as if the ventilation ducts are not on or are on power saving mode. I feel bad for the workers who endure entire shifts inhaling the fumes of seared flesh and poisonous oxidation. Best of luck! 

Always call ahead for the wait time or you can find yourself standing outside staring at your phone in hanger.  

Don't take a date here unless you plan on hooking up while you both smell like shit.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yelp challenge 2016 (65/100)

Honestly I wasn't sure why a lot of people like this place. Maybe it's because it's the only kbbq place in Fullerton?? Or it's very similar to Gen. 

AYCE Dinner is $24 for the lowest one. I guess you get a lot of options. Maybe the reason why I didn't like this place was because their brisket was not that good. It was so hard and chewy.. The Bulgogi and the Premium Cut Sirloin were both good. The Premium Cut Sirloin was pretty tender. The Mr. BBQ (marinated sirloin) and the Finger Short Ribs were just average. 

The ambience looks so fun because of the music and lights. The workers also come out and dance when it's your birthday. I would've gave 4 stars but the service was not that great. The lady in the front said it could be 30-40 min wait because the rest of my party wasn't there (we were the only ones waiting). Also, we always had to flag down our server. She was watching the tv for a good 5 minutes while we were trying to get her attention. 

I may be back when I want kbbq in Fullerton. But definitely not my go to place<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here around almost 9:00 PM with my group of hungry friends. The hostess told us we are on a wait of 40-50 minutes. We waited for like 20 minutes and saw a lot of people left the restaurant.... WTH... We walked in to ask if she could seat us yet and she said 20 more minutes. Seriously!?!?!?!?! There were like 5 empty tables and she still wouldn't let us in and no one else was waiting except us :( I was kind of annoyed and after 12 more minutes went by, she let us in with another group that spoke Korean to her... that just walked in ?!?!?!

The food here is your typical ayce Korean Barbeque but slightly better than Gen. Don't get me wrong, the price reflects why too. You can either choose $23.99 or $31.99 for your meat options. The waiters here are not very responsive since we were not seated till almost 9:20 and they're closed at 10:00...they need better management !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually go to Gen bc it's closer to my house, but given the option, I'd choose Mr. BBQ over Gen any day. I just wished they turn the vacant lot next door into another parking lot bc parking is sometimes hard to find. My friends and I used to make it a tradition to come here at the end of each semester after finals to celebrate. 

Their meat selection is one of the highest quality of any KBBQ I've been to and they have a great variety of banchan. My favorite selections are the spicy pork belly, ribeye, beef brisket and the filet mignon.

The staff is friendly and always willing to help. The servers come around pretty often to replace grills, refill drinks, and ask if you want more meat.

Warning: Don't let your friends bring you here for your bday....you will be embarrassed<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This kbbq place is one of my favorites! Customer service, food quality, and restaurant quality are amazing! In particular, our waiter Patrick was seriously THE nicest and helpful person ever! He would frequently come ask us what we needed and even came over a few times to cut our meat! For the food, their meat is always really fresh and the best quality. The banchan is also really yummy and free refills are amazing! All in all, this place is definitely at the top of my list for kbbq places! I love going here whenever I'm in Fullerton!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went here on a Friday around 2pm with a group of 3 and only waited 15 minutes. I attempted to go here last time on a Friday around 6pm and the wait time was expected to be an hour plus. The hostess suggested going around 3-4pm for a little to no wait. 

Pros

Bulgogi: The best item from their AYCE lunch menu was the bulgogi. I really enjoyed the sweet and savory marinade for the beef.

Beef Belly: My first time having beef belly and it was amazing. The extremely thin and salty slices of beef belly goes on well with the rice paper and some lettuce. 

Banchan: They bring out a wide selection of side dishes that ranges from Korean stir fried noodles, stir fried fish cakes, steamed vegetables, and potato salads. They of course have your basic green salad, rice paper, pickled radish, and kimchi. 

Free Ice Cream: Without even asking, my waiter brought out a scoop of ice cream as soon as we were done our meal. The ice cream was much appreciated after the hearty meal. 

Service: The staff was really attentive in taking orders and bringing them out promptly and there was never a moment where I had to flag someone down.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best kbbq in orange county. Their prime selections of meats make the difference. They give you huge portions along with great customer service. I come here often as I work nearby. They have a bar in the back for some drinks if the line is a little long.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow, this place is the best. My old coworker raved about it and I finally got the chance to check them out in celebration of passing my smog check haha. My wife and I came with our toddler for late lunch mid-afternoon on a Friday and there were a good number of cars in the parking lot, surprisingly. We were seated after about 5-10 minutes of waiting (it wasn't super busy inside but the staff to client ratio was pretty maxed out - tons of college kids). We got seated and ordered right away. Our waitress, Kimberlee, was super nice with a smile on her face all the time. Something rare these days at KBBQ. The rest of the staff were super-friendly as well. Another waiter came by and dropped off a Honest kids drink for my son while playing peekaboo with him. Very kind and funny. The atmosphere is a little trendy with color-changing lights, loud music glaring in the background, and an embarrassing "Happy Birthday" tune they will blast upon announcing some person's birthday who made the mistake of telling them it was their birthday. 

Food was excellent - probably the widest array and most generous portions of banchan I've ever seen at KBBQ. They laid out enough dishes to circle the entire grill at our table (probably 15 -20 dishes of it... incredible). $15.99 for "PAYCE" (premium all you can eat lunch menu) was super reasonable - we started off the brisket (of course), thin sliced pork belly, and premium chuck steak. Kimberlee kept on top of refills and provided everything we needed without asking (rice paper, radishes, salad, water, grill changes, etc... most of the things you have to ask for at many other KBBQ places). I'm telling you, opening a trendy restaurant near a college campus (in this case two), offering great food and not skimping, and hiring motivated kids to work there is the way to go if you want a booming business. Other standouts (which is pretty much everything else we ordered): spicy garlic pork butt (this was just awesome - it wasn't overly saturated in marinade), thin sliced pork neck, thin sliced pork belly and cold kimchee noodle soup (super-refreshing). At the end Kimberlee brought out 3 small cups with generous single scoops of cookie dough ice cream - the only complaint I have is that I didn't get any cookie dough in my scoop... LOL. It's okay, my son had one in his, and my wife only gave him less than a small spoonful of ice cream so I was good to go :)

I can't say enough good things about this place - it's worth every penny and lives up to the hype. RUN! GET TO THE CHOPPPPAHHHHHHH!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">With places, beef brisket doesn't impress me but not here! I loved the brisket here! There was more flavor than I'm used to.

1) Recommend trying beef tongue, I know it sounds gross but it's like brisket but with a leaner, tender texture.

2) Hawaiian steak was so juicy and delicious 

After the beef tongue my group didn't want to try anything else. I'm a fan of pork cheek and beef belly so I def wanna come back to try that!

Service was good which you normally don't  expect from busy kbbq places. I was impressed by their birthday routine :) so funny and cute! Highly suggest coming here for a birthday! 

I wish price was a little lower but it does make sense given the selection ~<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This has got to be one of the best Korean BBQ experiences I have ever had. Our server was impossibly nice and happy. She was attentive and kind. Usually, the room temp in KBBQ is quite warm. They had a great AC and ventilation system. 

The food was ridiculously awesome.  We paid for the premium meats. With this, we were able to order salmon, a full rib eye steak and filet mignon. All were awesome. The meats on the regular menu were great too. If you don't want to go premium, no worries. The regular menu was just as satisfying. There were a plethora of sides that satisfied my little picky eater. 

Speaking of my picky eater...  they brought out a complimentary lunch tray with rice, veggies, and a juice box for her. 

The best part? Wait for it...ICE CREAM!  They give you ice cream at the end of the meal!

Best. Experience!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was the best quality nearby. Has been going downhill lately in terms of meat quality.
Probably the only decent place in Fullerton, but i would rather go to Star BBQ in garden grove anyday.

Their large intestine was unavailable like the last 5 times i went.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Korean BBQ on Valentine's Day and where do we end up? Mr. BBQ. 

Service was attentive and the selection was incredible. The restaurant is huge and the staff changed out the grills regularly and seemlessly.

All the meats we ordered were well flavored and because the grills were updated so often we really got the meats cooked well and quickly. The banchan were good but I've had better. 

This place is great and despite how crowded it was the wait wasn't too long and I'll likely be back if I'm ever in the area again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Monday night, one of our friends last night in OC before going back to NY and we all decided after the beach that Korean BBQ was the place to go. It all worked out since we had 3 birthdays to celebrate in our group of 11 and Mr. BBQ turns up! 

The wait wasn't very long, we actually got seated within 5 to 10 minutes around 6:30 PM on a Monday night. I'm so used to waiting an hour or two with a small group of people, so I was very impressed that 11 of us got seated so quickly.

We sat down and our server was quick to set up our table and serve us our water. We ordered 2 carafes of soju (yogurt and pineapple) and a tower of Hite beer. Those came pretty quickly as well. Whatever we ordered on one side we ordered for the other since we had 2 grills at our table and more than half of us were new to Korean BBQ (not me, Korean BBQ is a weekly meal for me!)

Our server was very sweet, attentive, and very curious about our group. When checking our IDs, he noticed we were from all over CA & 3 from out of state. He asked us questions and made sure that the newbies were well taken care of. As he served us throughout the night, he realized we had 3 birthday celebrations. When we tried to tell them about it, he already had it in order for the servers to throw it down and turn up for our birthday folks! Way to take initiative server!

The meat quality is great. You definitely get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend this to groups who are trying to be intimate and enjoy each others companies. It is very loud and with all the birthday celebrations that go on throughout your meal, it is hard to really focus on your people. However, if you're a big group like we were and all we wanted to do is have fun, drink, eat, and make fun of eachother, this is the place to be!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here around 4:30 on a Saturday night.  There were people waiting for a table already.  First they said the wait is 30-40 mins but we got seated in about 15 mins.

All the meats we ordered were very good.  I like the marinated short ribs the most. I got the soy bean paste soup this time and I enjoyed it.
The salad and the side dishes were fresh.  

Service: friendly. they checked on you frequently and offered to change out grills without asking.

Parking: could be hard to find on the weekends.
We parked at the CVS parking lot and walked over.

Go early and you should not need to wait too long on the weekends.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is really good and is a gem in the north OC KBBQ scene. The wait was ridiculously long (my party waited 2 hours). For about $25 per person, the side dishes were excellent as well as the cuts of meat. The brisket was not too fatty and the meat selection is excellent. Best of all, for that price, seafood comes with it. This is different than some of the KBBQ places I have eaten at especially in San Diego where seafood is often seen as a premium item and is on the more expensive menu. The service was really good once you get seated. The pre-service can get kind of hectic especially since it is so popular. I think the hosts/hostesses have trouble keeping track of which parties should go next especially with so many people and groups there. I felt that my party was passed up at least twice when we were told our wait time was estimated at an hour and a half. Otherwise, I would go back to this place definitely for the food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Mr BBQ! I came here for lunch awhile ago right about half an hour after the place had opened. There was already a bit of a line, but that's to guarantee good service. Though the place wasn't packed, it was still quite busy. Our server was very friendly and attentive.

I was impressed by the sides they had! The quality of the meat is outstanding as well, better than a lot of other KBBQ places I've been to! I generally don't like bulgogi, but their bulgogi was perfectly marinated and not as sweet as other places. I can't wait to go back for lunch again! I definitely left feeling full and extremely satisfied.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">THE BEST AYCE KBBQ in southern California for what you pay. i won't be comparing this to another type of kbbq.  finding this place is bit of a work, it is near CSFU... *i went there by today* and had to detour from statecollege off the 91 freeway.  

the parking is pretty generous but they do get filled up really quick. the wait here is bit long during the rush hour. there will be buttload of people waiting to eat the delicious Kbbq. 1-3hr wait. i was there for lunch and was 1st customer so no wait... 

this place has no call bell like some of the other Corean places but thats okay because they check on you pretty frequently. the staff is very friendly and they will give you what you ask in time. and as always, be nice to your servers and they will be nice to you. before cooking any meat, i took a look at the utensils (tong) and it was bit dirty... i asked for clean one 3 times... 

the food... side dishes are in small portion but we all know thats not why we are there, it is because of the meat,... yes... for some odd reason, they have really good choices of meat, anything and everything seems fresh. i had no complaints about he meat. they are simply the best and the price is excellent for what you get... the only place i would hands down come for this...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">"It is at this time that I now pronounce you husband and wife. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. BBQ!"

*then I wake up from my delicious dream*

Listed at #27 on Yelp's Top 100 Restaurants this year, my girl friends and I had to dine here for Valentine's Day. It was the BEST idea! Let me tell you why:

- $2 valet so you don't have to worry about parking
- They have seats and tables in the waiting room
- Very clean restaurant
- Friendly, fun, and attentive service
- Lots of TVs
- Great variety of meats and seafood items
- Sweetest/best shrimps I've ever had
- Ice cream dessert to end your meal

Best $25 AYCE KBBQ ever! For Valentine's Day, they even offered to take a picture of your table and print it out for you. What a sweet deal!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We came here for my nieces birthday. I had pretty high expectations since Mr BBQ is one of the top 100 restaurants on Yelp. 

They have a large selection of banchans! That's always a huge plus for me.

They have a large selection of meat. Everything was delicious! I also tried the steamed egg, tofu, and bean paste stew. The winner out of those three is the bean paste stew. It was so flavorful. The tofu soup was bland. The steamed egg was also good.

The service here was spectacular and really set them apart from the other AYCE bbq restaurants.

For my nieces birthday they flickered the lights and sang to her. She was so happy! Everyone got a free scoop of icecream. 

My family really enjoyed our meal here and we will definitely be back in the future.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Noisy but ok. We were a party of 12 but had to wait for 45 minutes because two guests had not arrived. 
We knew what to order and were starving. When we were seated, 30 minutes after the other two arrived, we had to wait another half an hour.  Mist everyone did not feel good and had to pack the food and left.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down one of the best AYCE Korean BBQ out in town.  Decided to come here for a small gathering since I've bee craving for some KBBQ for over a year. There's 2 different pricing options; one is $24.99 and another $32.99.  

The $24.99 has tons of options, but does not include filet mignon, rib eye and bone-in short rib at the $32.99 side.  If you're here, you gotta get the $32.99 to make your trip worth it.  

We got 4 filet, 1 rib eye, 2 short ribs, 4 scallops, 2 briskets, 1 beef belly, 1 pork belly, and 1 beef tough. I gotta say, the beef belly was not my favorite cause it's just too fatty.  It's basically... just fat!   All the other meat were fresh and delicious.  If you're a seafood person, you need to order the scallops.  The scallops were not those tiny ones, they were the large size ones.  

Tip: There's always a wait so be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes, but the positive side is they got games for you to play while you wait.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Move over Gen, and helllooooo Mr. BBQ! This is hands down my fav kbbq place! 

It's $16 for lunch and they have a wide selection of quality meats. My absolute favorite is the beef belly! So good; like brisket but more fatty! Meats are good, sides are good and service here is always great. Ooh and they also give you ice cream at the end of your meal! 

Must try!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I havent even left this place yet and im already writing a review!! The quality of meats was top-notch. Each order arrived quickly. Patwerk was/is the best server. Always on point with orders and recommendations. Definitely coming back here again!!

Ps: the playlist was so effing lit. Sooo lit you wanted to sing and eat<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ambiance 4/5: Pros: very modern and colorful themed Korean bbq place, bright and not very smokey; Cons: packed private parking lot shared with another restaurant, it could be a long wait to get a spot during peak hours. It's very loud inside, and birthday greetings every couple minutes, it's kind of interrupting for other customers, encountered at least six within one and half hours dining time

Service 3/5: average waiting time is about one hour, waiters and waitresses were very nice, but forgetful, misplaced orders a couple times, either gave the wrong items or wrong amount

Food 3/5: in general ok with a few highlights, the grill plate was so sticky, and food get burnt easily, they could have done a better job to brush the clean plate with some oil first
  Banchan - **** lovely small dishes, 17 kinds, most were tasty, recommend
  Chadol - *** thinly sliced prime beef brisket, chewy meat, average
  Bulgogi - ** premium marinated choice chuck, poor quality
  Woobaesal - ** premium beef belly, so so
  Wagyu Nookgansal - **** premium wagyu finger short ribs, juicy and tender, recommend
  Wagyu Hyuhmeetgui - *** premium wagyu beef tongue, average
  Saamgyupsal - *** premium cut fresh pork belly, average
  Hanchi - **** baby squid, well marinated, soft, juicy and mouthful, recommend
  Maewoon Ohjeengoh - *** spicy marinate squid, average
  Hoenghab - *** mussel, average
  Saewoo - **** fresh shrimp, recommend
  Daengjang Jeegae - * housemade bean paste stew, very salty
  Soondooboo - *** spicy housemade tofu soup, average
  Doengcheemee Gooksoo - ** cold white kimchi noodles, so so
  Gyuranjeem - *** housemade steamed egg, average
  
Price 2/5: overpriced for its quality, they have raised up the prices, expect $30 the minimum, for the same price I get better food somewhere else, or for the same quality I paid much less

Tips: Overall I would not recommend this place, not worth the waiting time at all, which has been overrated and overpriced, and lack of maintenance in public area, such as waiting zone and restrooms<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr. BBQ... is there a Mrs. BBQ? Because I'd sure love the honor if I get to eat here all the time. 

Premium AYCE is true, my dudes. Excellent quality meats, fast service and great price. For the first tier, it's $25 per person, second tier is about $30, with 6-7 more meat selections. Me, wanting to save a few bucks (*rolls eyes), went with the first tier, and it has more than enough variety for the pickiest kbbq eater. 

My go-to's:
brisket - decent, your average brisket. Cooks fast so you and your hungry friends can eat fast.
Mr. BBQ - I think this is a new one. It's marinated sirloin, tastes similar to Gen's Hawaiian steak, but, honestly, much softer. It's better... and so delicious.
Beef belly - it's sliced so thinly, it melts in your mouth if you cook it to perfection. I don't like mine crispy, like most belly-eaters.
wagyu short ribs - a little chewy for wagyu but has such good flavor. A little salt and pepper and it's ready to go. 

The wait is worth it, in my opinion. They give you a pager, so don't stray too far. Plenty of parking. Would definitely eat here again and again... and again. (They celebrate birthdays in a cute way, too, if you need any ideas!)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The best ayce kbbq place in our area! I don't know why I haven't written a review for this place sooner! My family and I have been coming here for over a year now. Our favorite cuts are the brisket and the beef belly. We can go through plates of these. I love how they bring plenty of sides, good about switching the grill and service is always on point. They always bring my two year old daughter a kids plate which is awesome because she gets down on it! If you are looking for an all around great experience with delicious food then you should try mr bbq, you won't leave disappointed!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best Korean BBQ I've been to.  Their filet mignon, prime, and scallops are to die for..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have always been a fan of kbbq and this place did not disappoint me. Came here at a weekend on a lunch, had to wait around 30min. I love how there is cards and a four in a row game on the waiting area, I did not feel the wait time because of this :).

Their meats are really of high quality(expected since price is pretty expensive). I do like how they have so much choices on their menu that everything you would want on a kbbq place would be here.

In regards to the ambiance, I felt very comfortable as the design was magnificent, well spaced and doesnt feel to crowded once you are on your seat. 

The waiters were very fast and its easy to ask for water or get the next order you wanted.

All in all, its not the best kbbq I've tasted so far but its definitely worth a comeback!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like it more than Gen.

Yea I said it, but it's true. Gen is good, but it's getting too commercialized and is spreading all over state; and I'm a big fan of smaller restaurants. Super nice staff, and meat quality is on point. 

Only con: parking sucks, and there's always a lot of people there cuz this place is just that great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My first impression was, "Awesome selection of meats and AYCE options all day."

There are many places for KBBQ on every corner nowadays, but Mr. BBQ in Fullerton is one of the best spots and only spots I go to for the best quality food and excellent service. Their menu options are extensive no matter which package you go to and during lunch or dinner. Their food is consistently good quality from the side dishes to the meat selections. My favorite choices are the fresh cut choice ribeye, beef belly, brisket, and filet mignon. The stews and banchan (side dishes) are always good and plentiful in variety. With so many places to get your KBBQ fix, this is one spot where it's a true focus on quantity without skimping on quality.

What truly makes my family, friends, coworkers, & I go back to this location is the exceptional service. The entire staff is fun, friendly, and on top of customer service.

Our group's favorite server is Won, he is outstanding and timely and takes care of us well every time we have a team outing here. He is not only professional, polite, and engages in seamless conversation as he volunteers to prepares our meats on the grill, he is a natural at exceptional customer service. He also provides his own insight on his favorite meats and how to cook t the right way! This is one of the best places to embarrass your coworkers on their birthdays! Our company employees just recently had a celebration and went to Mr. BBQ and Won made it a great experience!

The lasting impression? "There are many KBBQ places you can choose from in SoCal but Mr. BBQ is truly one of the best!"<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Eat your heart out Gen! 

This is my new SoCal AYCE KBBQ favorite. You definitely want to order the Premium AYCE menu for $29.99 (includes all classic AYCE menu items) --it's worth it. 

All the quality meats are seasoned to perfection and they have a good variety of banchan. The meat is so flavorful. When I went to Gen the next evening, their meat tasted bland compared to the meat here. What I also appreciate is their accommodating service. They are on point here--so attentive and friendly. Some servers at other KBBQ places forget to bring dishes you requested for, but here, they never forget and they continually check-in on your table, so you don't have to take the time to flag anyone down. 

My recommendations: 
+ Wagyu Hyuhmeetgui (beef tongue) 
+ Chadol (brisket) 
+ Woobaesal (beef belly) 
+ Maewoon Daeji Bulgogi (spicy garlic pork butt) 
+ Daeji Moaksal (pork neck) 
+ Anything on the premium ACYE menu! 

We will definitely be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wahhhhh I was def not impressed with this place. Gen in HB and All That BBQ in Irvine for the win!!!! Various complaints:

1. Valet parking only here ($2). Really?? It's not about the money but lame how they force you to valet!

2. Waits are long but that's expected from a popular bbq joint

3. Brisket aka the most famous cut at an ayce bbq place was DRY! Not enough marbling and just plain ol dry even though I didn't overcook it. Disappointing! 

4. Beef belly was literally ALL fat! The second round was a lot less fat but then it just tasted like the dry brisket. Blah

5. Their "wagyu finger short rib" was sooo chewy! One of their more popular items too!

6. Their birthday celebrations are super tacky and reminded me of Chuck E Cheese. The birthday music literally fills up the entire restaurant and it's pure mayhem for 3 mins. Eyeroll

7. The free vanilla ice cream sucks (that's prob why it's free?). Tastes like pure cream and sugar. Blech<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Rare 5 star review from me.  

Food quality - excellent 
Service - incredibly prompt and friendly 
Ambience - high energy, fun, matches the food quality 

Downside - long wait but worth it!

Go here and be prepared for a meat eaters journey. 

I tried the filet mignon, brisket, short ribs, chuck, squid, Hawaiian sausage, intestines, sirloin and then I nearly purged .....

Be careful and pace yourself this is a gluttons heaven!  I'll keep coming back here again and again and again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">2 hrs Friday traffic from LA + 1.5 hrs wait....just to try this place out!! And omg im so thankful i survived all those stress and got to enjoy Mr. BBQ!!! 

For all you Gen loyalists out there, i'm sorry but Mr. BBQ is the new PAYCE KBBQ King!! For $23.99, you get more than 20 choices of meat, about ten good sides plus excelent service!!! I highly recommend #6 meat which is the marinated sirloin coz it's sooo juicy and tasty!! 

Valet is available for $2 but you can always find free parking spaces close by.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr BBQ is the best AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant in OC. 

Huge banchan selection, lengthy choice of meats, consistently excellent service, poppin atmosphere, beer towers, and fair prices. For once, the endless praise on Yelp towards one restaurant makes sense. It's not hype, it's real. You need to try Mr. BBQ if you haven't already.

The only drawback is the tiny parking lot, but that's not the restaurant's fault. Just park in the nearby residential area and walk over. Beats paying valet, IMO.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My new favorite AYCE KBBQ spot! Been here twice - I'd come here more often but wait time is just too long when I'm so hungry! Ha!

This place has thee most banchans ever! They serve you pretty much everything you can think off! They have so much meat selection, my favorite has to be the beef tongue, brisket and pork belly.

The first time I came here was with my BF and his friends. We were served this special sauce that my BF and I got addicted to. I asked about it this past weekend when we went and the waiters looked at me as if I was crazy! I finally described it to the other waiter and he said it's just the three sauce mixed together with garlic and jalapeños! A must try - it's so good! 

Definitely recommend this place, if the wait is long, you can chill at the bar called "the back room"! FYI though, they open at 6PM.

**sometimes there's valet parking for $2<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've only been here once and it's by far my number 1 kbbq spot. The hype is real. They lived up to their "#27 out of 100 must eat places" reputation. 

Double dated here and had to wait almost 2hrs to get a table. It's just kbbq I thought, what can make this any better than all the other kbbq spots? Everything here makes it better than every other kbbq spot.

$23 dinner is a more than reasonable price for the variety and quality of meat you get. 

The soju sampler was perfect for 4. They even let you sample the different soju slushes before ordering, but honestly those samples were a round of drinks itself. 

Service could of not been anymore perfect. Never even had to get our servers attention. He always came to us making sure we had everything. True definition of customer service. I believe our server's name was "jt". 

If your into Gen kbbq or mo dae po (however you spell it), Mr. Bbq will change your Life. I wish they opened one in LA!

PAYCE!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A review update for Mr. BBQ is long overdue. I had mentioned in my first review that my 4.5 rating would easily become a 5 if the aforementioned issues about artificially sweet spicy sauces and overly salted marinades were addressed, and they were most certainly tended to  and fixed.

There's this study done out of Stanford that states that a customer's rating in restaurant reviews is largely dependent on how he/she feels [they were] treated. Mr. BBQ understands this phenomenon completely. This establishment shines above any other Korean BBQ experience because of their stance on superior customer service. I wish I remembered the name of our last server because he stood out as even the best of the already very good cadre of servers.

In a fairly short amount of time in existence, Mr BBQ has found its place in Yelp's Top 100 places to eat in the U.S.! That's phenomenal considering its young life. Its recognition is well deserved. It seems like they are putting a lot of hard work, heart, and fun into what they are doing. Passion always reveals itself! :-) ....and makes for an exemplary customer experience. It's always a good, light, and happy time here. Five very well-deserved stars!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First, let me just say that they DO NOT take Reservations. My group and I arrived at 6pm (everyone present), waited half an hour, and then asked about the two-grill tables that were open. There was a lobby full of smaller groups, and they told us that if any larger groups do not arrive by 8pm (which, btw, would have been 2 hours from the time we arrived), they will start seating the smaller groups at the two-grill tables. WTF. My fiancé and I loved this place because all of the servers we've had so far were always very attentive, and the food was pretty decent quality. This was our go-to place for KBBQ around the Fullerton area. The parking and wait times are not the best, but we were willing to put up with it for this place. However, this recent experience really made us despise this place. Good bye, Mr. BBQ. You just lost a regular customer, because you decided to prioritize the larger groups, that were not present over everyone else who arrived earlier and waited for longer than us. Hope it was worth it. 

BTW, if any smaller groups are looking for a KBBQ place that seats people in the order that they arrive, a place recently opened in Brea on Imperial Hwy. They have much better prices (premium meat included), and they do NOT "reserve" larger tables "in case" larger groups arrive.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I heart this place!!...enjoyed it so much that I brought my family here for dinner for 2 of 5 nights while vacationing at nearby Disneyland.  It's very hip and loud inside, but hey, it makes it all the more of a fun experience.  Each time the place was packed, even nearing last call/closing time.  Guess that serves testament to their awesomeness.  The staff was more than willing and easily accommodated my large party of 7.  Servers were on top of their game!!  Super extra bonus points with a cherry on top were earned for being extra prompt and very attentive.
The food was fresh and full of flavor.  Especially liked the extra variety (at least 10) of banchan.  Portions were not stingy, either, unlike most Korean all you can eat joints.  Will eat here again!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We came here for a birthday dinner. The wait was long but worth it. Our server was great & very attentive to our needs. We will definitely come back for more. 4<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Bold statement incoming but this will be my go-to recommendation for anyone that wants ayce kbbq which they call payce (premium ayce). Prices are fair for the quality of meat and the quality of service that you will be getting. It's the real deal. 

They offer a huge assortment of banchan, up to 10-15, which are all refillable. If you come for lunch, it's $15.99 and dinner is $23.99 or $27.99 if you want more premium cuts. I'm going to say that lunch is wayyy more worth it value. Their best cuts of meat are the prime brisket (chadol), beef belly and thin pork belly. Dinner menu, you have to get the steak and rib fingers too. 

Service is always top notch here, super friendly staff, they are always stopping by to help cook the meat, refilling banchan, rice paper, etc. If you're curious about the prize wheel behind the cashier, you get to spin it if you order $15 worth of drinks. Best value is to get a meal for 2 for free! 

Parking is always an issue here so they had to start a valet service for $2 on the weekends, very fair. Otherwise I just park across the street or just come at opening time. If you are coming during normal lunch or dinner hours, expect an hour wait or more, but it's really worth it. I've learned my lesson and just show up at 11am for lunch to get my KBBQ fix here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday around 2pm. It wasn't too crowded around that time so we got seated within 15 mins. I've been to quite a few KBBQ restaurants to say that this is one of my top picks for AYCE Korean BBQ!

I was impressed with how many sides they brought out even tho half of them were just alright tasting. There were a lot of meat options to choose from. We did half orders so we can try the different meats since it was only the two of us. From everything that we tried I'd say the ones that I loved were the marinated top choice sirloin, beef tongue, beef belly, brisket. I'd say skip the white kimchi noodles and mussels. I expected the white kimchi noodles to be something else but when it came out, I tried it and was like.....wutt daa fuuqqq lol it was weird. 

At the end of the meal they give you a scoop of ice cream! Free ice cream is always a plus!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Holy heck! This bbq joint is off the charts!! SUPER LONG WAIT!

I came here for my best friend's birthday for a group of 9 and the wait for about 1 to 1.5 hours!!! Luckily there is a bar in the back and their buzzer range works in that general area!

The meat selection is awesome! and pack of flavor. I really enjoy their awesome selection of the pork belly. 

I understand now, why it's sooo packed - their service and meat quality is really good.

If you have a birthday! request it! They sing and bring everyone green tea ice cream!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is your typical AYCE KBBQ spot but with a cool few unique things that made it a 5 star for me:

- Games in the front (cards, uno, etc) while you wait for a table
- Waiters and waitresses had LED nametags. Wtf wow
- Short rib was spectacular. Also included in the base option for AYCE.
- Soju slushy! That was yummy!
- Staff really go all out when it comes to singing happy birthday for birthday people, they even come out with a horn. It seems really embarrassing but fun.
 - and of course, solid KBBQ. Brisket kept on coming, so that made me a happy chubby carnivore.

Enjoy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had this place bookmarked forever.  I'm rarely in Fullerton so it was a rare trip to the area. Located very close to csuf.  First impression is wow there's a lot of people waiting outside and this is valet parking only?  Valet was only $1 and the parking lot is so chaotic that valet is probably a better idea for organization.  The wait was an hour and a half for two. But I was committed. Once we sat down the food came super quick. Service was on point and very attentive. 

Highlights include the black Angus steak, the brisket,  and the short rib. We slayed 4 rounds of three meat plates each round for around $40 total. Their salad is amazing. The dressing is a great way to cut through the fattiness of the meat. A good amount of banchan to take a break from the meat. 

There was about 7 different bdays that night and they really put on a show for the bday guest with led light sticks and edm. Super fun.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Korean bbq is one of my favorite places on the planet. This place takes the cake. The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing. What I like about here is that they don't make you feel bad or try to hurry you up when you order the all you can eat. The atmosphere is awesome and the prices are as well. I love the potato salad and the rice paper so much, and I always order the bulgogi and spicy pork belly. I also always prefer the yogurt soju. The little serving of ice cream after you are done is a very nice touch as well. 

I just recently introduced this place to my boyfriend from Iowa and he can't wait to come back and eat here again. Korean bbq isn't a thing in the Midwest yet unfortunately.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">shout out to the dope server Peter!!!!!!

I've had a lot of friends work here in the past and friends that have eaten here and they all told me its the best kbbq they've ever had so i had to come check it out. this place is pretty spacious and has a hip vibe to it but i can actually see what I'm eating (cough cough gen turn some lights on). parking is kind of small but there are people always leaving in and out so it should be okay.

my friend and i came at noon today (saturday) and we expected the wait to be outrageously long but surprisingly there was lots of room. i guess people weren't trying to gorge at the beginning of 2016... guess me and my friend didn't care since we got real fat from this meal :)

immediately service was on point from our waiter Peter who greeted us and made us feel real welcome. recommended us some great things to try because we weren't really sure what we wanted to start out with. and he constantly was checking up on us and getting everything we needed. in the middle of our meal i guess it got real backed up and he noticed we were waiting so he went out of his way to fetch the meat for us himself (note: servers take notes cus this is how you make me happy). made my first time at mr bbq a good one because he gets personal with you and even tho is busy still helped us out!!! someone give this man a raise!!!!!

food:
LUNCH ayce (11am-4pm M-F): $14.99 per person
DINNER ayce (every other time ^, dinner, weekends... don't be dumb like us and show up thinking you're paying lunch price on weekends): $22.99 per person

-love the side dishes here. i normally never eat the sides and save room for the meat but they have a lot of different ones from the norm and they taste fresh
-meat is delicious, fresh, and of quality. i don't just stuff my belly with just any kind of meat. i tried (brisket, beef belly, pork belly, beef tongue, short ribs) all were good. truly i only need brisket and it was fire here soo good
-they serve ice cream at the end and its like not some small ass sample... full on scoop you guys.... THANK YOU FOR NOT BEING STINGYYYY

worth it. come backing eventually when my body can handle more abuse of delicious meat!!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hate to say this but Mr. BBQ is overhyped. They have two options for unlimited, one being pricier for including the likes of filet migon, steak strips, salmon etc. Ended up trying both... wifey and I were not convinced. The steak had no flavor, the salmon was terrible and the service was disappointing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I LOVE MR. BBQ! 

There's usually a pretty long wait on the busier nights (1+ hours), but tonight I only had to wait... 0 seconds!!! After I was seated, someone immediately came to my table to give us water.  My waiter, Joe, was the best! He knew what my table wanted before we even asked. 

My all time favorites here are: brisket, beef belly, been tongue, and spicy pork butt. There are also a lot of sides that are yummy--the mashed potatoes and sweet macaronis are sooooo good. Idk what their real names are... But just lookout for them lol 

All the servers here are really nice and attentive. Whenever your grill is dirty, they are ready to switch it out. 

The quality of the meat here is one of the best!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">All I have to say is... Pork butt! Haha.

But seriously, I loved the variety of meats that they had here!  of course I was a big fan of the pork butt.  I know people rave about all the banchan that they serve here, but to me it was actually just okay.  Yes it was good, but nothing over the top in my opinion.
The variety of drinks that they have is also very nice, and they have happy hour from Monday-Thursday (I believe) from 11am-5pm?  Which our first server didn't tell us, but was lucky enough that the guy that replaced him fixed our bill and let us know about the happy hour! :)

I've only been here twice and yes the wait was long during peak hours, unless you come at around 3 or 4 when it's completely dead.  Which basically what happen my second time.  Either way, service is always good!  Which is nice, because I always feel like service is always the hard part with Korean bbq restaurants.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Get ready to wait! We tried to come here for dinner a couple weeks ago and the wait was two hours. No thanks! Yesterday we came for lunch and the wait was 45 minutes. We stuck it out, it was worth the wait, but I wouldn't wait any longer than that! When we left around 3:30 there was barely anybody waiting, next time we will come around that time!

Since it was a holiday, they were charging dinner prices all day, $23 for AYCE, not too bad. Our waiter was good, but a little spacey. He did forget to bring our drinks, so he didn't charge us for one of them, which was nice. He brought the banchan over right away and all of it was delicious. I was bummed though, because japchae is one of their banchans, but they were out of it. Oh well.

We got two plates of brisket, one bulgogi, and one beef belly. All of the meat was great, with the brisket being our favorite. Our waiter checked on us frequently and brought us more rice paper and oil when we asked. Their red chile sauce is really good, very fresh tasting. 

Only complaints would be that our waiter would mess with our grill every time he walked by, almost like he had forgotten that he just did it a few minutes ago. At one point our grill was turned down so low that our meat was barely cooking. He came by shortly and adjusted it. And the tables were pretty greasy. They had just cleaned it when we were seated, and they just wiped it down with a wet rag, so it was still wet, and greasy on top of that. 

We definitely liked it though, and we want to go again, when it't not super busy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am here visiting from Vegas. My cousin had reccommended this place for all of us to go eat. I am not so big on Korean BBQ but wow! This place was great! The food was really good and the service is the best service I have ever experienced at a Korean BBQ place. The griller was changed in a timely manner, the side dishes were being refilled, and we were always checked on. I really like it here and if I lived here I would come back, but I guess I will have to wait next year. All of the staff were very friendly. Henry was so helpful with our table and was always on top of it. :)
I really enjoyed the bulgogi and in Vegas they do not usually offer mussels for KBBQ so that was also a plus! AND complimentary ice cream! That is a winner in my book! ^-^<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great lunch deal! $14.99 for All-you-can-eat BBQ! From 11- 4 weekdays! 

Walked in at about 12 on a Tuesday and was immediately  seated in Peters area! Nice modern look, cute decor and plenty of tables! One side of the restaurant was packed! It was pretty cool we got the right side where it was still a bit on the calm side! 

We got all the sides (banchan? :D) This is the part that I don't understand, why is it just a tiny bit of potato salad or two tiny pieces of broccoli? If anybody reading this would be nice to explain why the servings are so TINY! Are they just to add on top of your little meat taco? ..I would really appreciate the clarification! These little dishes are delicious! I have to control myself and remember I want to pig out on the BBQ!

 Peter was nice to explain that we get four choices per round! This is what I loved here, there are lots of options from the basics to Squid, Ribs and Angus steak! There was also soup options! I tried the Tofu soup, I had to add chili, salt and corn to give it some flavor... Next time I'll  pass on that! We had our steak cut up for us and the grill was changed on every round! We still ended up leaving with the smoke stench! It was all worth it though!

A couple of minute flaws was that we never got our beverages! That was a good thing because I'm eliminating sodas from my daily drinks but I see where that could have been a problem. They do give you water on arrival so it's not like we were choking! Next would be napkins... we only got one each! Peter quickly got us some though when I asked him! Other than that we had a great lunch! I can't wait to go back! 

Upon receiving our check... a cute scoop of ice cream is given! Perfect end to an awesome lunch! 
Parking is plenty, maybe the weekends it could be a problem but we slid right into a spot!

FIVE STARS ... :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down... the BEST AYCE KBBQ place I have ever tried in CA, from NorCal to SoCal. I've only been here twice, but had an awesome experience both times.

Meats: bulgogi, beef belly, spicy pork, short ribs, veal intestine, garlic pork butt. I suggest trying all signature items, but these were my favorites.
I also loved the side dishes, especially the fish cakes and the radish wraps. MORE PLEASE!!!

Lots of parking.
FYI- women's restroom is on the left lol
Servers have been so accommodating both times. 5 stars for them!!!
MR. BBQ over GEN anyday, but Gen is a close second haha

Please open up a location in San Jose :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of the best KBBQ experiences I have had on a while. The food was very tasty and good quality. The service was awesome! Lots of side dishes which is always a plus. They also give you a little scoop of ice cream after the meal, perfect way to round off a meal! Would definitely recommend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OMGoodness, one of the best experiences of my life. This place was amazing! And I even tried squid  for the first time! Definitely doing this again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The premium meat quality, attentiveness of the servers, and energy that runs throughout this place is one of a kind. 

The genuine happiness on the staffs faces while singing happy birthday was a sight to see. The whole restaurant turns into a mini party with a conga line parading through the aisles. 

The wait my first time here was an hour and a half. My second visit here the wait was 30minutes even though the hostess stated 1 1/2 hours. Realistically you will be waiting a significant amount of time for  a great Korean BBQ experience.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr.BBQ is excellent place to go eat and the service is wonderful. Excellent food and Excellent customer service. Vary Clean place as well a friendly hang out place for all ages.
I enjoy going to this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Probably my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ joint so far in the OC! (Disclaimer I don't eat Korean BBQ too much though)

The meat is good quality but they also have a variety of sauces if you need more flavor. I think they offer the best variety of ban chan (the side dishes) and you can also ask for tofu soup or steamed egg. You also get free ice cream after your meal 

The wait can be long so hop over to the bar next door while you wait, the buzzers reach to the bar so you'll know when your table is ready 

NOTE: they make the entire staff sing for you on your birthday<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Gen is still better in my opinion. The quality of meat at Gen cannot be beat. 

+ Beef Belly was probably my favorite 
+ The beef tongue was a close second 
+ Their steamed egg is way better than most KBBQ. It's actually seasoned well.
+ Their beef brisket lacked flavor
+ They have a huge selection of banchan!
+ They give complimentary ice cream at the end of your meal
+ Our waiter was super nice and attentive, always changing the grills!

Valet is $1! Or you can park a couple streets down in a neighborhood for free!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">5 Stars for our first 2 servers at the beginning of our dinner, 2 for the last one. CHRIS. 

You belong at Cham Sut Gol with your poor attitude and service. 

5 stars for the quality meat, atmosphere, and experience. (Except for Chris, bro you need to smile more, wake up from your hangover, or call out sick next time you wanna bring all your bad energy to the tables)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr. BBQ, huh? Why does it have to be a Mr? Why can't it be Mrs BBQ? Are you implying women don't eat as much meat? That's racist.

(MRAs and feminists, please feel free to send me plenty of hate mail for whatever reason you see fit. I feed off your negative energy)

I'm going to be honest with you all, I enjoyed this place, but not to the extent that it should be considered the 27th best restaurant in the country (according to Yelp, which is grain of salt incarnate). The only real standout here was the service, which was excellent without even needing a bell system to call for people. We were always attended to in the best way.

What you ultimately get is a pretty good selection of meats for a higher price than you find elsewhere. Nothing was bad, but there was no high quality meat here that would blow any other KBBQ place out of the water. I suppose you might get something a bit more transcendent if you went for the super premium menu, with the filet mignon and scallops, but at over $30 per person it seems excessive.

The wait was a bit long. They do their best to accommodate with plenty of seating in the foyer and playing cards, but it doesn't change the fact it was a bit of a wait.

Oh, while I'm on the subject of the foyer...the bathrooms. I was able to figure out which was men and women because I knew the symbols (the circle and t and circle and arrow). But if you don't know those symbols have fun guessing. It doesn't specify any other way. I think that might even be a violation in regards to accessibility, since blind customers would have no way of determining (no blue triangle and circle signs to help you out). But then I'm not with code enforcement.

It's not the best thing ever (certainly not deserving of best in the country), but it's decent if you're in the area and don't mind waiting. I would by no means go out of my way to hunt it down though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The meat was so tender and seafood was so fresh! Best all u can eat Korean bbq in Orange County. Price was great and service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive.  Great Atmosphere! Will definitely come back soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't understand why kbbq places try to make it a club environment. I mean, do they want girls to come dressed in heels and fake eyelashes? Whenever I go eat kbbq, I always have my hair in a pony tail and dress in the scrubbiest clothes (mostly my husband's athletic clothes) bc I don't want my nice clothes to smell like meat. 

The food is good. Service is good. I really like how hot gaeran jjim and dong chimee gooksoo are on the menu.

But two and a half hour wait... Really?????? I ended up eating around 9:30PM- usually the time that I'm in bed! 

They do this dancing glow stick light rave thing if it's your birthday where the servers come and dance around you. It's fun to watch the first time, but they did it like six times back to back. And I got nauseated.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was good. Second time here and, unfortunately, it wasn't as great an experience as the first time. Our server rushed us to order and right when we sat down and we, pretty much, felt rushed the whole time. He kept turning up our flame causing the meat to get cooked and burnt too fast. I get that it's probably their method of moving their customers along by getting their meat cooked faster, so they can leave faster. But that's not good customer service. I like my meat cooked a certain way and that sort of demeanor defeats the purpose of this type of business that allows customers to have the opportunity to cook their food how they want it cooked. I'm all about quality and that wasn't good quality service nor food. I'm sure there's a two hour limit or whatnot but quality can still be done under two hours.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">By far the best kbbq I've ever had. The quality of the meat went above my expectations (and when they have a yelp's top 100 in front you have to come with high expectations). There was a plethora of side dishes and Patrick made sure we constantly had our favorite ones out. The food was a 10/10 but having Patrick as our server definitely made it a 20/10. I definitely recommend you ask him to show you how he makes his rib eye!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here two times first with my boyfriend for his birthday and second time on a double date with my best friend and all of us LOVED this place. There's a reason they're #27 on Yelp's top 100 for 2016 and the only Korean barbecue place to be towards the top so that means #1 KBBQ place in the nation! Amazing service both times but the second time the wait was a killer so make sure to go early in the day, especially on the weekend. Their beef bulgogi is the right amount of sweet and it's very flavorful and their beef brisket is good quality and not as fatty as most other KBBQ places in the OC. All in all there is a reason they're the #1 KBBQ place in the nation so spend your money here and not some overrated, over priced, and time limited dumps like Gen Korean BBQ House<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Checked in at 7:20 and sat at 10pm.  Original quote 1hour.  So not ok.  However the food was amazing and so was the service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Flies flies flies flies all over our food several times! Disturbing and ruined my apetite. Servers and management were professional and good customer service. Clean this place up Mr. Bbq.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tons of banchan options to accessorize your meat!
Great QUALITY selection of premium meats & seafood.
Good tasting Soju mixes.
Very attentive service.
Ice cream at the end!

This AYCE KBBQ joint is on point and worth the wait.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went to Mr. BBQ on a Saturday evening. They have their own lot that is valet--it costs $1.00. The wait for dinner was around 75-90 minutes. Because of the long wait, they suggested that we go to the Back Room for drinks and appetizers.

The wait did take around 80 minutes. If you go during a popular time, be prepared to wait. What really impressed me about Mr. BBQ was the amount of side dishes, service, and the grill. They have the largest selection of sides I have ever seen at a KBBQ/Korean restaurants. The servers were good at refilling and asking if we needed anything refilled (or any extra meat ordered). The grill was fantastic; we did not need to change it at all. The server came by one time to wipe it with a radish to get some of the excess oil, and it was ready for another grilling.

The downside is the cuts of meat. We ordered brisky, ribs, pork butt, and versions of pork belly. Sometimes we would get one piece of good pork belly and another piece of poorly cut pork belly. The slices of meat was hit or miss. I also ordered a steamed egg. I love steamed egg, but there was a weird taste to it. I couldn't put my finger on the flavor, but the steamed egg was not finished.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My friend recommended this place to us and a group of 10 went yesterday..  I heard there are long lines, but we were able to go on a Wednesday lunch time and we had no wait. 
Service was great, especially when they came around to change out the grill frequently.  Only downside was the nasty bathroom..  Food was good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always busy, for a good reason. I love this place. I never liked kbbq but now i can say that i love it, because of Mr. Bbq. 

Great service/yummy meats, after the long wait and limited parking, so its worth it in the end.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is definitely over rated. A lot of comments talk about their meat quality, seriously? Please go check with Gen bbq, they have short rib with bones just cost 19.99, and their bulgogi tastes way better than this place. Other place like all that bbq in Irvine, good quality of meat, not pricy like here. Disappointed, takes loooong time to wait, I'd rather drive to Rowland heights<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My 1st Korean bbq experience was today and can't believe in my 40 years on this planet that I've never had the pleasure.  $15.99 for lunch special all you can eat?! Sign me up! We were seated immediately. Food, service and atmo were all on point! Ice cold Stone IPA on tap and the brisket & miso pork belly were to die for. So much food I thought I was going to die. Not only was the food delicious.. but cooking the meat yourself was actually fun.  I'll be back for sure. Thank you Mr. Bbq for introducing me to Korean bbq properly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We decided to come up to Fullerton and eat KBBQ! We went on Veterans Day so the only option we had was the dinner portion. There was no wait at all since we came around the time that they opened. As we started eating, it began to get really busy so service was a bit slow. But a different server came (forgot her name) and turned it around! She was really nice and accommodating! 

My favorite meat is always brisket! It was really good here and not chewy. The pork belly was a little too chewy and had a lot of fat in it though. But the rest of the meat were delicious. At the end of the meal, you have the option to get complimentary ice cream. You have to order it from them though instead of self serve like other kbbq.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of the best KBBQ places I've been to outside of Korea town! The meat quality was outstanding, the servers were extremely attentive, and there was a vast selection of familiar and new things to try. We started off with the Angus Beef Steak, Brisket, and Bulgogi- all of which were fabulous! I could tell at first bite that these were premium cuts of meat. The steak was rich, the brisket was perfectly tender, and the Bulgogi melted in my mouth. Next we ordered a few adventurous dishes- baby squid, Ox intestine, and Veal Intestine. The intestines were flavorful, but a bit bitter, while the squid was perfectly tender and tasty! I loved that the all-you-can-eat menu included fun additions such as soondubu and cold noodles. And to top it all off my friend and I were each brought a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

What a perfect meal! Mr. BBQ knows what they're doing!  #somuchYES<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you want good quality KBBQ and service, this is a place to try!
You should expect to pay over $20 dollars though since it is one of the upscale KBBQ spots out there. Service is fast and they exchange your grill quickly too.

Meat selection is abundant. They will have your usual brisket, bulgogi, and pork belly... to more unusual items like beef tongue, squid and intestines. I recommend trying the rib finger meat, chuck steak, and pork neck if you are into trying new items. Tofu stew, steamed egg, and rice is included at no extra charge.

Ambient is a little loud in here. They usually play a popular sporting event on their TVs. There is usually a wait, especially on weekends.
Celebrate your birthday here and you'll be in for a surprise!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Started from the bottom now I'm here! Number 1 AYCE with a fresh varieties of meats, and the excellent service.. Parking wasn't hard to find on Tuesday evening. I came with my best friend, he wanted Kbbq, so I took him here. When we walked in the place was packed and there was several people in line already, when I got to the receptionist and told her party of 2, she smile and said a 15 mins wait. Not bad at all right? Must be my charms lol. When we got to our table, the waiter came right away and ask what we would like to drink and what food to start off with. I told him hite beer and number 2. bulgogi, 4. Steak and brisket of course. The drinks and food came right away, my friend was the first to say wow this is bomb.com! Yes thumps up all the way to the end. Gen ain't got nothing on this.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Finally got to try this place after avoiding it because of the long wait times. Came here around 4:30PM on a Saturday and the wait was 20 minutes! There was a huge crowd outside when we left around 7:00PM.

There's a large variety of banchan that they give out, and the salad is a lot better than most KBBQ places because of the addition of carrots and daikon in it. Service was superb and quick. A busser came to take our drink orders because the server was busy.. nice teamwork to not keep the guests waiting!

The meat quality is really good.. the steak was tender and the brisket we got had pretty nice marbling. The bulgogi marinade was delicious. The only bad thing we had was pork neck.. it was really dry. The inside is clean, well lit, and colorful.

The service really stood out to me here.. our server made sure we had meat to grill all the time, as well as making sure we had enough water and salad. There's also a fun thing the servers do to celebrate people's birthdays, however it gets annoying after a couple times and the servers don't really look too enthuastic about having to take part since they are so busy.

Overall, I'd say this is the best AYCE KBBQ in OC, although not the best in SoCal. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There are three categories of AYCE KBBQ for me: Bad, Okay/Good, and Excellent/Worth the Money. I am genuinely surprised that such a fabulous kbbq restaurant exists in Fullerton. I always thought that the best kbbq places were all in Ktown (LA) or in Garden Grove. Now they aren't the cheapest. Eating here for dinner will cost you $24 but I think it's worth every penny because you have a HUGE selection to choose from (29 items). On top of the excellent menu, the service is some of the best I've gotten at any Korean restaurant. They really do a great job of making sure your meat comes out in a timely matter and they are good with their refills on whatever you may need more of. 

I was in a rotten mood when we sat down for dinner because we literally waited an 1.15 minutes on a week night. I can't imagine how bad weekends are for this place. I'm too scared to find out. As for the quality of the meat, it is very good. The brisket was some of the best I've had in a long time and the pork belly crisped up to perfection. We even tried some of their marinated meat and while it wasn't as good, it was still quit tasty and it went along nicely with all the side dishes that came with our meal (and there were A LOT of side dishes). At the end of our meal, our server brought us some complimentary ice cream that cleaned up our palette and gave us a nice, sweet finish. It was really an enjoyable meal. 

For $24, this isn't a meal that I would frequent but for those days when I just want to stuff myself with meat, I would say that Mr. BBQ will get the job done and do it well. The only downside is that wait...but it just might be worth waiting for. 5/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Saw this place on yelp as rated really great and NOW I KNOW WHY! Love this place, we normally go to Gen but this place was featured so we had to try it.

Parking: I say it was a small little parking space. I even go the car to put our name down while my sister went to park. In the end, she got cool parking but it did take her a good couple minutes. More parking in the back though?

Wait: Not too bad of a wait, 20 mins for a Sunday afternoon after church and poppin' hours! They have this really convenient wait area with games and tables and chairs situated next to restroom. I thought it made the wait nice because we could still chill and sit down and play cards and run to the restroom before we sat down.

Service: Awesome! We had a very tentative waiter that came by a lot, checked up on us, comical, and great attitude; he definitely made my first experience there a one to remember because he was so cool and helpful. Went the extra effort and got us extra ice cream when i told him it was my sisters bday.

FOODS: Great! Great quality, yummy, great marinades, and evenly chopped for even cooking. The flame on our grill went out a few times but our waiter was so chill he caught it every time. 

Overall good experience and would go again!

Extra: When there is someone's bday, the whole crew comes out to celebrate and the music starts getting poppin' and i was into and started to join in the celebration. Too bad my sister was too shy so I didn't tell the staff it was her bday haha.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has really earned all their stars and reputation! 

Con: The wait. Double dated here and we waited for 2 1/2 hours. But that is probably because this place is amazing and a lot of people come here and take their time eating, so I guess it's not much to complain about. 

Pro: A wide variety of quality meat and seafood. The soju sampler was perfect for the 4 of us. My favorite is the lychee soju. It's so good and doesn't taste like alcohol, which can be dangerous because you can easily get drunk off it.  The service was perfect. Our waiter was always attentive, not only to our table but I also noticed he was attentive to other tables. Constantly coming back for refills and asking if we need anything else. I highly recommend this place! 

Happy Eating!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When I feel up to drive a bit further to eat good food, I always end up at Mr.BBQ. In my opinion, the quality of the meat is way better than Gen. And the lunch price is really affordable. I've never eaten here for dinner but I believe it's more expensive...maybe around $30? I came here for my friend's birthday (you have to show them your id so they know you're not lying) and they went full blast on the music and singing and playing instruments. We even got free ice cream<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Holy crap was this delicious! First timers and our server (Won) was patient and amazing at explaining how the restaurant worked ... We ordered with our eyes and couldn't finish it all lol... The server warned us to pace ourselves ... Food -1 : Us-0 

There was not a thing we didn't like right down to the dressing on the salad ... The meat had amazing flavor, the octopus was nice and spicy...

Highly recommend this place and would def come again ...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">While trying to figure out which Korean BBQ joint to eat during my visit, I found Mr BBQ and suggested to friends to try it... thankfully, it was first time for my friends as well.

- Parking - sucks; it gets busy and you will need to stay in your car until parking lot becomes available.  Thankfully, as we pulled up, a car left so I lucked out!

- Waiting - yeah... its part of the game, but waiting 90 minutes to eat is not worth it... but we waited because none of us tried here before and after waiting an hour, whats extra 30 minutes?

- Options - higher price gives you access to other meat options, which we all opted for, but personally, it's not worth the price for the extra meats.

recommend:
- beef belly(#3) &  Wagyu Nookgansal (#5)

would NOT recommend:
- Scallops - previously frozen; it has odd taste; only ordered it once.
- Yangnyum Galbi (marinated beef short ribs) - not sure if we ended up on a bad day, but their galbi has more fat then meat.
- filet Mignon - was tough to eat; same with NY Strip Steak.

If you are paying the $31.99, then its worth trying all options, but honestly speaking the $24 will be fine for you.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As good as it gets!!! If you love Korean BBQ you need to go here...now. The wait can be quite long if you go at prime dining hours but even then it wasn't horrific. We got there at around 5:50 and were quoted 45 - 60 minute wait time. I think we waited about half an hour before being seated. There is free wifi so score! 

The food was delicious, a great selection of beef to cook and the quality really did live up to their tagline of "premium Korean BBQ". Get the miso soaked pork belly, it is delicious! The Ban Chan though...woah, it was wonderful. We love ban chan and always look forward to all the different dishes but are often disappointed in the amount, quality, and diversity of the dishes. Mr. BBQ did not disappoint and they were happy to refill any of the dishes as we gobbled them up. 

The service was outstanding as well. Not a single thing to complain about, they were courteous, professional, friendly, and attentive. I only wish every restaurant I went to had the same level of service.

Now here is the part that blew me away: the service for the kids. If you are a parent of a young one read this: the kid's meal was brought out immediately upon us sitting down, was in a tray with divided compartments, they got a juice box, and it was complimentary. At the end of the meal we were all offered little cups of ice cream. The server was so kind to our child and attentive of their needs that we nearly fell over. Mr. BBQ for this alone you have a customer for life. 

Parking can be difficult but not impossible.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place. First time here and we were seated right away. I had read on yelp that they have a wait even on weekdays but we showed up at 7pm and were seated in just a few seconds. The atmosphere was modern and fun. Reminded me of a club. Literally. We were asked for what kind of meat we wanted since we did the all you can eat. We didn't realize there were soup on there and our server was nice enough to remind us.

Food was good. I wasn't a fan of the pork butt but that's just me. I like the beef tongue and brisket. The tofu soup was water down but all the sides were delicious!!!! 

If it was your birthday they would turn this obnoxious happy birthday song on and come to your table with mask and dance around you. It was funny but got really annoying the 5th time around. But hey it's different. Great food and service and I was glad I didn't have to wait<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Parking was full and tried to park next door but somebody at the liquor store told me not to. Had to park somewhere else.  Came in and there was a 45 min wait, which i was expecting.  Food quality  was what i could get at other kbbq places, but the service was by far the best.  My waitress was the best and I hope i get her when i come back. I will definitely come back, it's worth the wait<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just don't like to pay a lot for kbbq.  If I'm gonna pay more than 9.99 for kbbq, I'd rather go to Cham Sut Gol in Buena Park, but Mr. BBQ obviously has its ups. Mr. BBQ is far more expensive, which also means they have high quality meats. To be honest though, if I'm gonna eat a huge quantity of meat, quality doesn't end up mattering TOO much.  Anyway, I like that this place has a variety of seafood options though, especially if you go balls out and order from the $30+ menu. 

Parking sucks. Long wait. Service was pretty good. Their birthday celebration thing they do is kind of awkward & loud.  I wanted to give 3 stars because I don't really see myself coming here unless my friends want to go. It's just too expensive. But that's more of my preference and not the restaurant's problem so 4 stars it is haha.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place had such a variety of meats on the menu, even for the all you can eat! And the service was excellent! I'll be coming again when I'm in town!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best Korean bbq i had since gen.  Everything good except then cold noodle dongchimigooksu kinda tasted bland and the noodles sucked but the meat itself was very good.  My server was really good and he always responded in a timely matter even when it was super busy.  The meat quality was good, overall I will come back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely a solid AYCE place to go to for KBBQ. There is clearly a difference in meats when you go to different places, and Mr. BBQ does not skimp on quality. The place has huge selection of variety to choose from, even for their lunch special. I came with my sister to try the lunch AYCE deal, which is $15.99 for lunch on weekdays. Dinner is $23.99, but you can also opt for the $31.99 if you want to try particularly high-end cuts of meat.

First off, let's talk about the banchan. There is a wide variety of banchan that they offer here, much more than other AYCE places I have to say, although I think that there isn't anything too out of the ordinary--nothing too special. However, each dish is solid and I would not complain, since AYCE should focus on the meat anyway. 

Next, the meat. The cuts of meat are actually pretty decent and high quality as compared to other places. Trying the different meats, I would recommend:
- Premium Beef Belly (FOR SURE)
- Premium Marinated Pork Ribs
- Premium Marinated Choice Chuck

The rest of the meat were okay, but those were definitely ones that I found to be really great. The sauce that comes with the meat also compliments it really well--it has a sweet sort of base, which really pairs well with the savory cuts.

To top it all off, you get a complimentary bite-sized vanilla ice cream, which is pretty good. A nice creamy, yet refreshing, way to end your meal!

Overall, for the price of an AYCE place, I would definitely say it's worth checking out! Service was prompt, food was quick, prices were great!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If I die of gout by the end of this week, at least I'll die happy. 

The service here is absolutely amazing and easily puts big chain KBBQ competitors like Gen to shame. Yes, you only have a 2 hour window to take advantage of their all-you-can-eat menus, but the staff is so attentive that you'll be full before time's up. Little proactive gestures go a long way like volunteering to cut up your meat, giving extra servings of the first banchan dishes to run out, and shaking your water pitcher intermittently to see if it needs to be refilled or not. And if it's your birthday the staff will totally call you out and do the Harlem Shake (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hpEnLtqUDg) around your table. 

What's the price for such attentive service? A really long wait. You can be looking at 30 minutes to an hour if you don't get here within the first hour of opening time. It is nice that in the waiting room there are several tables with simple board games and decks of playing cards to help whittle the time away, but try to come here early. 

As for the food itself, we've tried both dinner menus. The $23 menu comes with 29 items of meat and soup while the $30 menu adds 9 "premier" items to the original menu, including filet minion, beef short ribs, and various types of steak. If it's your first time I'd advise going with the cheaper menu since there's no fathomable way you'll be able to sample the entire menu in one sitting. Big home hitters include the chadol brisket, the fingerlings, and the Mr. BBQ marinated sirloin. The $30 menu adds some variety if you've already been here before, but I wouldn't say the extra 9 dishes are significantly better than the other standard entrees--in general they're all pretty good. Save room for dessert too, as they bring everybody a free round of ice cream with the check. 

Gen please take notice! Mr. BBQ gets KBBQ right.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i can't quite comprehend how mr. bbq is able to go from 5 stars to 1 star in a little more than a year but it did... 

here is why:
steamed egg:  bland
chadol:  bland
mr. bbq:  bland 
pork belly:  bland
everything we ate:  bland

yes, everything we ate were severely underseasoned.  granted, i much prefer a low sodium diet but seriously?  everything was saltless!  i had to douse every protein in the sesame oil salt to give it flavor.  

service was also not what i remembered.  it was extremely passive.  and not to mention the "birthday" show is just beyond awkward because the employees lack enthusiasm and they're waving around glow sticks and blowing horns only because that's a job requirement.

and did i mention the temperature inside the restaurant was almost as hot as a bikram studio?  i don't know how many bottles of iced waters we drank, but because it was just that hot in the restaurant we were meat sweating down our balls and dying.

anyways, it was utterly disappointing and i am officially breaking up with mr. bbq.  won't be driving out to fullerton to see you again, long distance just isn't convenient anyways.  peace.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had dinner there on Wednesday night. Being a Wednesday, I didnt think that they would be busy...but there they go again...super busy. We had to wait about 1 hour. However, when we were seated, the waiter was great. The food was phenomenal...we had the premium all you can eat! It was well worth the money. 

Definitely will come again....also...#12 on the best restaurants in the USA!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pros: Large parking lot
Cool bar area in the back in case you want to chill. 
Trendy looking interior. Lots of space. Large overhead fans. Lots of TVs so you wont miss the game. Friendly staff. Lots of meat varieties and seafood as well. Ribeye and filet were incredibly delicious. 

Cons: Long wait if you come in the evenings and especially on a weekend. If you have a large party, you must have every in your party be present before they seat you. 18% gratuity already included on your bill. $32 ayce dinner is a bit pricey. 

The steak was delicious and since it's ayce, I kept ordering it. After my third steak, our waiter disappeared for nearly half an hour without any warning. He was extremely nice but when he was around. The other waiters and waitresses were busy with other customers so it was difficult to keep flagging them down. It took forever to get a refill on water. My Sis ordered soup and we had to remind them two additional times about it. After nearly 45 minutes they finally brought it out so we had to ask for a to-go container for it. 

Could easily be a 5star if the service improves.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My friend Jennifer praises this place as the best AYCE Korean BBQ joint.  After months of trying to go, I finally tried this place on Tuesday.

Long story short, this place lives up to the hype.

Not going to lie, the dinner prices are pricey.  I paid about $35 for just myself.  However, the quality and variety of meats you get are unmatched.  They have delicious treats such as wagyu short ribs, filet mignon, scallops, and beef tongue to name a few.  The wagyu short ribs are definitely my favorite as they are just the right amount of tender and juiciness.  

They have a decent selection of banchan (fish cake anyone?) and side dishes.  I always get the egg pot soup multiple times during the meal.  I am also an avid rice paper eater and theirs is dope AF.  Your korean bbq adventure here ends with a small scoop of ice cream, which was vanilla flavored on Tuesday.  It tasted great and complimented the heaps of korean bbq in my stomach at that point.

I highly recommend Mr. BBQ as a high quality korean BBQ joint if you're looking to show your friend that came from out of town what true korean BBQ really is.  If you are low on cash, I recommend other alternatives because this place is pricey.  

Where my wagyu fans at?!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been to Korean BBQ restaurants in the past and was always somewhat disappointed.  This time around, I could not be more happy and cannot wait to go back for another round.  

From the moment we walked in, it was crowded so we were informed the wait was going to be 45 minutes.  The waiting area had tables with decks of cards you could play to help pass the time.  Once at our seats, we ordered the premium all you can eat, which was approximately $33 per person.  Worth every single penny if not more!
The filet mignon was worth that price alone.  We didn't have a single item we ordered off of the menu that we could complain about.  Salmon, scallops, squid, steaks, you name it, all were perfect. We also got a carafe of mango/pineapple shots for only $15 and it was delicious.

In regards to the atmosphere, this place is FUN! It's noisy, busy with TV screens, music, people chattering away, smoke and sizzling food from all the grills at each table.  We were there to celebrate my birthday.  They played in da club (go shorty it's your birthday) by 50 cent on the speakers and all the wait staff came out to our table singing along and cheering me. I got yummy ice cream and candles to blow out.  I could not stop laughing!  

The waiters are awesome!!! They all pretty much work together to make sure every table is well taken care of.  The manager came by and asked how our evening and meal was at the end of our dinner and thanked us for being there as well as wishing me a happy birthday.

This was an all around wonderful experience.  We cannot wait to go back.  My husband is planning on having his annual company party at this place he loved it so much.  Thanks to everyone there for making our dining experience such a fun and scrumptious one!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here on a Thursday at 11am after a final so I can't say much about the parking situation or on how busy it usually is.
but it was easy parking and not too busy.

The side dishes were good and the servers refilled them whenever we asked.

I was content with the meat. I recommend the beef belly. They also give you hot sauce if you ask for it.

The soon tofu was whatever. But the bean stew was pretty good.

The waitress was awesome. As soon as we got there she brought extra side dishes and rice paper without us even saying anything.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The waitress is rude. I waited over an hour to be seated. After I ordered second round, she came and told me that that's the last call, and I checked my phone, it was 9:20 pm. I feel it is totally waste of money (31.99) to eat there. Do not go there<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's expensive , for dinner the price is around $24 before tax for AYCE. Maybe I'm old school but I remember ayce bbq back in the day was $15.99.

Personally, I really like this place. The wait on a Thursday night was around an hour to an hour and a half for a party of seven. They have a separate bar/lounge restaurant type area in the back where you can hang out and get drinks while waiting. Keep in mind you have to close the tab before heading back to the main restaurant.

This is a great place for birthdays, let them know it's your birthday and they will blast music, after the music is done a crowd of workers will come over signing happy birthday in the most hilarious rave like fashion- EPIC! TOTALLY COOL!

In terms of the food, I'm primarily a brisket person. The brisket was delicious,it had the right amount of fat to give it a lot of flavor. I got various other cuts of beef, all of which were really flavorful.

One of the charms of Mr BBQ is that they have good service. The best service I have gotten at AYCE. We didn't have to hunt anyone down, they just kept coming for the most part.

Putting all good things aside,the biggest cons for this establishment is that parking is a bit weird. When my party came, the whole parking lot was valet. It's $2 to valet. That's a bit odd because last time I checked this was Fullerton. If you find yourself trapped in the parking lot , just bust a U and park on the street where it's free. Don't think of it as cheap , but think of it as a nice walk to walk off all the food you just ate.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I really should've updated my review last time because I actually had a pretty horrible experience. But I had a German friend visiting and I thought I give them them another chance. The third time around coming here surely didn't disappoint. 

It was super busy but we were fortunate to have two servers helping our table out, JT and KEV. Always smiling and super chill Asian guys who were always asked us if we needed anything, suggested recommendations, cutting our meat, and they were just very conversational. 

I don't remember the server we had last time but he definitely didn't give us the experience that these two guys gave us. My German friend was like "wow, that was the best service I received in America. Why were they so nice and hospitable?" 

Long story short, they made our day despite it being super busy. The meat was excellent. And they definitely made up for the service we received before. I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends that come to visit. 

BEST BBQ PLACE IN SO CAL!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is definitely on my top of places to eat for kbbq. The meats here were of great quality and tasted all so yummy. I think my favorite was the beef belly which had a little marinate on them that made it stand out from other places. For $18 if I remember correctly for lunch, I say it is definitely worth it with the huge variety of meat choses and the delicious tofu soup.

Also can't forgot the exceptional service that we had from our server. He was always their to help us and always checked to see if we needed anything.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Looooove Mr. BBQ!

Great service, great quality, and great price.

Let me just put it out there that I LOVE KBBQ. I've been to a couple locations already and this location is by far my favorite. 

Lunch: It's about $14.99 per person and you have a wide selection of meats to choose from. I know they just recently discontinued the steamed egg during lunch time which is a bummer, but understandable. At some KBBQ restaurants the banchan options are very limited during lunch time, but at Mr. BBQ they still have a pretty big selection whether you visit during lunch or dinner. They usually have a buy one drink get one drink 50% off during lunch time Monday through Thursday. 

Dinner: For $22.99 you can have a premium selection of meats to choose from or you can pay $19.99 for just the regular dinner selection, which is still a pretty big list. Their banchan selection is typically larger during dinner time. 

Service: Always great, never had an issue. Employees here are always willing to refill you drinks, bring new meats, or even cut the meat for you.  

If there's a birthday, don't forget to let them know! They play a birthday song and dance all around the birthday guest with fun props!

And yes, they do have sections that are large enough for large parties! They also play different sport games, even CSUF games!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Would rate this place 4 stars but service here definitely knocked it up to 5 Stars!

Read some reviews on Yelp and I 'm glad I checked out this place. Went here for lunch which runs about $20 a person with drinks. I heard dinner is even better (choice-wise). Lunch was no wait around 12:30 pm during the weekday. Although, around 1:30 PM ,there were quite a few people waiting. Maybe class got out (near Fullerton colleges).

We chose the following:

1. Sirloin (Deungshim). ----  Very Tasty!
2. Teriyaki Chicken (Daak Bulgogi) --- Very Tasty!
3. Pork Belly (Saamgyupsal ---- Yuck!
4. Spicy Pork (Maewoon Bulgogi) --- Great!
5. Pork Chop ---- Ok, not a big pork chop fan
6. Mussells (Hoenghab) ----- Average
7. Baby Squid (Hanchi) ----- Average

and Yes, I got the names off my receipt! Ha. You also get a ton of little sides with your meal.

Service here is: BEYOND EXCEPTIONAL!! Our server Tim did an awesome job as well as his supporting cast. I loved the fact that they were changing out our grill consistently so we didnt get the charred taste from cooking the meats.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Move over Gen! I've found my new favorite kbbq place. The service here is great. The servers i've had every time were very attentive and friendly. Beef belly is my fav! I prefer it over brisket here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Stop what you're doing and go to Mr. BBQ! I was not into KBBQ until I tried this place. After that, I started eating KBBQ more but it certainly beats Gen or any other place I've been! 

The first time I visited, I could totally see this place was poppin. It was about an hour and a half wait. The wait time was about the same the second time I went. Definitely be prepared for the wait. If you get bored and want to kill some time, there's a nice little bar next door. Or you can just wait inside where they have a few tables and sitting areas. 

Our server, Nick was super nice and helpful to me and my friends. Really speedy service even though it was so busy. 

The quality and selection of meat was amazing! It does not compare to those other chain KBBQ places. I recommend the brisket, pork belly, and pork butt. The steamed egg is also really good!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My wife and I wanted to try something new, and wanted to get out of our area, so we decided on Mr. BBQ, and man was it an excellent choice. 

We went on a saturday afternoon-ish, and it was PACKED! a 45 minute wait, but they had playing cards, and UNO in the waiting area, so the 45 minutes flew by. :) 

The wait staff is awesome! all of them... They are attentive, and friendly, and always around.

The food, is honestly THE best Korean BBQ I've ever had. As if the All you can eat for $23.99 isn't enough, they have a premium one for $31. Take my word for it, and get that, you won't regret it. The meats that are included in there are no joke, and are of serious premium quality. 

The Filet Mignon was simply amazing, and so was every cut of meat they presented. I guess I should've yelped some pictures of some of the other meats, because when we asked for the Rib Eye, and the New York strip, we thought it would be a small portion like everything else, na-uh! a friggin' 12 oz steak! those alone could've been the whole meal. 

Personally, I would've preferred a smaller portion of those cuts, so that we can order/try other meats, but we were super stuffed. So keep that in mind, and see if you can order half a portion of those meats... 

The octopus, Alaskan Salmon, and the Scallop were the seafoods that we had, and they were all super good.

Definitely going back to try out some of other stuff we missed out on. 
Oh... and if you have any plans after wards, I would recommend you take a change of clothes, or a portable shower, because you're gonna smell like serious BBQ! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has the absolute best Korean bbq I've ever had. The atmosphere is so nice and their decor is pretty badass. Their pricing is also really good on the weekdays. The staff is always smiling and very attentive! Absolutely LOVE it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food and even better service! I was visiting some family in OC and they took me here for my last night in town and it was a great way to cap off my vacation! 

Won was our server on a Tuesday night and he handled our party of 8 (three kids, five adults) with such ease! He was smiles every time he passed by and was willing to accommodate any of our requests. 

We got a variety of meat: thick pork belly, thin pork belly, steak, brisket, and I forget which other ones.. All of them were great, though! Especially dipped in the sesame oil mixed with salt! Yum. Won also brought out kid plates that had the banchan in separate compartments on the plate. Nice touch!

We finished the meal with complimentary green tea ice cream. Can't wait to return!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There was no wait, but its a bit pricey. We went on a weekend expecting something different consider the price we had to pay for ace, but was quite disappointing. Driving there was already far, and to try this place was not worth it. The food seems ordinary and service was okay. I probably would not come back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst bbq I ever eaten . You can tell if the bbq good or not by their brisket , the most chewy brisket ever , I have to chew like a cow to swallow it . Lunch it's $15.99 selection don't even have kalbi ribs .. I came here because the review , but honestly the worst bbq I ever eaten ! I will not return here again . Btw service is slow too , I asked for a veggie plate , I had to repeat myself 3 times for me to have my order in front of me . If you work at the KBBQ place you gotta have good memory .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Prepare to wait.. and wait.. and wait.

At least they have a bar in the back where you can grab some drinks and apps to kill the time. The valet also let's you know how long the wait is going to be before he parks your car. (Valet is $1).

The quality of the food is very good for AYCE KBBQ. Some of my favorites were the pork belly, brisket, and short rib. The servers seemed so stressed out. Maybe they need a little more help. Service overall is just okay.

Overall, very good, and I'd definitely come back. The wait is so scary though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is so great and Patrick is a fantastic server! He's really patient and accomodates to your needs as well as going the extra mile. 

The meat quality here is good compared to places like college-student-low-budget Red Castle or Cham Sut Gol. And you get dessert after as well! I went during lunch hours so the price was about $16, but trust me, it's so worth the money. 

Service: Fantasic! You're lucky if you get Patrick. 
Cleanliness:  Just as great as the service
Food: Less fat on the meat! You get what you pay for. 

Would I come here again? Most definitely! My overall exoerience here for the first time was great<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is by far my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant. Unlike most other KBBQ, the meat is very high quality. For example, my girlfriend's steaks looked like something you would see at a steakhouse. The small side dishes they serve you were wonderful, too. And their back bar is a great treat. Bravo.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the kbbq ayce spot. Perfect brisket, thin slices of tongue, good pork belly and nice prime rib. 

You have two choices the regular $21.99 and deluxe meat $31.99, with the big pull being the really legit kalbi. In the end I like everything on the regular $21.99 menu a little more than the $31.99 just because those are the meat potatoes dishes. I mean if I love steak and ordered 2-3 plates of those it'd make sense to go with the expensive one, but how can you say no to brisket?

I order the peach soju slushie and it was delish as expected. Great place to bbq and beer, definitely my new favorite ayce, on the level or slightly even better than Kang hodang baekjeong quality wise. It was that good.

Service was dedicated waiters rather than the zone defense most ayce places employ, so the personal touch is nice, and the slower pace makes a comfortable dinning experience. Definitely would go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wanted to try a different kbbq place and saw that this place had a lot of 5 star reviews so decided to give it a shot. 

Went on a weekday during lunch time so there was no crowd and the meal was cheaper being $15 for the lunch special. 

Service was really good! Everyone was nice and attentive.

Banchan (side dishes) here are plentiful! They give yoy so many small dishes to start out with. The down side of this is that they didn't taste too good. For example, the kimchi and cucumbers were bland; I like kimchi to be deep red and flavorful.  This can even be seen in the tofu soup; it tasted like it was watered down or similar to the broth made from instant noodle packets.

For the meat, I don't know if it was just a bad day but the quality was lacking. Most of the meat turned out dry. There was also a BUNCH of oil splatter from the grill to the point where the surrounding surface had a layer of grease by the end of it all. Hot grease also would pop up enough to reach your arms/face. 

Really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews. Maybe it was just an off day.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So impressed! My best friend took me and my boyfriend here after months of telling us how good it is. We're from the bay area so the last few time we were in socal it was hard for us to make time on our schedule. But this past weekend we final got our chance. I can see what my friend has been raving about. So luckily we went on Sunday around 2pm so it wasn't busy at all and we were seated right away. I loved the decor of the place and was immediately excited to eat once I saw their selection for baanchan. Our table ordered brisket, beef belly, beef tounge, and intestines. I ate all the beef belly and brisket. It was so damn good. I have never been to a kbbq place where the beef belly is the same portion as the brisket. Hands down this was the best quality in meats at a kbbq I have ever had. 

As for the service, everyone was so friendly. Our server was so nice and she brought us everything out without us even asking. She constantly refilled our brisket sauce and baanchan. I'm a server too and I really really appreciated the great customer service she provided. 

I'm definitely going to be coming here everytime we do a Disney trip. It sucks cause we definitely don't have a place half as good as Mr. BBQ back in the bay. Already looking forward to our next trip down to socal!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr BBQ has got it all. 

They honestly possess top notch customer service. (Shout out to B Yi and Brian, I think those were our servers lol. They were awesome.) The servers are constantly changing our grills, cutting our meat, having convos with us, and quickly delivering our orders. I like their bright red uniforms as they are easy to spot!

Birthdays seems so festive here! They play a special birthday song on the stereo so the whole restaurant can hear it. Then the workers surround the table with horns and lights. So fun. 

Large waiting room with Jenga and other games. The lines do get pretty long so this is CLEVER af. In addition, FREE WIFI! 
 
Meat: YOU MUST TRY SHORT RIBS & TERIYAKI CHICKEN! I enjoyed my steak and maaan it was HUGE. The brisket and beef belly were a bit on the chewy side but it's probably because we didn't cook it enough. 

Sides: Potato salad, tomato-sauce like with potato, salad, fish cake, egg soup. These were my fav! Not to mention, ICE CREAM at the end :D

Parking: Very very small. Try the residential areas?

I rarely give 5 stars but this place definitely deserves it. Come here. You will not regret.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've heard a lot about this place, and had ample warning to go during "off hours" which I would highly recommend after hearing how long the line can get and leaving after my meal and seeing how long the line was. Though the wait can be long, the experience and food alone are definitely worth the possible delay. Of the dishes I ordered I would recommend getting the bulgogi and spicy chicken, which were some of the absolute best I've ever had! Besides great food and fun experience, this location has some of the nicest employees, and I really enjoy the sense of community I experienced. As a lil extra warning, the parking lot is on the smaller side.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay, I get it. The price for AYCE and PAYCE here is higher than most. But I wholeheartedly believe that you get what you pay for here. This is hands down the best AYCE I've had yet in OC. But I have only been to a handful, so that's that.

Portions of the side dishes are smaller than most, but in a way it's less wasteful. It was the most American banchan spread I've seen, but they still had standard spinach, angel hair, excellent kimchi, and japchae. Meat quality is fairly good-once again, one of the best I've had in OC. Service is excellent and although the speed of meat slowed a bit after our first hour or so, they still kept track of our multiple meat orders and were quick to change the grills.

However, their bean paste soup sucked so badly that I don't even know how to explain it. It was definitely an attempt at some fusion bean paste soup that failed pretty badly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious food. Fresh, yummy banchan and lots of it. Awesome customer service! This place was packed and almost as soon as we sat, we had a server there serving us water and banchan. Our server never skipped a beat. I wish i would have gotten his name to call the manager and commend him. 
We had a la cart food from the lunch menu which still came with banchan. Loved it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Amazing service. She remembered my wife and I from our previous visit. Wagyu beef tounge is amazing, as is   the pork jowl. Party of 10 this time and she was on point. Meat came out in seconds and no one's glass went empty. Gen is good, Mr. Bbq is great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I tried this place for the first time after trying to get in for a while. It's great! The food is good and the side dishes are very good. The wait for dinner is pretty long, but I think it's worth it overall. And the best part is the end because... Free ice cream!!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I've had my fair share of AYCE and I have not had PAYCE. It's actually just Premium All You Can Eat  (PAYCE) KBBQ. I bookmarked this place after Yelp published their recent top 100 places to eat earlier this month. Admittedly, it was out of the way, but we took a chance and decided to go check it out anyway (and we just had AYCE KBBQ a few days earlier). This place did not disappoint! I'm actually craving more right now! 

For the price this place is a real bargain. The meats are top  notch!!! Service was excellent!!! We never had to ask them to stop by... We didn't even ask for refill ban chan, they remembered what was out on our table and refilled for us. Meats are exactly as described!!! premium all the way. The friendly server gave us excellent recommendations on which meats to order from the extensive menu and our only regret was that we didn't have more people to order and try additional items. Our little bellies was only able to try 6 meats along with the steamed egg and spicy tofu soup (both included in the $23.99 PAYCE menu). I was so impressed with the $23.99 selection that I'm actually curious what meats are offered for $27.99. It seemed like the $23.99 PAYCE menu was more than sufficient and it kept us quite satisfied. They didn't even bother with offering us rice so it was a protein packed dinner with little servings of ban chan. I would have to say that these meats were the best I've had at any KBBQ joint.

At the end, they give you a small scoop of ice cream. The dinner was actually a great deal at $23.99 pp, it came out to approx $60 with tip for 2. We would prob have paid more at a traditional KBBQ joints with less than premium meats. We are def coming back. This place deserves to be on Yelp's Top 100. High fives all around!!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. 

Came here for my sisters bday lunch on a Tuesday. There was no wait and we were seated right away. Soon as we sat they started preparing the feast lol. And everyone from the host to our waitress were on it. We asked our waitress Sam what would she recommend we start with. Took her suggestion and we were happy we did. Very exceptional and prompt service from her. 

We had a great time and will definitely be returning with more family members. Thank you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love AYCE Korean BBQ, but sometimes, or rather, all the time, I just over do it. And then I regret it and never want to come back, only to be back next month. Lol.

Service here is great. They're super fast and really attentive to all your needs, especially about refilling any side dishes, cleaning off empty dishes from your table, and changing the grill.

Next time, I'm going to order half orders of all the meat dishes. We didn't realize this was possible until near the very end of our meal. That way, we can try more of the different types of meat. 

Ask for garlic..it's perfect when roasted alongside your meat.

Birthday celebrations are a little annoying with all the yelling and hoopla but I guess it's just what they do. So if you're into more of a quiet, more mature dining experience, this isn't where you want to be. But bring your kids and college kids. It'll be their favorite.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down the best KBBQ spot in SoCal. 

I have been to numbers of KBBQ places in the OC, LA, and 626 area... and this place tops all of them. I always try out other KBBQ spots and always go back to this one. MUCH BETTER THAN GEN BBQ. They always have perfect quality of meat. Their rice paper is never dry. The tofu soup is very flavorful and tasty. 

Every time I come here, every worker provides great customer service. They make sure you are always helped...from cutting your meat, maintaining the right heating level, changing your grill often, and getting you all the food you need. Minimal server attention grabbing! Not only do the workers make sure you are satisfied with your meal, they bond with you too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came on a Friday evening around 5:30pm, and it was around a 30 minute wait. We got the $23.99 dinner All You Can Eat.

This place apparently only has tables of 6, so the two of use were confused when we got to a table of 6, but the waiter said it was alright. Started off with Brisket and pork belly with steamed egg.

When we were here, there was about 4-5 people who were celebrating their birthday. The workers all gathered together and sang and dance around the birthday table. 

I liked this place and would love to come back, but probably during lunch time, because lunch is only $15.99!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr. BBQ "meats" all my needs and desires. They have so many sides to pick from and the alcoholic drinks are great, too! The flavored soju and slushes sneak up on you- so beware! The meat selection is great and the servers are ALWAYS around; either filling the sides, delivering more meat, or changing out the grill. This is by far, my favorite KKQ spot!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is now my favorite kbbq place. 

It isn't the cheapest but it is worth the price.

Lots of banh chan, meat is delicious, you need to get the lychee souju, service is great, restaurant is clean.

In the waiting room there are cards and games you can play. You will need to wait to be seated this place is popular.

Valet is $2 or you can park across the street in the residential area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am a huge fan of Korean BBQ and if I find a place I love I stick with it and Mr. BBQ is definitely a go to for now on.

I'm only giving them 4 stars because the wait time is ridiculous and the service was meh. We were originally told it would be an hour, well an hour and 45 mins later we were seated. Once we were seated, we already knew what we wanted so we ordered our meat and drinks right away, well they got out the meat quickly but I had to track someone down for our drinks. With that said, service was not the greatest and we were not checked on very often, I don't know if this is normal for them or if it was just that busy. 

I wish I could remember what meat we had, but whatever it was it was delicious, great size portions and lots of side dishes! Also, the side dishes weren't refilled unless once again we tracked someone down. 

I'll come back, maybe for lunch when it shouldn't be as busy or hectic.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Mr.  BBQ.  The best kbbq and service in orange county!!  Only thing is it can get really packed so be prepared to wait an hour.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr BBQ deserves the respect that comes along with being called "Mister." It has easily taken the throne of my top Korean BBQ spots in Orange County for the All You Can Eat category (a la carte belongs to Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong).

Before I get to the meat, one must comment on the noticeable high level of customer service here. All servers are friendly and most importantly, they do things like fill up water, switch grills, refill side dishes all without being asked. I love that they have completely removed that feeling of being an inconvenience, especially at an all you can eat place. One thing they could probably tweak is the excitement level when it is someone's birthday. When the lights dim and a crew of servers/employees come your direction, you know there is something going on. But I can't help but notice (at times chuckle) at the people in the last part of the group who are either too scared to come out of their shell or are at the "I'm over this" feeling toward their job. 

There are menu sets, cheaper and more pricey. Go for more pricey if you see certain cuts of meat (like short rib) that's not on the regular menu. On my last visit, I had no concern that I didn't get my money's worth. I was stuffed to the max.

My faves of the meal were... EVERYTHING. Loved all the different cuts of meat they have here. It seems the rib eye steak (yeah, they just bring out a slab of steak) was a crowd pleaser. Side dishes are plentiful. Oh, and did I forget they bring you out just the right size of ice cream to help you finish off your meal... wow, they got it down to a science on everything I could want in an ayce kbbq!

P.S. Valet is either $2 or $3 (recommended) and the wait on a weekend night seems to be +1 hr.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">one word describes this place: AMAZING.

- - ambience - -
honestly, where can i start with this place? walking in, it definitely reminds me of Gen or other kbbq places that can sorta look like a nightclub, with the blue lights, etc. you definitely get a strong whiff of the meat smell when you walk into the restaurant.

- - food - -
[[ beef tongue ]]
perfection. thinly cut, with just the right amount of meat per bite. the texture was perfectly chewy, just how i like my beef tongue. dip in the sauces provided for an extra taste. i had to order this multiple times because i just couldn't get enough.

[[ marinated wagyu beef finger ]]
my absolute favorite! whenever i go to a restaurant with beef finger, i know i have to order it because it's juicy and chewy and deliciously marinated. i absolutely loved this dish.

[[ spicy marinated squid ]]
if you leave this on the grill for it to have a little char on the edges, it makes it taste that much better. i loved the spice that came with it. adds a great texture to the constant meat texture that i was getting with the other dishes.

[[ large intestine ]]
again, adding different texture to the constant meat texture i was getting with the other dishes. they give you two large pieces with each order and i like cooking this rather longer on the grill.

[[ pork belly ]]
you have to leave this on the grill extra, extra long so it gets that crispy pork snap. the sauces really bring out the flavor of the pork belly. also, if you grill it longer, it gets rid of a lot of the fat, just make sure to dab off the oil before you eat it!

[[ steamed egg ]]
i don't know why i thought this tasted so good. i swear there was a different taste added to this steamed egg compared to other restaurants. i was tempted to order a second one but i knew i wouldn't be able to finish it.

[[ sides ]]
i love that they give you so much sides!! way way more than any other restaurant.

- - service - -
Andrew was our server and definitely made my experience one of a kind. he kept coming back to ask for refills on sides, grill changes, and more meat orders. honestly, he went above and beyond to make my experience excellent. i'll definitely come back, not only for the food, but for the great service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! Great portions, good quality meat, and nice atmosphere. Wish we had a Mr.BBQ in the Bay Area!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent place for Korean BBQ! Both the food and service are outstanding. There is usually a long wait on Friday and Saturday nights, but the time goes quickly with the selection of games to play while you wait. I highly recommend Mr. BBQ, as it's definitely one of the best KBBQ restaurants in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">At first I didn't like this place very much.
Their meats like chadol and rib fingers were so dry and tough. 
I only liked that they had draft beer including an ipa and stella.
I hate how most authentic kbbq places only serve korean beers.

Anyways all this changed recently when I went back a couple weeks ago.
Their chadol was so good and the best was the steaks they had as a part of their premium ayce option.
I regret not having more of both the steaks they offered. They had a filet and ribeye.
It was really really good!!

The servers are young but very helpful and quick.

Oh another thing is that it gets loud in here.
It's lively and young.
There's alot of non asians that come here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">80 minutes wait for Saturday night dinner. 
We like to take parents to explore new restaurants and now that Mr. BBQ is #27 of the top 100 places to eat in US by Yelp, we decided to go for the experience. Not the wait for 80 minutes experience. I was referring to the yummy food. Ok?!
Once you passed the looonnggggg wait, the food and the service were exceptional. Jenny was our server and she was attentive and nice. We didn't choose to have PAYCE (premium all you can eat) because our parents really eat like birds. So we opted for the BBQ combo#1. And we got to take the leftover home. BTY, they must just had a price increase. The combo for 4 people listed online was $69.99, the menu was showing $79.99. The premium online was 27.99pp, the menu was $31.99. 
The side dishes, OMG, I love the side dishes and they were generous on the refills. So delicious. You have to try them to believe me. The 4 of us was only able to finish half of the meat. We cooked the rest and took them to go. We are going to have Mr BBQ left over for the entire week. Woohoo!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Having grown up going to Korean bbq for every birthday celebration in the family, Korean BBQ is rarely on my list of places to eat. And, despite the plethora of AYCE Korean BBQ places, it is challenging to find one that is good and worth waiting 2 hours for. But I have finally find one that I actually find myself craving every once in awhile. This place not only has a few meat selections that are tasty, but they also have really attentive and energetic servers. I don't have to yell across the restaurant or ring any obnoxious door bells to try to get someone to our table. They are usually close by so you can just flag them down.

It is a little pricier than other places. I think it's around $24 for the basic dinner AYCE. They have pretty much the same items as every other AYCE place, but a few different items that I really enjoy-the beef belly and the miso pork belly . Both marinades make the meat pretty tasty. 

I think this place is worth the wait...especially because there is a bar (The Back Room) connected to it so that you can hang out and get a drink to whet your appetite.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">All i have to say is wow mr bbq! A great experience from entering the restaurant, to when we left. We went in Friday morning for the lunch special and there was no line when i got there so i decided to wait for the rest of my group in the waiting area. While i was waiting the girl at the front desk, Pauline i believe, offered me a bottle of water. Small gesture, but shows great service! When my party arrived we ordered the $16 lunch menu of which bugolgi and beef brisket were the crowd favorites. There are so many sides to choose from also. Our server Sean, was so attentive it was like he was reading our minds sometimes on what we needed. We are not from the area but we will sure be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really good quality meat. A lot of varieties. Very worth it for the price. I come here a few times and will keep coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oh man, I feel like the only person not liking Mr BBQ. I went with a group of 10- drove all the way down from LA, and was kinda looking forward to trying out this place, given the stellar reviews. We got there right when it opened so there was no wait. We all agreed to get the $23.99 option since it was lunch and we weren't feeling that gluttonous yet. The ban chan had a good variety which I liked. We asked for extra fish cake strips and was told they ran out. It's kinda crazy for them to run out of something at 1130 am!! But whatever. For meat, we got brisket which was too fatty for my taste. We order tongue which tasted chewy. Choice sirloin had a flavorful marinade and was tender. Their waygu short rib was very chewy that it was hard to eat. Overall, I wasn't impressed but I would give it benefit of the doubt since we didn't get the premium option with filet mignon and scallops. I will probably come back and try again<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've driven by this place a couple times when I went to CSUF a couple years ago...but never had the chance to try it. I've heard great things about this place so we decided to come to celebrate my cousins 18th birthday! Came during the Memorial Day Weekend so it was packed. $21 dinner! It didn't take that long for all 15 of us to be seated though.

What we got:
Banchans: they have so many! Like 14 of them! Potato salad, mushrooms, bean sprouts, a tomato quarter, broccoli, kimchi, daikon, radish paper, rice paper, japchae, cucumbers, macaroni salad, and more...I didn't enjoy their dipping sauces that much though.

Premium Marinated Choice Chuck aka Bulgogi: I liked it, but I've always liked bulgogi. It had a nice marinade on it, we ordered this like maybe 3 times?

Premium Beef Belly: first time having beef belly at a kbbq place. Thinly sliced and it cooked fast so that's all that mattered to me!

Spicy Garlic Pork Butt: I wanted to try something different and no one liked it...so I'd skip this one.

Spicy Marinated & Miso Marinated Pork Belly: these were a hit with the group. Too bad it only comes with one piece at a time. I'm not a big pork belly fan since to me it's just like bacon...but these were good. Especially liked the spicy marinated one.

Beef Brisket: the first thing we always order since it's the quickest one to cook since we were all hungry. Ordered this probably like 3 times too. Can't go wrong with brisket!

Spicy Housemade Tofu Soup: Not that spicy in my opinion and could have used more flavor because it was a little too bland.

Housemade Steamed Egg: this was even worse than the tofu soup. My BF started adding stuff to it to make it taste better...

Vanilla Ice Cream: comes at the end of the meal in these little small cups. Just ask the servers if you want more!

Service:
It was very attentive in my opinion. They were there to refill the banchans when we needed it, but sometimes it did take awhile for them to bring it back. Meat items came out in a timely manner and they asked us if we wanted more once they saw we had no more uncooked meat plates. They even sang and danced for people's birthdays! Just tell your server!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yayyyyyy I finally found a new Korean BBQ place that I am satisfied with again!! 

It's a pretty big restaurant which is great.  We didn't have to wait and we went around 3pm.  There is a waiting room in the front and they have seating and tables with games to keep you occupied and not think about how hungry are you.  The restaurant is pretty clean, sanitize, and very well decorated.        

My friends ate here a few months ago and took me here yesterday.  Let me tell you, it was worth it! 

I had a very good experience overall.  The service was great!   Our waitress and waiter were very patience, nice, and they check up on you and ask if we need anything else.  

The food was yummy.  We ordered pork belly, baby squid, pork ribs, mussel, and brisket.  There wasn't too much fat on the meat (which is awesome).  The food also came out pretty quick which is awesome!   Also, they have cute little vanilla ice cream at the end.  :)    

Will definitely be back for more!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">An Ayce Kbbq joint that changes your grill before you need to ask? What is this sorcery? 

They had $1 valet on Saturday night. The wait was indeed longggggggg!. And that is why they have The Back Room. We put our name down at around 7:30PM, and went to the Back Room for some soju. Sat at the bar and converse with some awesome bartenders. Finally at 9PM, our seats were ready. At this point, we weren't hangry but on a nice buzz and ready to drown ourselves in meat.

Great service! Our meats came out fairly quickly after each order.

High quality meat with nice marbling 

The meats were premium, better than most places I've been to in orange county. Chocalate chip icecream for dessert included.

My only cons is that it's a bit of a drive from where i live and the wait.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down the best service I've ever gotten from a Korean bbq place. Waiter was on point! Refilled everything we needed before it was empty or before we needed to ask. Came by often to see if we were ok or needed anything.

You have to get here early or you'll be waiting forever. I've definitely had better kbbq elsewhere, but the vibe and atmosphere is pretty chill...probably why it's so popular as well.

The meats were good, but the sides were very bland. It's great that they give you a bunch of them, but quality is always better than quantity in my eyes. Steamed egg was the worst steamed egg I've ever had.  I like how they give kids their own kid plate with sides and a juice box.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">All you can eat is always great, food is serve in small to average amount each time so ppl don't waste them, waiters are very patience and changed our grill regularly which is nice. Definitely return again and again when I crave for all you can eat Korean BBQ.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">In terms of AYCE KBBQ, Mr. BBQ is definitely up there in terms of service and quality. I don't think if it could ever replace gen in my heart but it is a close second. Keep in mind that since it is an AYCE, you're not going to get high quality meat. BUT, for it being AYCE, it's pretty good quality. What I love the most is how exceptional the service was; our server was changing our grill ever 5 minutes, changing our sides when they were empty, and even helping us cook our meat. Notable meats mentions: 

Bulgolgi - it was flavorful and tender; it had a nice marinade on it. I think we ordered like 5 plates 

Beef belly - it was thinner than brisket, cooked quickly, and had a nice a flavor to it.

Galbi - marinated and soft meat. We ordered the galbi numerous times ^_^ 

Pork Belly - I  didn't really prefer the pork belly just because it was extremely fatty. My friend said that it was chewy and they didn't even end up finishing it.

Steak? - I had this steak one, but honestly I forgot the name. It was soft, juicy, ... like really soft. Our server recommended it and basically cooked it for us. 

I know I said that the meat was soft, tender, and juicy in a lot of the descriptions, but how else am I suppose to describe meat? I thought for AYCE it was a great deal. 

The environment was really fun as well. The went around singing to tables; if it was your birthday, they make you stand up at your table and dance with them.

** In note of parking: the place only has valet parking... but you can park in the neighborhood right next to it or there's metered parking along the side of the streets**<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ohhhhh,Mr.BBQ.will you marry me?You are my fav AYCE Korean BBQ place now.I really enjoyed the attentive customer service and ambience of this place.They constantly changed the grill which was also nice.
Meat quality was bomb!!!!i like pork belly brisket.
End of the meal came with an ice cream,definitely will be back soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After hearing the hype, a couple of my friends invited me to go. 

Make sure you park in the front of the restaurant; I accidentally parked in the back and when I walked in, I saw the signs of no parking in the back and had to run out and move it.

The service was nice and friendly, very accommodating with our many requests. 
For your money, the meat quality is pretty good. Reflecting what you paid for. Of course there was a lot of brisket, and then thinly sliced beef belly was really bomb. 

I wouldn't say that there's anything too outstanding about this place, comparable to Gen BBQ and others around the same price range. However, compared to some lower-priced priced places, this place definitely has better meat quality. 

They also give you free ice cream at the end!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Changing my review to 5 stars because this has become my go to place when going out for KBBQ. 
The wait has never been too long for me. Service has always been on point! Some of the nicest servers here. 
The meat quality is great all around. My favorite orders are probably the brisket, steak, and wagyu ribs. The sides sometimes lack flavor, but other times they are really good. Really no complaints here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place was really REALLY good! The only downside is that it's kind of pricy (but I guess that's the trade off for really good meat). My group did AYCE for dinner and also ordered a bunch of drinks. In totally, the bill was almost $50 a piece. But anyway, onto the food and the service.

The meat was really good! I absolutely loved the short rib and the filet mignon! The filet mignon was melt-in-your-mouth good and the short rib definitely tops the list for one of the best short rib I've ever had. And I really can't forget the scallops! They're really big and our group cook seared them to perfection. When it comes to alcohol, I'm not a huge drinker, but the lychee soju is a MUST. It is soooo tasty! And then at the end of our meal, we all got little scoops of vanilla ice cream.

Our service was really great! Our server (Fung Bros*) was incredibly accommodating and joked around with us a bunch. Throughout the whole night, there were a BUNCH of birthdays and they'd announce it to the whole restaurant in song and light sticks and dance. It was incredibly amusing to watch. We had two March birthdays in our group and told our server separately (so we celebrated twice!) It was super embarrassing for our birthday girl and birthday boy, but the servers looked like they were enjoying it. The birthday people got an ice cream that looked really good!

Overall I had an awesome time with my friends, and even though our bill came out to be pretty high, I kind of regarded the price as a friendship tax because I had so much fun. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After reading the discerning Alice C's review, I figured this would be a pretty good joint for me to meet up with my kbbq-loving friend for dinner. It's not all brand spanking new like the Gen bbq joints that have been popping up but everywhere it's still pretty new and clean. We got there right around 6pm so didn't have to wait for a table, thank goodness. We got the basic AYCE dinner as we definitely didn't need the fancier (and weirder) meats. My friend eats basically just brisket, bulgogi and rice, so I had to eat all the banchan by myself, lol. Speaking of which, I was impressed by the banchan's variety and quality. The chap chae was actually really good, and I loved all the various kimchees and salads and whatnot. The meat quality was really good too, but the real star for me was the service: we didn't have to flag anyone down to get anything--they were checking in on us constantly and were very friendly, besides. My only beef (haha) with this place was the noise factor. It's a popular joint and gets packed, I get that, but on top of that it's kpop going at full volume the whole time and it just kind of wore on me (I'm old, sue me). Aside from that, it's an exceptional AYCE joint. If you get there early and don't mind loud kpop, you won't be disappointed.

STEPH JUDGEMENT: Quality and service are great but be prepared for some noise.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Our first time at this place was during Christmas break, where we stayed in Fullerton for a week with my brother.  This place was highly recommended by my brother and it was just that!  They had an amazing selection of meat and seafood to select from.  One of our favorites was a whole pork chop and a large cut of rib eye.  When I say large... I mean LARGE!  (Photos to follow) It was amazing!  

If there was anything to complain about for this place is the wait time.  But considering how good the food is here, it's no wonder why this place had an hour and ten minute wait.  We certainly were not disappointed.  I couldn't tell you if this place is not busy, but I would certainly come back hoping that it would be less busy.  

We will definitely be back at this place when we are back in town!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Gone here a couple times with my family. I'm from San Diego and this is one of the few Korean bbq places we eat at. Love the selection of meat and love the price for lunch! Staff is always friendly and gets your orders out to the table fast.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The wait is 1hr minimum, but the food is good, service is even better. They probably changed out our grill 5x. Our sauces were refilled without even asking, and meat refills came fast. Will definitely be back. Also, try the Soju Sangria... it's good and strong<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lines forming before (lunch) opening, light-up server name tags, ridiculous birthday celebrations... Mr BBQ is pretty crazy.  It's also some very very very good AYCE kbbq, traditions and tact be damned.  Our party of four had the lesser weekend option ($23.99 for two hours), which still had a decent selection of meats (including two types of intestines).  I can't comment on the banchan because I prioritized my stomach space, but the koreans present lol'ed at the inauthenticity, so I defer to them and lol too.  

Service was friendly and attentive save one slip-up toward the middle of our meal when one order lapped the previous one.  Not a big issue though, because all that matters in the end is the meat.  Speaking of which, we tried a good number of options but had quite a lot of brisket; I noticed some plates of brisket tasted almost marinaded while others didn't, but this might just be an errant observation in the chaos of AYCE.  Anyway, overall the meats ranged from okay to pretty darned good for this type of place, and that merits five stars in my opinion.

Would I want to try my luck at dinner?  Probably not, especially after reading the waiting horror stories on Yelp, but I'd come back again the next time I really want to eat this much before noon, and that happens pretty often.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When there's a 2 hour wait for a Saturday night dinner for 2, you know this place is good.

Only valet parking in their lot, which is $2, or you can park in the residential area. We chose valet cause we hangry.

FYI there is a bar in the back of the restaurant (literally THE BACK ROOM) if want to kill time - not a full bar, but decent booze and small plates. The hostess informed us of it and that's where we spent our 2 hours. After two rounds of drinks our buzzer went off, and we went to Mr BBQ. 

We were seated and one thing I immediately liked is that they give a pitcher of water automatically - don't have to wait on your server to refill it. Our server (I think his name was Luis, I was buzzed) immediately brought out the banchan along with our steamed egg (oh, and don't forget to get steamed rice!). He filled our sauce dish with chili and said he would return once we picked our meats.

We chose the beef tongue, pork belly and brisket off the $23.99 dinner menu. Beef tongue and brisket cook super fast, pork belly not so much.  While halfway done cooking, our server even offered to cut our pork belly for us. Nice touch. The other place we went just gave us the scissors.

They give you three sauces: salt and pepper mix, chili, and an oily kind of sauce. The brisket was marinated so well I didn't dip it in any of the sauces, just had it with my egg and rice. Always get the brisket!

Our second round of meat was brisket, beef tongue and shrimp. The shrimp is okay, but the fact that its unpeeled made it hard to get the meat inside. Took awhile to cook too.

Since we went next door and had small plates while we waited our tummies were up to its full capacities. They serve vanilla ice cream at the very end which was just as top notch as their meats were. We split the bill and the amount came to about $30 with tip.

 The food and the service were on point, so I think we found our new KBBQ spot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely one of the better AYCE KBBQ places, but is it worth a whopping $32 per person? Eh, maybe not.

Great quality and a wide variety of different types of meat. However, I do not recommend the scallops, which came out frozen!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">An absolute orgy of meat, at a competitive price. Beware, the wait can be very long (like an hour or more)! But once you're in the service is good, and there's a nice variety of meat plates offered. There are two plans offered for all-you-can-eat (AYCE), but I'd strongly suggest the one with premium meats for the better dining experience. Briskets, steak, pork slices, baby squids, you name it. I like the meat quality better than other AYCE places. Side dishes are better than most as well, including rice sheets, salad, boiled scramled eggs, and soy paste stew. I like that they change the grills often, and the ventilation is really great. Some KBBQ places can get really smoky, but not this place!

I think there's a two-hour limit on the AYCE option, which should be sufficient for everyone except the Joey Chestnut types. About 90 minutes of gut-busting food gorging finished me, but I'll be back for more.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here for AYCE Kbbq.  The meat here is definitely of better quality.  As I walked in, they said the wait was about 30-45, but in reality it ended up being about 15 mins!  Score!  The service was really good!  Once I put my order in of what meats I wanted, we got it to our table in less than a 5 minutes!  When we wanted to order more, we got our order quickly also.  The meats you want to definitely get are the brisket and beef tongue!  I could've ate beef tongue all day, it was so good!  I would not order the pork neck again, I thought it was the pork neck you get at Kang ho dong, but it wasn't. Sad face.  Overall a great AYCE experience for me!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Writing this updated review because Mr. BBQ has become my FAVORITE kbbq restaurant :-) The "basic" but not-so-basic menu has a large selection of meats. Recently tried the wagyu finger short ribs and it's delicious. Other than that, love the beef tongue, sirloin, and of course, brisket!! During my last visit, we had Joseph (I think) as our server and he was the best server I've ever had. He was very quick and attentive and refilled our sides/sauces without us even having to ask. Will be returning soon because I'm craving already.

* Parking is a struggle and the wait is veeery long (even on Monday nights) but it's worth it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As a korean bbq enthusiast, I have been to many places regarded as 5 star kbbq places(Cham soot, gen, moodaepo). Mr bbq is up there. Their service is one of the best as they are very friendly and prompt. You know a good kbbq place once their brisket is a1. Here it was very good along with the rest of their meat choices 

However the downside is that their prices for dinner sky rocket which is a big increase from their reasonable lunch price 

Overall great place and worth to keep going as your go to kbbq place<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has the best kbbq! All the meats are fresh and marinated really nicely. The brisket, bulgogi, squid, & mussel were the best in my opinion. The price is very reasonable, most kbbq places are much more expensive and don't taste as good. The staff was really nice and changed our grills very often. when we ordered, the food came out super quickly. Nothing negative to say about this place. I wasn't expecting to like this place since I don't really like kbbq but I would definitely come back here when I'm craving :-)!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr. BBQ is one of the best Korean BBQ spots in the area. If you're tired of your normal spots like Cham Soot Gol, Star BBQ, etc, then hit up this spot. Meat selections are good and the quality is A1. The salad and sides are also very good. 

Unlike other spots, Mr. BBQ's staff offer great service and are attentive. They have a lot of people on deck.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not a bad Korean BBQ option. I have never had Korean BBQ outside of KTown and this place was pretty comparable but pricey. I could get options just as good and if not better at KTown at a cheaper price. On weekdays, however, their lunch price is a bargain!

I came here on a weekday with a few friends. We were seated almost immediately after our party arrived and it got pretty packed thereafter. I have the table setup. It was 7 of us so we needed 2 grills but they 2 grills were so far apart if felt as if we were two different parties/tables. They have two options - regular and premium. Premium is like $8 more but you get to get Beef Tongue, Filet Mignon, Ribeye and other options. The meat in general was average. I tried to eat as many Fliet and Ribeye as I could to get my moneys worth. What was pretty disappointing was the Beef Tongue. Everything else - Brisket, Pork Belly, Galbi, Bulgogi -  was average. Service is a bit slow and they might miss whatever you order sometimes. The plus side is ample parking + free ice cream in the end.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very friendly staff. They regularly check up on you to see if everything is okay or you need something. And they will keep an eye on your grill for you and have a fresh grill to change out without you having to ask. Side dishes were plentiful and the quality of the meat was on point. My friends and I ended up probably ordering a total of 10 plates of beef belly and some other stuff. Definitely coming back here if I am in the area again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The service here is spectacular !! The food was great! Our service was over and beyond excellent ! 
I'd recommend the beef tongue!

Our server was Awesome! She always came to our needs.
We came in a group of 15 and we all just didn't like how our table only had 2 grills... 

But overall experience was cool 

4 1/2 stars for only 2 grills :(
We always had to Over fill the grills! With cooked and uncooked meat since there was so many of us :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">In all honesty I would have never expected such spectacular food and service from a Korean BBQ place. We came around midday around 4 on a Saturday and it was surprisingly slow and we didn't have to wait. The ambiance was so lively and they had sports playing which was such a great plus

Our server Patrick was a self proclaimed meat expert, I've never been able to say "oh well I kinda like this" and have him immediately start recommending other menu items that are similar. There wasn't a single one of his recommendations that my party and I disliked. He suggested the pork cheek and beef tongue and even brought out a tray of lemons, jalapeños and garlic from the back for us! This goes above and beyond any expectations I've ever had for this place and he singlehandedly is the reason why I'm coming back to this place and asking for him specifically every time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place provides wonderful service. We came here at around 5:15 pm on a Saturday and the wait was 45 minutes. It is kind of weird that we had to do valet parking though if we parked in their lot. The food was decent. I felt that some of their marinated meats were too sweet though. The bulgogi we ordered tasted super sugared. I liked their brisket, short ribs and my boyfriend also liked the shrimp. I did not enjoy their baby squid or pork belly. Pork belly had too much fat. Ox intestines were alright, but I disliked the veal intestine. They provide about 20 side dishes! Anyways, decent place for kbbq. The ladies at the front and our waiter were super nice and cute<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Jesus Fucken Christ!! 
Stay away Friday-Sunday
Jammed pack! College Crowd
(Will NOT FIND PARKING)
Had to wait 40 minutes for someone to leave.. Yeah you can try parking across the street but you risk getting your car towed'
So be extra aware of the street signs and the local businesses'
All that trouble and the Food 
wasn't even that good'
my stomach hurts just thinking of it.
place is over hyped..
Costumer service was the only thing that was Excellent   
Won't find service like this at Disneyland haha..  
saw two bus boys clean up a table of 12 in matter of seconds..   
Disneyland employees will just stare at it for a while and determine when to clean it.. 
It's ok I work at Disney I can talk shit lol.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here with some good friends on Thurs. since we decided to try a new place. 
My all time favorites for Korean BBQ is always the bulgogi... It is thinly sliced marinated meat that melts in your mouth.
The second favorite was the spicy chicken and then the runner-up was a teriyaki chicken.
It is definitely a cool place to go celebrate one's birthday with a large group.
On a side note,  expect to valet park your car because even though they have a large parking lot you have to pay regardless if you park or they park it for you ....their reason is that it's a "private lot". The logic behind that response didn't make sense at all since it's a restaurant with a parking lot  not a parking lot for event parking.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best all you can eat Korean barbecue in America. Got to have #5 and 6. Very good service. My 3 year old was with me and the proactive and got a child's plate for her (for free).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The service at this KBBQ place is the best I've had.  Normally at a KBBQ joint it's hard to flag someone down but at Mr. BBQ, they go above and beyond to continuously be available and check on you.  

It will be a little more expensive than what I'm used to, but with the high price comes high quality meat and a good environment.  You can order beer towers and soju, and the banchan is amazing.  You get around 10 banchan dishes to accompany your meats.  This is also the most side dishes I've ever had at KBBQ. 

The place is always busy, the parking lot is small and at some points they valet when it gets crowded.  There are long waits normally but we've come early to beat the dinner crowd.  

It's in Fullerton so it's far for me, but well worth the good times we've shared here.  Really great KBBQ food and drink and service all around.  They do a great job.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for dinner, just me and one other person. Place was busy but their service was still quick and attentive. We got the AYCE and everything was great quality and the sheer amount of sides was worth it. 

My only complaint is they don't clean their shrimp of the vein which is kinda gross but seems to be standard at KBBQ spots.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After my cousin introduced me to KBBQ at Koreana, she promised to take me to a sit-down place that she swore would blow me away. One Saturday afternoon, we made the drive to Fullerton for Mr. BBQ. As soon as we walked in, I knew we were in for a treat. Unlike Koreana, you get to sit down and have everything brought to you.

The service was insanely friendly. They were very attentive even on a busy Saturday. They seem to have dedicated people to monitor banchan, your grill cover, your drinks, etc. I noticed their grill covers are higher quality than the ones at Koreana, as stuff wasn't instantly stuck onto them. 

They also had a huge variety of meat. We had the Portuguese Hawaiian sausage, brisket, bulgogi and teriyaki chicken Everything we tried was incredible. Next time, I definitely want to get a tower of beer. If it's your birthday, prepare for ridiculousness. They play the birthday song at full volume and dance around with glow sticks. It looked like fun. Definitely give this place a try. It's very high quality and the service is amazing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for the first time yesterday and omg, BEST. KBBQ. EVER. The meat was really good. The grill was great! We didn't even have to change the grill but our server, Kevin, changed it once cause I was telling my table that the grill is really good & the server overheard & said he would change it haha. Oh & speaking of server, the service there was great! Kevin was my server for the night & m he was very attentive & always brought out everything we wants really fast. 

Whenever we ordered more meats or extra sides, it was brought out fast. Never had to wait a long time. 

Oh & there is so many banchans!! 

I will definitely be coming to this place a lot more now. Mmmmmm I love kbbq.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So this is the one right off of State College and Chapman which replaced the old Jinga. This place takes Gen as its main competitor and really tries to blow it out of the water. The service at this place is unparallel to any other kbbq place I have ever been. There is plenty of staff waiting hand and foot on customers. I never had to wait for a server to come by to attend to our needs during our dinner. Fabulous. I was thoroughly impressed at the aptitude of any of the employees to quickly identify an empty dish and know which banchan belonged. Kudos. Just kudos.

For $20.99USD dinner price, we were able to get the PAYCE (premium all you can eat) which included quite an array of different meats, usually the most popular, with additional options of squid, soondobu, and steamed egg (gyeran jjim or ). Delicious. Topped the meal off at the end with vanilla ice cream.

Other pluses: big bathrooms, draft beers that were more than domestic or Asian, attentive service. Minuses... Just the grill was a bit strange, it was probably the newest thing, but I felt like the cooking process was lost on some of the flavor because it all just dripped away without letting it cook with like on the traditional style pans. I mean overall this place really can't be beat even though the wait was about an hour on a Sunday night. I will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came back for lunch (only $15!) and once again is extremely satisfied! No wait at all. The meat quality was still consistent. My favorite is the beef belly :) 

Thank you Brian or Breezy for your excellent service! He always refilled our sides, asked how we're doing, cooked our meat, smiled, and was polite. This guy deserves a raise! haha. Overall, everything was great and I will definitely come back ~<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Eating KBBQ is always an uplifting experience. If you're a KBBQ aficionado taking your less than experienced date here, you will look like Neil de Grasse Tyson with your ordering prowess and extensive knowledge of banchan choices. There are three main factors to consider when choosing the meat itself: the type of meat, the cut, and marinade (or in most cases, lack of). I am a beef kind of girl; always have, always will be. Therefore, my absolute go to would be the beef belly. In regards to cut, the thinner a slice of meat is, the crispier the meat will become. It's really all a matter of preference. By your first few experiences, you can somewhat gauge what type of KBBQ person you are.

Mr. BBQ fulfills all the KBBQ staples. The choices vary, ranging from the basic brisket to the more "exotic" pig cheek. The meat is marbled beautifully and the portions aren't half bad. As for banchan, here is their selection:

-Chapchae
-Corn
-Potato salad
-Kimchi
-Kimchi flavored potato
-String beans
-Broccoli
-Radish paper (not really banchan)

So kick back, drink a couple shots of soju and enjoy the welcoming atmosphere that Mr.BBQ strives to maintain.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time here and I can definitely say it's one of our top 5 kbbq places! Great meat quality, TONS of sides, and very attentive staff!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Amazing KBBQ! But I will definitely be saving this place for special occasions since it's definitely on the pricier side. I literally came here because they have filet mignon which is my favorite cut of meat. It was so delicious! The filets were just seasoned with salt and pepper which perfect. They took long to cook, but the wait was well worth it. The cuts were super tender, like melt in your mouth amazing! We also had our regulars of beef belly and brisket which were amazing as well. The atmosphere was very lively, and loud which I prefer. The service was impeccable, which says A LOT for KBBQ's, and they had many side dishes (which I usually will sample but don't prefer to eat). I do wish they would ask if you want them because I feel like it is such a waste ): The wait was pretty long, but hey you can't get everything you want in life. I will definitely return here when I can justify spending the cash.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">AYCE Korean BBQ in Fullerton. It's located just down the street from CSUF, and as you can imagine, it's busy almost all the time.  We often drive by and see millions of people waiting outside.  I don't blame them, this place is delish!  

This restaurant is a little bit pricier than most of the K-town AYCE KBBQ places with the lowest tier of their dinner menu being priced at $22.99.  They have a lot of great options though, which include beef tongue, wagyu short rib finger meat, Polynesian sausage, beef belly, several types of pork belly, whole steaks, squid, shrimp, brisket (and I could seriously go on).  I really enjoyed the quality of the meat at this KBBQ location.  It's good, and the meat is better than other places, but I guess you really do get what you pay for.  

Beware though, it's quite crowded here and the wait time varies from 30 mins to 2 hours, especially at peak times.  Sometimes, you'll also see empty tables, but that's probably just because they want to make sure the staff has enough time to provide stellar service to their guests.  The meat comes our fairly quickly once you order it, and your side dishes are always refilled.  My only small issue is that they don't have a soda fountain, soda comes out in cans.  At the end of your meal, they will give you each a scoop of ice cream (flavors vary).  

The inside of the restaurant has a nice modern ambiance.  The tables are spread out, which is great.  It's always nice when you don't feel like you're sitting on top of the people behind you.  The restaurant also doesn't get too smokey from people burning or overcooking their meat.  I think there's good ventilation.  But, like 99% of KBBQ places, be prepared to leave smelling like meat for the next 3 days.  

The only thing that deters us from coming here for often is the fact that it's always busy.  The meat is good, the staff is friendly, and even the side dishes are yummy.  If you don't want to wait, I'd recommend coming at off hours.  I drove straight there after work on Thursday and lucked out by not having to wait, however about 30 mins later, there were a ton of people waiting to be seated.  

Overall, I'd recommend this place, especially if you're in the North OC area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Locally this is the best KBBQ.  I really thought Gen was top notch but this place completely blew it out the water not to mention they got ice cream too.  That's a wrap...wrap it up!!

I came through really really early right when they first open at 11am and was seated almost immediately.  Parking can be pretty bad but since I was early, it wasn't too bad.  Eventually I did see a line forming so I gotta pat myself on the back for waking up early lol.  Once inside I notice the waiting area which has plenty of tables and games for your enjoyment while you patiently await.  I believe you can order drinks too (non alcoholic).  The meat here is top quality.  I came through on the weekend so there wasn't the usual lunch deal of 14.99 which was ok since I really came here for that 20.99 ayce deal anyways.  It comes with more than enough options for you to dive into and each are as good as the next.  

Our first order were the brisket, the marinated chicken, and the pork belly.  The brisket was super juicy and has very limited fat which means this place rules!!!  The marinated chicken was my least favorite but it was absolutely delicious still.  The pork belly was one of the best pork belly I have ever had in my life.  I had Eight a couple of days ago (which specializes in pork belly and even that didn't taste as good as this).  For the second go round we picked up more brisket and some sausages.  The sausage I didn't really care too much about but my brother stated that it was one of the better ones he's tried.  Third round we ordered more brisket (yeah they are that good) and the hawaiian steak.  By now I'm getting kinda full so I finished up the brisket (delish) and had a piece of the steak.  It definitely rivals Gen hawaiian steak.  

Service here is awesome.  I'll admit it was slow and decent at first but as the time past by the server got a lot better and better.  The place is clean.  The ambiance caters towards a younger crowd and there was espn playing on the tv screens.   There are a lot of side dishes and I mean a lot!!  The sauces are really good too (sauce is a big deal for me).  The rice was also zesty.  And lastly the tofu soup was incredibley flavorful.  It had just the right amount of spice.  

My overall score for Mr. BBQ= 7 THUMBS UP!!

PS no preset grading scale

PPS I might come back for the homie b-day I heard they do something special on b-days (hope they take reservations cause wait can be 2 hrs I heard)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was really happy with the service and food here. especially the service. They consistently came and changed the grill and even cut up some of my meat which I've never seen them do anywhere. maybe I'm a kbbq noob but I was really happy good ayce<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Visited Mr BBQ with my little sister and boyfriend for the first time ever, and was pleasantly blown away!

The wait time (incredibly long) was standard, parking was easy to find (as is typical of Orange County), and the food was pretty good (on the same level as other KBBQ places). 

But what really blew me away was the service! My server Peter, although very busy, was incredibly attentive and made sure we understood exactly what each item on the menu was! We never had to wait long for a refill, and when we were uncertain about what to order, Peter submitted orders based on our general preferences. We were treated like royalty thanks to his respectful attitude, speed, and awesome sense of humor. 

Three stars for Mr. BBQ, 5 stars for Peter our server. 

(Last note: the weekend AYCE price is the dinner price: $20. Lunch: $15)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pretty good meat selection and lots of banchan. They even provide you with a bowl of sesame oil and salt and pepper if you really want to season up your food as you cook it. (ask for it) Besides the usual kbbq experience of order the meats, cook the meats, eat the meats, and repeat... Lol I want to say the service was magical. And by magical I mean that I never freaking saw the bowl of salad leave the table! It was empty, I was distracted, and then bam! It's full again!

+Note+ Parking kinda sucked and was hard to find at 8pm on a Tuesday. You can park across the street in the neighborhood area if anything though. There's also a CVS plaza further down if desperate lol<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">#1 KBBQ

hands down- THE BEST!!!

Price/ don't be scared- just do it. You'll come back many times for the high quality of meAt you will be engulfing. 

Service/ your server will give you all the attention ^_~

FOOD/ my mouth is drooling right now, and it's 7 AM as I write this review. I love there brisket and side dishes. 


I always come back haha can't go anywhere else but here. 

" I live to eat "<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thank you Robert, our server for being the best! Made our first time experience an unforgettable moment! There are so many options here at Mr BBQ and an affordable price too! Lunch for $15.99, Dinner $23.99 all you can eat! 

My favorite is the Bulgogi and the Pork Bellies!

The workers here are very nice and I highly recommend this area! Great place to eat Korean BBQ. Night time will be super busy, so come early and prepare to wait. 11AM-3PM best time to come!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I come many time Mr. BBQ. Dis place very good. Price little expensive $23 dolhairs but my mother say to me when I young baby: don't be da so cheap SOOOO CHEAP liek your father!!

Boy server his name Juntae. Very handsuuuuuuuum boy. I know he work what time what day I look at him thru window. He no look at me pretend I ghost. Why he do that? It hut my feeelings bery much. I give good tip duh evertim to him because he very good server. I think mr. bbq very busy that's why. I come bak next time maybe he smile to me. He look duh so angry all the time. Smile more bic boiiii ok??

On the real though, food is delish. On the scale of dankosity (1 being the oregano you bought some dude when you were in 10th grade and 10 being the top shelf wiz khalifa) THIS IS THE MOON ROCKs of KOREAN BBQ. Ok so if you don't know better, you got your low shelf $10s kbbq which you might as well throw your money into the fire they provide for you. Then you got your $15-$20 Gen which is ehhh hit or miss and quality could always be better. 

Lastly, you got Mr. BBQ PRIVATE RESERVE moonrocks. Everyone knows that quality beats quantity every single time. Well, you're in luck buddy boy. Here you get QUALITY AND QUANTITY. If there was spot in your body called the K-spot, Mr. BBQ would hit it every time. This stuff right here is the dankest stuff you will ever find in Socal bruh. This right here is your White Castle. Food and service are A1 top notch.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here on a Thursday night at 8pm for a party of 10 to celebrate a friend's birthday. Good thing I came early to put down my name because it took almost an hour to get seated. While you waited, there's a huge room and patio to sit around which is nice. I even saw a game of Connect 4 to play with and pass time. My friends and I ordered a pitcher and bottle of sake to drink and kill time. 

As soon as we were seated, we had a bunch of banchans set up for us. They were quick to take our orders. I can't remember what we ordered, but everything was such high quality and incredibly yummy. When they came around for our third round saying that it's the last time we could order food because they were closing soon, we were too ambitious and over-ordered. We were stuffing ourselves like turkeys on thanksgiving, but there was no way we could finish all of the food. The waiter saw our struggle and told us that we didn't have to finish it. I have to say that their understanding made me love them more. I had such amazing service here with how accommodating they were about everything we asked for. On top of that, the meats itself is top-notch. 

For your birthday, they have the waiters come around with lights and music and dancing. It's all types of fun. And to end, we got a scoop of ice cream too. For $20.99 per person along with alcohol, it came out to around $30 for me. This place is worth your price and definitely the best KBBQ in my book.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I LOVE this place!!! It's a bit loud, but makes for a great place for hungry people to come together and celebrate!

On a Saturday night, expect to wait 1-2 hours, but it's worth the wait! While waiting you can go to their bar in the back, The Back Room. Valet parking is the only way to park and only $1!

The girls at the counter were nice and welcoming. They give you a buzzer and tell you the approximate wait time. They're pretty accurate. We were told 1.5-2 hours and we waited 1.5 hours. 

The restaurant is very clean and spacious. I like the fact that your chair isn't against someone else's. The restrooms are also very clean. 

Our waiter was ANDREW, he was great!! Very attentive and patient with our neediness. I was amazed at how he remembered everything we order without having to write it down. We were also helped by STEVEN he was also nice. 

The meat quality is perfect! I love how Mr. BBQ serves whole pieces of fresh meat, it just shows you you're getting your money's worth. I highly recommend the "all included" menu for only $29.99. It's well worth it! The scallops were frozen, but cooked very well on the grill along with the baby octopus. We all got to enjoy the filet mignon, beef chuck steak, brisket, marinated short rib, shrimp, and pork belly. All of their sides and salad were great too!

Our party also enjoyed the birthday celebration they have. The whole crew of waiters come up to your table with light-up glasses and glow sticks to sing happy birthday and then play a fun party song, followed by ice cream!!! Mmmm.... Good vanilla ice cream.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is really expensive but it is extremely addictive and delicious.  The service is pretty quick and you get green tea ice cream after your meal.  The meat quality is really good and you will probaly find yourself ordering until you feel pregnant and have to hide leftover meat that you cant finish.  The beef belly and porkbelly are delicious here, and i definetly recommend the beef brisket!  It is a must for kbbq and it is delicious here.  Make sure to ask for sesame oil!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have dined with friends and family before at other KBBQ establishments, and even in other states. This is by far, the absolute best experience I've had, in ANY Korean BBQ restaurant. As you open the door to the entrance, you get an amazing redolence of Korean BBQ. As you walk through the foyer and approach the host stand, you are instantly greeted by two beautiful lovely young ladies who were more than happy to get you on the wait list. As my buddy and I were waiting to be seated, we were entertained by a deck of playing cards and had views of tv's in every angle to watch the game, as well as the hip mixture of music being played over the speakers. We got sat in about 20 min. Apparently we got to Mr. BBQ at great timing because mid way through our meal, the foyer was filled with patrons waiting to be sat. Our food came out in great timing with ample amounts of meat on each plate including the slew of side dishes, which were "ON POINT". As my buddy and I were catching up on life, and enjoying our early dinner, we were startled by the birthday song which sounded like some magical wizard of oz movie soundtrack. We were really entertained to see all the servers go to the birthday girl, blowing horns, flashing lights and waving colored strobe light sticks welcoming her to a birthday dance while Lil' Jon is played through the speakers. Our server was very attentive and made us laugh. He wasn't the only person who helped us, we were helped or approached by almost every employee who walked past us. We were even greeted by the Manager Luis, who was very polite and professional. Overall, this place has a well deserved 5 star rating from me. Whether you're on a hunt for great Premium Korean BBQ, on a first time date, or even celebrating a birthday, Mr. BBQ is just the place to do so. We will definitely be back!!!
Now what to do about the Korean BBQ smell permeating my clothes??<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">That guy Sean......ruined our night. Worst service I've ever had and I'm a regular customer. This place is awesome I love it there and the whole staff is super friendly. I'm not sure if he was having a rough night or what not but he was RUDE as hell. I hope that was the first and last time he treats anyone the way he did to us.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Line was hectic but definitely worth it. Great service and the food was to die for. The price was affordable, will be coming here more often !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE KBBQ PLACE!!

The wait during lunch time is around 10-15 minutes which isn't bad at all. 
The interior is very clean, it's very similar to Gen.
Once we were seated, ice cold water was brought out immediately and our waitress began taking our orders. 

This place has, hands down, the best service that I've ever recieved at any kbbq place. They're super fast when bringing out new plates of meat unlike Red Palace and always refill our banchan without us even asking! I was so happy with our service, it's honestly so rare nowadays. 
We got the basic like brisket and bulgogi which were both delicious! 
They even had steak, mussels, and squid. There are also FOUR types of pork belly on the lunch menu and they were all fantastic! 

The potatoe salad and japchae were my favorite along with the pickled radish and kimchi. There's an abundance of banchan to choose from and they were suprisingly, ALL delicious and enjoyable. I even ate the salad, which I never do at any other kbbq place. 

Since it was my friend's birthday, we asked then to sing for her after our meal. The WHOLE entire floor staff came out with like tambourines and a bazooka (is that what it's called? Idk) and sang Happy Birthday to her. They were really fun and made our experience really memorable. 

I love this place and will definitely be back for the fine service and delicious food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The wait on Christmas Day was 1 hr for a party of four is not bad. The meat quality was good, but this place is a little pricier than other ayce kbbq. It's $22.99 for dinner. There's the pricier option than this which comes with filet mignon. Did I mention that they have vegetarian option? The service is great. The waitress refill our side dishes and asked if we wanted more meat without us calling out for her.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you are not Korean you will be passed up in line every time despiste whatever wait time you were quoted. 

Oh and almost an hour later we got skipped yet again for a 6 top. It is the most racist establishment that I have ever had the displeasure of being served at.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really really good better then Gen in my opinion! Clean lots and lots of sides. Extremely attentive waiters and P.s. Happy hour is basically All day! Glad my friend took me! Can't wait to go back again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can go on and on and on about the great things at Mr. Bbq. For starters, their meat is so good. For $27.99 (I think), you can get everything on their menu which includes Filet Mignon, Galbi, Ribeye, HangJungSal, Scallops, and even Beef tongue if that's what you're into. I think its worth paying more for since their meat is high in quality. However, sticking to the $20 something dollar menu is fine too.

I love how they have AYCE Pumpkin (Hobak), Mushroom, & Onion- I don't know where they buy their Pumpkin from, but it is the sweetest Hobak i've ever had.

Oh &! They give you free Ice Cream @ The end of it all! Yay "free" ice cream 

Bad points: parking sucks, long wait at times, and they have to sing and dance at every single person's birthday, which is festive, but really loud<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When it comes to Korean BBQ, I'd consider myself a seasoned veteran.  I have had Korean BBQ in all of the major metropolitan K-towns including NYC, Annandale, Tacoma, Skokie, and of course, all over Norcal and Socal - I travel quite a bit.
  
It all boils down to the quality of the meat.  And, I'm sorry to say that the quality of the meat at Mr BBQ isn't much better than other places that charge a lot less money.  Maybe it's because everywhere you look, there is an AYCE?  Maybe there is a shortage of cows?  

I am not comparing the chicken, pork or any of the other items found on an AYCE (or PAYCE) menu these days.  I am talking about kalbi (or galbi), aka boneless short ribs - both marinated, and not.

Mr BBQ's most expensive option ($27.99) listed Marinated Beef Short Rib as one of their signature meat items.  I ordered it and they literally brought me a single piece of  "3-bone marinated short rib", aka "L.A. Kalbi".  This was not cool.  Especially if you are not interested in any of the other meat items.

Mr BBQ offers lots of side dishes, but nothing that makes you say "Wow."  This restaurant is located in a great location with great parking.  Something you can appreciate.  But, be prepared to wait upwards an hour, or more, depending on when you get here.  It's a little more trendy looking than your average AYCE restaurant with TV's located in every direction you look.  Waiting area has some board games, and you can drink while you wait for your table.

Atmosphere is busy.  Service is above-average, but can bottle neck a bit depending on the night of the week.

If you're looking for the present hipster, AYCE KBBQ, this might fit your bill.  If you're looking for great cuts of meat with savory marinade, you may be disappointed with the price.

I did give it 4-stars because our server was cool.  They bring out ice cream for the guests.  Kids are about half price.  Parking was simps.  Location was good.

Enjoy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Out of all the Korean BBQ spots in Orange County, Mr BBQ is hands down, the best one right now! 

Honest truth, I waited 2 hours to eat here and it was definitely worth it! Yes, the wait time sounds awful, but they actually have a big waiting area where you can actually order drinks & play some board games to make the time pass by quicker. 

The quality of the meat here is really good quality and the marinades are delicious. I am the type of girl who usually just stick to brisket and pork belly at kbbq, but here I tried everything and enjoyed everything! I would definitely recommend the spicy pork belly - wow, it was definitely one of my favorite thing here! I also LOVE the idea of ice-cream that is already scooped for you for dessert! I always hate how unsanitary other kbbq is with their free ice-cream and how long the line is to get free ice-cream, but here, they're so smart! The quality of the ice-cream here is also really really delicious, so make sure you don't pass on it!

The customer service here is also outstanding. This is probably one of the first kbbq spots I've been to without a service bell, but I didn't even need one since they were very attentive. We requested about 10 different things at once and surprisingly, they remembered and brought everything! They also do a little something for Birthdays so I would recommend celebrating Birthdays here too!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely the best all you can eat korean bbq ive had. Excellent customer service as well.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My husband and I love this place! The food is great!!!! If you like Korean BBQ you need to check it out!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fantastic. Amazing food and even better service! The atmosphere is clean and fun! Beautiful displays and lighting. I will bring the rest of my family here once I get hungry enough to eat again! Lol My kids gobbled up every bite and kept asking for more!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here after seeing it got so many good reviews on Yelp and was craving some Korean bbq. 

Honestly it was whatever. Paid the extra for the extra meats and honestly it wasn't worth it. The food was whatever taste like any other Korean bbq place. Nothing amazing that made it stand out for me. 

The staff though is really nice which is why I gave it 2 stars. 

Wait and parking make it not worth it and apart of me wishes I had left after hearing it would be an hour wait. 

Probably would not come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow, all Kbbq places should be like this! From their awesome food to their over the top customer service, I was impressed with everything! This was my third time eating at Mr BBQ and I'm still at an awe for how good they are. 

Food: Best Korean bbq joint in Orange County. Their meat doesn't have that frozen texture that you might get from other kbbq places.  It seems like their marination it spot on with the meat or seafood they offer. Their beef belly and steak is a definite must-have. The quality of their meat here just tastes a lot better than a lot of places I've been to. Their seafood was also very spot on. Shrimp was very sweet and mussels are thoroughly washed. This place is no joke, they definitely know how to prep a mean kbbq dinner. 

Service: Their food is what keeps me coming back but their customer service is what puts them over the top from those other KBBQ restaurants in Orange County.  Our hostess, Tanya, was extremely friendly. She kindly greeted us as we placed our name on the wait list. Our server Christine was also very pleasant. For a busy restaurant like theirs, Christine never once got mad or irate for every time we placed an order or have a request.  If only all restaurant service was like theirs. Truly great customer service from top to bottom. 

All in all, this place is great. Their food is amazing and their customer service is even better. As a satisfied customer I will be looking forward to my future visits to Mr BBQ. Keep it up guys!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely without a doubt, the best Korean BBQ spot I have ever grilled beef at.

Two things that make Mr. BBQ superior:
1. Customer Service
2. Meat quality

The best part of Mr. BBQ once you get seated from the long wait is the service.  These guys are on top of their game.  Your hard pressed to find a moment where you need help and someone isn't already at your table tending to you.

Both times I went we tried the $20.99 AYCE menu, I'd have to say all of the meats on that menu are amazing.  The team is diligent at tending to the grill, side dishes, and clearing of empty plates.  All the while they make sure you have fresh meat to put on your grill.

My favorite meats:
- Marinated Beef belly
- Waygu cuts
- Hawaiian sausage
- Bulgogi
- Brisket

Downsides if I had to point them out would be the parking situation on busy nights.  If it is park in the neighborhood nearby, but check the parking signs so you don't get a ticket.  

Also, if you like to dine in peace and quiet this may not be the most intimate spot for that.  Similar to Farrel's, birthday celebrations are loud and could annoy. 

Additionally remember that even on weeknights there is a wait, so prepare yourself for the busy times.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's my 5th time back and honestly this place is by far the best AYCE Korean BBQ I have ever had.  The quality of the meat is always consistently great!  My favorites here are premium wagu finger short ribs, and premium beef brisket.  Everything else is awesome as well but those two are a must!!! (Unless you don't eat beef of course)  My girl recommends the Pork ribs and the pork neck (she doesn't eat beef) Everyone I have brought here have all raved about it.  Henry was our waiter for the night and Brian came to help out when he went on break.  Honestly this is the first time in months where I actually wanted to tip  because the service was that good!!!  I guarantee you can't go wrong coming here and you'll probably not want to go anywhere else after trying this place.
It's $22.99 for regular menu and $29.99 for premium menu (for dinner) 
Ps don't forget to ask for the ice cream for dessert.  So delish!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great AYCE meat choices with tons of awesome banchan.

If you're not a fan of all the cooking involved at KBBQ, have no fear, the super friendly servers practically do all the work for you! Someone is constantly stopping by your table to reload the grill with meats, chop cooked items, flip, stir, serve, ask for banchan refills... and just help out any way they can, really.

We've tried the Portuguese suasage, teriyaki chicken, spicy garlic pork, brisket, pork belly and probably a few others I'm forgetting. The sausage is a delicious salty addition to the usual KBBQ suspects, served with a mustard dipping sauce, it was a great flavor addition to the meal. The chicken teriyaki wasn't a dish we'd normally go with, but we wanted to try it out and see how they do with it - Simple, sweet soy flavors with hints of garlic and ginger. This was way more on the sweet side than usual korean style marinated chicken, which they also offer, but still very good! The pork belly is a stand out winner and high quality compared to other OC bbqs we frequent, and the brisket is a notch above the rest, too.

I found myself going back for more and more of the pickled pink radish wrappers and using those a vehicle to get the meats and other banchan in my mouth. There were at least 20 little banchan plates and they are ALL super fab. 

The prices are a little higher than other AYCE but well worth it for quality and some of the most attentive service of my life.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went for lunch on Wednesday afternoon
And the service was great! 
Can't wait to go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the best All You Can Eat KBBQ place in the area! They have excellent service! 30 members of my family decided to all eat here for a surprise birthday party. JT, as well as some other staff members, took care of our whole party. They serve quality meat and a various amount of sides. The pork belly, brisket, and beef is absolutely delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I so wish I could give this place 5 stars.  The meat selection is impressive and the service awesome.  The reason for the deduction is because the seafood us questionable.  Why spend so much money on good meat only to serve bad seafood?  Shrimp and scallops were not fresh at all, very fishy...not in the good way either.  But our waitress was bomb :D<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like this place. 
Way better than Gen, its not comparable. 
Parking can get hectic because there are not that many spots. The wait time also gets long, so I try to always go at a random time.  

The prices for dinner 1 is around $23 and to upgrade to dinner 2 is about $30. There are better quality meat of course in dinner 2. I highly recommend that! I personally like every single thing on their menu. For lunch you can also order dinner menu so don't you worry. 

Service is great! The vibe is great! 2 hrs max. 
Good for birthday celebration too!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I motha effing love this place!!
 waiting time only took about 15 minutes,
and within those 15 minutes.
we played card games which was pretty cool while waiting to be seated 
 they give you a pager until a table is up for grabs!

plus it was Halloween so it was even much better.

 customer service:  is amazing even though they weren't our waiters,they still accommodated us with the things that we needed. very great place for family dinners, to bring friends.

Food:  oh my goodness everything is definitely super DieLicous! (Yes I said Die) hella Fat girl problems for me to the max!!

I suggest everyone come and check this place out.
 look at the pictures, but the taste in the meat in the way its marinated and the way they do things is so organized and no clusterF**** 

 they have $1 valet parking; I mean It can't get any better than that.
Plus it was Halloween and if it's your birthday..the servers  come and greet you with a great Gundam style happy birthday! 

Decore': pretty awesome great atmosphere very clean, trendy, big screens playing sports games;
good music and free candy since it was Halloween everybody was way chill, great vibes.

P.s.
Thanks for the free good expensive name brand candies! And not your Dr. Office bootleg lollies! 
(=^,^=) 
Very well worth the visit!!!!! ×10000
P.s.s
THOSE GREEN JELLO SHOTS THO. DEF A TREAT!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried Mr. BBQ for the first time tonight. It was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! Our server was great and the food was exceptional. We will definitely be back. I highly recommend it!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great customer service !!!!
Great food and way better than Gen BBQ ;) 
I love their beef bellyyy ..yum yum<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always come here with small groups to large groups! Great place for parties or catching up

Context: Came here with two others on one occasion, another time with a group of 5, and another a group of like 12. All times have never been a problem. The group of 12 though, they split us up so that sucked. Just depends if you're willing to wait or not

Environment: Club-like/colorful lights and family friendly environment. Not sure how to explain, but it's more colorful and fun than most AYCE KBBQ places! For your birthday, they go crazy and have cute little props and stuff and start singing. It's a fun place!

Food: 
* Beef brisket: Major noms! Love the brisket here
* Beef tongue: My all time favorite! 
* Bulgolgi: I generally don't like bulgolgi at all, but my friends loved it here
* Shrimp: You get I believe 4 pieces, pretty tasty!
* And a bunch of others I don't remember, but overall very good!
* Sauces: Oil with salt/pepper, sweet sauce, spicy sauce
* Drinks: They have beer towers here! 

Service: Service here is good! My only complaint is when it's someones birthday, they're all anal and ask for Facebook or ID. Like, bro, I'm gunna ask the birthday person for their ID and pretend I didn't request anything and I deactivated my Facebook for finals (totally serious bout dis). Like, okay? 

Overall: Chill place, great service, and yummy food<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">RECOMMENDED. 

Went here for a birthday. Meet is pretty good for AYCE. They call PAYCE because Premium, $24/person, also they have a clever "PAYCE" banner on top of the exit door when you leave. Like PAYCE OUT!  but everything was pretty good. Kev helped us at first and he was awesome, just wish he was a little more present. Disappeared when we needed him most but that's usually how it goes anyways. Had to ask for moar water, ponzu sauce, sesame oil, side dishes, and meat occasionally. Kev left and Sean stepped in, he was awesome too. Maybe a little better but maybe. We only had him for like 20 mins before we got the check. Anyways. They have a beeper/vibrating pager thing for you to hold on to while you wait. We waited like 5 mins for a table of 6. Nbd. Wasn't too busy. Meat is better than GEN KBBQ!! We'll be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Did my check-in not register earlier this evening?  Oh well.  I brought my niece and her boyfriend here since they were visiting from Fresno and Sacramento.  They did a few things in LA for the first time and figured might as well introduce them to some Korean bbq.  Of course K-town would have been ideal but honestly.... we were just too pooped to go too far out of town and being as how they are college kids.... well Mr. BBQ seemed to fit nicely.

Great experience.  The meats were more fresh and tender than I had remembered.  Bonus, the place was not as packed is it usually is.  To top it all off, our server, Kim was outstanding.  I'm not sure how to put into words her promptness, proactiveness, friendliness, and overall excellent service.  If I were you, I'd ask for Kim next time you come.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is top notch I was really impressed. 
THE SERVICE IS AWESOME . All the staff was gracious, helpful and non-invasive. this place was busy and we did not once feel like we were ignored and that's a huge plus! I really enjoyed myself. there were a few birthday parties and watching them sin to them was great! I recommended this place to anyone in the area or willing to make the drive it is a little pricier than the premium KBBQ spots in K-town but I would come here again for the service and atmosphere... We had to wait about 20min to be seated but it didn't seem that long thanks to the Games they have in the waiting area... We played A little Rummy and connect four as we waited<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Dope ayce korean bbq spot its a little pricier than other spots but their meats are much better quality and melt in your mouth buttery yummm. Service was super quick too, anything we ordered came out to us in under a minute. Kev our waiter was super attentive, chill, and on top of things.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Overrated in my opinion. 

If you were to do a blind taste test with the meat here and from another KBBQ place, I seriously doubt you'd be able to tell the difference. It's all hype.

Mr. BBQ is number 27 on Yelps Top 100 for 2016. They offer "premium all you can eat". Where was the premium? Maybe a premium long wait (over an hour). That's about all that was premium at this place. Meat tastes like any other meat. It's not bad, it tasted great but to call it premium is a stretch.

The service was great though. Our server (Crystal?), did an excellent job and was always around when we needed her. 

Parking here is AWFUL! There's just not enough spaces. People were parking at the Del Taco across the street. I was lucky and got a spot right away as another car was pulling out. The parking situation alone makes me not want to come here.

Mr. BBQ, I don't hate you but I don't like you either. You're a phony, a big fat phony. I would not go out of my way to eat here again. Also I would not wait over an hour to eat average KBBQ.

For real premium meats, go to Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am quite the fan when it comes to Korean BBQ and even more so when it's AYCE (all-you-can-eat). I usually make an effort to eat lighter meals throughout the day to reserve space for the evening when I know I'm going to get ayce kbbq. I have heard about Mr BBQ from a few friends and they agree that it's one of the best places in Orange County. Unlike most Korean BBQ establishment, they offer PAYCE (the P stands for "premium") with two price tiers to choose from. The standard with 27 items is $20.99 while the $26.99 features 10 additional selections, such as steak or seafood. 

With a group of 14 celebrating a friend's birthday, we tried to coordinate an early arrival, but we didn't beat the crowd. By the time we had arrived at 6pm on a Saturday evening, the parking lot was full and a few parties were already ahead of us (some were celebrating birthdays too!) I was lucky and found a spot in the lot, but friends parked in nearby neighborhood and walked over to the restaurant. 

However, that didn't deter us from our plans. We got comfortable in the outside patio and indulged in a few libations while we waited, which was about an hour. Two beer towers and a soju cocktail later, we were seated at three separate tables, but close enough to keep our group intact. 

As we settled into our seats, we immediately got to ordering. With most of us being first timers at Mr BBQ, our server Justincredible was ... incredibly helpful and friendly while we made our decisions. I assumed responsibility for cooking so I just fired off a few things to start, along with drinks. Once our orders was placed, Joshua (whom we dubbed Josh "Ooo-Wah") brought out about 15 variations of banchan side dishes. The side dishes are small and began to crowd the table, but we ate our fill and stacked some dishes to make space for the meat. 

I was hoping to take more pictures, but I was absorbed in the moment, haha. It's a little difficult to not do so  when the table you're seated at has all the loud people of our group at one table, even though I'm one of the loud ones, lol. We just have the sort of voices/laughter that you can hear in any situation or setting. So here are a couple things we got:

Brisket. We probably got about 2-3 plates of brisket because it's quick to cook and it tastes great. 

Beef Belly. Wow, this was so amazing! It helped grease up the grill so that other meats don't stick, but the tenderness of the beef from the fat gave it so much flavor. We definitely got another order of this to fill our bellies.

Thick cut and Fresh Pork Belly. Probably one of the best pork belly cuts I've had. The fat to meat ratio was beautiful and once cooked, the meat was juicy and tender. 

Premium Wagyu Marinated Finger Shortrib. For being a "premium wagyu" cut, I was a bit disappointed in texture. No matter how I cooked it from medium rare to medium to well done, the meat was a bit on the tougher side. Perhaps it wasn't cut against the grain? Not a favorite at our table. 

We also got a chance to try other things like miso marinated pork butt, beef tongue and housemade steamed eggs. Pretty much everything we tried was delicious.

What I enjoyed most about Mr BBQ is how they make birthdays feel like a special event. As the line of employees crowd the birthday guest with glowsticks, the music changes to a specified track (ours was "Turn Down for What", which is totally fitting for the birthday boy). We obviously sang happy birthday, which I'm sure the whole restaurant heard. After a couple drinks, we couldn't help but share the joy with everyone.

We may or may not be invited back after last weekend's debauchery. The night concluded with five bottles of soju and two carafes of yogurt soju (which we diluted with more soju). It's been about 4-5 years since I've had soju in excess, but perhaps the change in taste is to shed light on my upcoming trip to Korea? Lol!

Mr BBQ has won me over with superb service and great selection of quality meats. Thanks to Justincredible, Ericlicious and Joshua for putting up with us crazies, I wound like to return to try more of their selections. Maybe I'll try to go during lunch to avoid the crazy crowds. Until next time!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here several times, decided to come by and have lunch. Wanna say that my girlfriend and I had a great service from Henry. Cool dude, great customer service, and had great conversations with him. And as always the food was great, quality A+ 

Will likely come back again another time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was such a Gen fan. This is officially takin over ! Number one Korean BBQ spot. All you can eat 31.99$ for so many options including a full size ribeye and fliet<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here with a party of 7 people at 5pm. We were told the table nearest the front would be ours once the diners cleared out. Fast forward about 80 min, that table opened up and they were cleaning up. Good timing too because I was already salivating looking at the menu and smelling the aroma of all the smoke! We were all ready for our pager to go off but then somehow a group who came in later after us was seated in the table we were supposed to have. We went up to ask and the lady didn't know what happened. She said we were going to to get another table but by then we had waited close to 90 min. We had a reservation for Exodus escape room and waiting another 30+ min wasn't an option.

I guess the lesson is to give yourself plenty of wait time if you wanna come here. Wish I could've rated the food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to over a dozen or two different kbbq places from the oc to la and Mr. BBQ is different from the rest for a couple reasons. 

One is the entertainment. When you enter, they have tables in the general waiting area where they have uno and connect 4 so you can kill time which also indicates that the wait time here does get quite long but that's expected at most kbbq places anyways. On top of that, they got big screens and speakers around the restaurant so you can enjoy sports games or enjoy some background music while feasting with good company. The music they play here are newer American pop songs which differs from other kbbq joints that tend to mix it with kpop. Also if you are here for a birthday, they got a cool song and dance for you accompanied by a large scoop of ice cream!

The other thing that sets this joint a part from the rest is the meat and sides. The sides were damn good and the meat were quite fresh as comparable to Gen. They also have a wide selection of things to order from depending on menu which of course varies in price.

Overall, Mr. BBQ is a cool place to eat if you in the Fullerton area but if you are further away, there's better options I'm sure. Also the pricing is on the higher end of kbbq with dinner low at $20 per person.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr. BBQ is one of the my two favorite AYCE KBBQ ( the other one is BBQ Night) Let's start off with service here which is safe to say very pleasing. They're alert and there whenever you want to request for either more meat or changing grills. I was not expecting it to become my go-to place for kbbq since my friends always go here and I felt that they were giving it too much credit for I'm pretty picky with ayce kbbq which I turned out to be soo wrong at the end. Also, the atmosphere here is pretty modern and clean, the seatings are nice and spacious, The ventilation is efficient and won't leave you with a cloud of fog.

The meat here never fails to satisfy, it's always fresh and definitely can be recalled as some high quality meat. I get the premium brisket, beef belly, pork belly, large intestines, and my all time favorite: beef tongue, chewy and tender. Side dishes comes in a variety and is pretty good as well. I love tofu soup, but here it was considerably okay and was whatevers. This place also have complimentary ice cream if you still have room for dessert. Nice thing about it is they scoop it for you, too bad there isn't many flavors to choose from like others. But it still works out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">For a Korean bbq place to succeed in SoCal, you need to really stand out because the demand here for unlimted, simple grill-it-yourself thinly sliced bbq meats with a slew of colorful  mini side dishes is more than the need for water.  
This place has got to be my new all time favorite ayce Kbbq... like ever. The brisket is perfectly marbled, not too chewy and just ughhh so good. The beef belly is like little fatty pieces of meaty perfection - it's really hard to describe taste lol. The marinated choice sirloin is bomb and we just kept ordering even when we were so full because it was just too good T.T.
Service was incredible. Grill changes whenever it started getting charred. Turned down the flame when he saw the meat already cooked and ready to go. Turned it up when we got new meat and never had to wait more than 3 mins to get a new plate of meat from when I order it... Like seriously... just writing this makes me want to cry because I've never had such amazing service. 
We were quoted a 45 min to 1 hour wait, but got seated after 20 mins. *SHRUG* 
Oh and idk what sorcery is used to make their ice cream... because it's like whipped or something?! If heaven truly existed, I hope it's similar to Mr BBQ.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the place. I normally go to Gen but this place was close to my GF's house. 

I had to wait about an hour and a half but it was worth it. 

Love the Beef Tongue and short ribs. 

We will go again for sure.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Korean BBQ all you can eat. Lots of choices of meat to cook, including chicken, pork belly, pork butt, shrimp, squid, pork jowls, and some other stuff I'm not used to seeing. 
You cook the food yourself on a table with a grill. The waiter was very friendly and explained the process a d regularly came back to change our grill because the food gets burnt on them. Lots of small side dishes such as rice, rice paper, radishes, pickles, glass noodles, kimchi etc. they will bring as much as you want.

The place is VERY noisy inside! 

Everyone at my table enjoyed the experience, but it is just not my thing. To noisy, wait for food to be cooked, to much going on. I won't be back. 

They don't need me anyway, the place is crazy busy!! The meats are very good. You'll probably like it better than me!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The staff was extremely friendly but everything else was very lackluster. Restaurant is pretty loud (just a heads up) but that is to be expected with many people there. Meat was so dry and the soup was very watery. Not sure why there are so many reviews raving about the quality of the meat but I can honestly say this was the worst meat I've ever tasted at a Kbbq. The egg casserole was the best part of the meal for me. :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Obviously the people who think this place is bomb clearly do not know meat. Mind you I like AYCE because stuffing yourself until you can  explode is just something you should do without worrying too much about the bill.

First, there was ONLY valet available. Sorry this aint some fancy restaurant. Stop trying to take away more of our money. The lot was pretty huge so I am pretty damn sure everyone could fit in there without a problem. But, I could move on from that. 

Then, the wait. Ive seen some crazy lines before, but the one here was pretty long, especially at such a late hour. Honestly I expected there to be line because of all the hype, so I just waited patiently.

Ugh, the food, though. The two stews we got? Oh my god? Do you people even know what its supposed to taste like? No. Bland, disgusting. Tasted it once and didnt touch it again. Meat quality...sigh. I think even Moodaepo might have better quality than this. Dried up, frozen, and not fresh... 

On top of that, price was ridiculous. At non AYCE kbbq like Kanghodong Baek Jeong, the LARGE combo that feeds 5 people is less than $100. If those 5 people came here, the bill would easily come out to at least $150. Oh wait $155. There is that stupid valet + tip for the valet guy to drive your car up for 10 seconds of course -_-. 

And my final straw was. There were SIX MOTHAFUCKING BIRTHDAYS in that ONE hour I was there. And they BLAST the same exact birthday edm remix weird song for each person and ALL the workers need to go up to their table and start chanting and screaming. 

I was so glad to get out of there hahaha see you never mr bbq.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Who doesn't love beer towers and soju? Best KBBQ in the area, no doubt.  Yes there's a long wait on weekends, but that's the nature of KBBQ, no? Just go grab a drink at The Back Room. They have lots of options for AYCE and they always have lots of banchan, though during peak hours it doesn't get refilled as quickly. The staff are all very nice and service is pretty quick because they're trying to get you in and out but they're not pushy at all. Overall a favorite establishment and my go-to when I want KBBQ bc no one has time to drive to Gen. Order the steamed egg you won't regret! The Hawaiian sausage is also delicious lol.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Can I give this place 10 stars?

Came in on September 11. (RIP to all the love ones lost on this date!)

Anyways on a lighter note , the hostess that worked this day. You were super sweet! Being the only hostess , you handled the lunch rush so well!

Also, I commend everyone that worked this shift for delivering a great performance and smile!

BUTTT, let's not forget the MVP of the day. JT! You were such a lovely server! Lovely .. Lol so girly right? But thank you for the full service . Recommendations, grill change, cutting the meat, checking up on us. The whole shabang! If I owned a restaurant , you would be hired on the spot.

The food here is always superb! ALL the sides! Omg and the presentation of each product . Amazing . Marinated short rib.. So delicious in seasoning. And of course you can't go wrong with brisket and pork belly! 

Only complaint ; open up some more please!! I have to drive all the way from Vietnam for this!! Hahah jk... But one in garden grove would be nice (:

Thank you Mr. Bbq . Always an excellent experience .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The cons... Mr BBQ isn't close to my house.

That's really the ONLY bad thing I can say.  Mr. BBQ is the best AYCE kbbq I've been to in OC, and its not even close.  

When you get there, there will likely be a wait.  Go to the bar on the other side of the building to get a drink or two while you're waiting.  Great selection of craft beers.  Its owned by the same owner as Mr BBQ (which is pure genius!), so while you're waiting they can track to see where you are in line, and will let you know when your table is ready.  

Now that had a good buzz, here's where the good stuff begins.

Mr BBQ has a great overall experience.  Top notch service.  Clean, inviting location.  Its also a fun environment, you'll see a ton of parties going there for birthdays.  So if you're looking for a quiet spot, this isn't it.  

They have a basic and a premium AYCE option that you can choose from.  The basic does the job if you're looking for the standard kbbq - cha dol bae gi (brisket), san gyup sal (pork belly), galbi, beef tongue, etc.  The premium is pretty awesome too - you'll be able to get seafood options, filet, and other premium meats.  You can't go wrong either way, the quality of meat is really, really impressive for AYCE. 

Eveything else they do is top notch too, from the ban chan (side dishes) to the sauces.  Ask for the special Mr BBQ sauce, you won't be disappointed.

Mr. BBQ... i'll be back.  If you could only open up shop in Irvine I'd be there much, much more!<p>

This place by a long shot is my #1 place for ACYE kBBQ. The meats here are truly good quality and the price isn't ridiculous either (bonus - free ice cream). The service is really good here compared to many other places. Love that nearly all of the staffs party it up when it's your birthday and blasting edm. It's a good spot for large parties, but be warned that the wait is insanely long and also require you to valet your car during busy times. I come here off hours like 3-4pm and had to wait 30 minutes - not bad. But by the time I get out (6pm) hungry mobs everywhere outside.

Overall, yes I recommend it here. Both tiers of ayce are amazing. Come off peak times and you won't have to wait long.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">bomb place but it's always packed! make sure you come earlier than usual so you can definitely get a seat. love their clear noodle side dish. their salad a bit spicy but still good to munch on while waiting for the meats/seafood to arrive.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely amazing! Had to wait an hour on a Monday before getting seated but it was worth every minute. The food was spectacular and the service was fantastic! Everyone was very nice and very attentive. There was never a shortage of anything at our table. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes meat! Anything from chicken, to pork belly, to octopus and mussels! 

I will definitely be returning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Probably the best AYCE kbbq place in the OC. The quality of the food and service here is exceptional. They are so fast with bringing you your meat, refilling sides, changing your grill anything you could think of! The servers are very attentive and will always come back to check up on you just to make sure you have everything you need.

The waits are not too bad, they always over quote just to make sure not to upset their customers. They also recently changed to a valet system on busier nights. They do charge $1 for this service. I don't mind it personally because this place can get packed and the parking lot is very limited. So it is very considerate that they implemented this system.

Overall no complaints about the meat. The side dishes are on point. Definitely a 10/10!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service. They ran out of green tea ice cream our waitress scraped the bottom of the tub. I got a tablespoon worth of ice cream, but it hit the spot!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow!!  Ranked #27 in the country.  Is it worth it?

Absolutely.  Go at lunch when the line is more reasonable.  And a little cheaper.  

Outstanding service, great variety of meat, and huge banchan.  Is it better than Per Se?  Probably not, but its the best Korean BBQ in OC.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Five stars to my favorite Korean BBQ spot!!! 

Being the piggy I am, I have been to many ayce spots and would have to stall at mr BBQ takes the title for best ayce in oc. Sorry gen, Cham, star...

I really like the restaurant itself. Nice environment, clean, air conditioned. 

Along with that the service has always been a plus! They are very attentive and make sure you are full of sides and that your meat is coming. I love how the servers actually want to help you unlike other spots where it seems like you have to force them to serve you. 

THE FOOD: 
Sides are so good and I love the variety. You got salad, glass noodles, potato salad, and a million other little sides to enjoy. 

The meats are great quality ! I like the brisket, spicy pork, bulgolgi and the mr BBQ! The mr bbq is very tasty. 

One thing I will say is that they took off the mr BBQ meat and egg soup off their lunch menu. I am very disappointed but guess I just have to come back for dinner!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can't feel my face when I eat you, Mr. BBQ... . 

AYCE KBBQ with some premium quality meats. The overall atmosphere of this place is trendy & very hip and suiting for college students. I mean, we are only down the street from CSUF. Once I walked in, they had a sign posted up stating that they are ranked #27 in the US top places to eat for 2016! That says something...

If this place is so good, how's the wait? When I always come, there is ALWAYS a wait! Literally, always. I've had my fair share of lunches and dinners here. The menu stays the same. Pricing in comparison to other KBBQ places are a little more, but so worth it once you dig your teeth into the meats. If you come for dinner & have a long wait, head to their small bar in the bac, "The Back Room". Good place to kill time & have a few drinks.

They have your usuals, brisket, beef tongue, marinated short rib, etc. My absolute fave here is the brisket. Idk what it is, but I love it.

Lots of parking, and sometimes they have valet! Overall, one of my top places to come eat!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mr. BBQ-Well so much has been said, but I had to add to it.  My husband took me and our daughter here today for my belated birthday dinner at Mr. BBQ! Korean BBQ turned out to be a truly fun (and totally filling) experience. And this spot has incredible meats and seriously AMAZING waitstaff. 

The standard PAYCE on weekends is the dinner on weeknights.  And let me tell you the selection and quality on that list is terrific!  While grilling your own meat might seem like a bit of work, it really kind of brings the table together with talking, grilling, and eating. We tried every beef and seafood option on the list and threw in the Teriyaki chicken as well. So good!  We also got the miso marinated pork belly, which had a great taste, but was a bit over the top fatty for us.  This is probably more due to eating tons of pork (yay carnitas) lately. My favorites were the marinated baby squid and the beef belly.  OMG, BEEF BELLY!!  Why have I not heard of this piece of deliciousness before?  Although to be honest I like just about every thing we had tonight (and it was a ton!).

But I have to tell you, it was our server Christine that took this outstanding meal and made it utterly AMAZING! She changed out the grill like 10 times, helped with suggestions, got meat to us quickly, refilled the banchan whenever asked (and sometimes when she saw it empty), and kept water at hand. Seriously, she treated us like we were VIP guests from the moment we sat down until she handed us the check with a bow and a Thank You! And from what I saw, she did the same for every table she had. It is the first time in a long time that we have seen and experienced such service. She made our meal that much more special. And she topped it off with a complimentary scoop of pistachio complete with a candle, cherry,  and a most embarrassing join in dance (but in a fun way!). 

So to recap, terrific meats and delicious banchan coupled with INCREDIBLE service, makes this a go to for special occasion meals in a heartbeat. Amazing how have such incredible service takes everything up a notch.  Christine seriously has made me question every putting up with the way sub par service we have gotten here and there for the sake of decent food. I look forward to returning for both the meal and the service!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is honestly the best Korean BBQ place I've ever been to in Southern California. Amazing meats. Great upbeat service. Very attentive waiters which is a huge plus when eating Korean BBQ. All the sides were fully refilled as the night went on. Spicy Pork Butt is the best they have personally. Love this place. Would eat here 24/7 if I could. Come here now and experience true Korean BBQ at its best.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Got to say the 2 hour wait for 2 people was pretty insane and the only reason this place gets 4 stars. If it wasn't for the wait it would be 5. Sean was our server and he was super nice, overall good place to go & eat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Let me start by saying this place is Ah-MAZE-ing!

I visited with a good friend who read about this place on Yelp.  Upon entering it was neat to see how modern and clean  it felt.   They had games like Connect4 UNO and other cards that you could play while waiting, alas we did not have to wait and were immediately seated.

Upon being seated we were greeted by our waiter and he explained how it worked, since we never had been here before.   We decided on the all you can eat lunch which is reasonably priced at $14.99 and has quite the array of meats to choose from.  We asked for some suggestions and ordered them.   

Upon bringing the neat to the table our waiter "slim Tim" put some on our grill and assisted with cutting and properly cooking it.

The service was fantastic and the quality of meat was fresh tasted great and seemed to be of the highest quality.

The only negative is they do not have a soda fountain and only serve their soft drinks in a can.

I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.   Do yourself a favor and try Mr BBQ I know I'll be back!<p>
