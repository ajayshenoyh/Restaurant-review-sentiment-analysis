<p itemprop="description">I ordered two Pad Thais and some Massaman curry (my stand by with tofu and brown rice), and an appetizer plate to go and waited with my companion.  I knew I was at a good spot because it was Friday night at like 6pm and this place was popping. 

So first thing first, it's easy to get burnt out on Thai food. I mean, how often can you eat Pad Thai and not get bored of the same old thing? The thing is, I'm ready to burn myself out on this Thai food.  

Pad Thai: solid. One of my friends got chicken and the other beef/chicken and I heard no complaints.  I swiped a meatless bite and was impressed with their dish.  One commented that there were a lot of bean sprouts, but I like the bean sprouts m'self. 

Massaman curry: I ordered it medium and it was just the right amount of heat.  This dish was not overwhelmingly 'dairy' or creamy, which I liked.  I think the tofu was fried, which was ok.  I prefer steamed.  The brown rice I got with the curry was awesome because it was actually the dark brown rice with the nutty flavor instead of the kinda brown rice that most places have.  

Appetizer plate: it was a tempura veggie plate. Not bad! I appreciated their usage of mushrooms for tempura.  Everything had a slight 'sog' to it.  Perhaps eating it fresh at the restaurant would have been better. 

A solid Thai place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pad Thai: I liked that it wasn't sweet but this dish was lacking in all the other flavors at the same time. Bland, oily, skimpy on the bean sprouts, no lime.

Fried rice: also no flavor and super greasy. 

Service was terrible today. As I was waiting for our to-go order that was apparently sitting on the counter getting cold, I watched the waitress snap at customers and almost run children over with the dirty dish cart. Whoa.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Disappointed with the service and food. Please improve your customer service. We ordered food to go and it came out but it was hidden behind a counter and no one gave it us or told us that it was ready. We ended up waiting for 32 minutes for our food that had just been sitting there out of sight. Are you kidding me?! 

Pad Thai and fried rice was bland. For the price, the portions were small. Wish I could write a more positive review.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is a hit or miss now. Depends on who is cooking your food.

I usually order pad thai and fresh spring rolls. Like I said hit or miss (50% chance you will get good food): 

You know it's a miss when the pad thai tastes like nothing but oily noodles.
You know it's a miss when the fresh spring rolls has no cilantro/basil/mint leaves, and has barely any veggies... and wrapped thickly with the rice paper.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great place for thai food.

Hubby and I have been coming to this place on-and-off for a good 5 or 6 years.  We weren't in the area very much in the past, but that's now changed.  Whenever we have our thai food cravings, we tend to go over here, whether to dine in, or to order online and pick up.  

Staff has always been good.  Never had any issues.

Prices are okay.  Not cheap, but it won't break the bank.  Reasonable for the amount of food you get, and for the quality of food.

We've had a good amount of items on the menu, from curry, pad thais, pad see ews, summer rolls, egg rolls, chicken entrees, fried rice, etc.  I think our favorite items to get are the summer rolls, any of the fried rice, and any thick-noodle entree.  Every single one is pretty freakin' awesome :)

Now, if you're worried about spice, they have levels 1 to 10, so you can get it pretty mild.  They have really good vegetarian dishes, and I think they basically have a menu that is good for anyone and everyone.  

Parking's not too bad.  Good-size shopping center, so you won't have much of an issue there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I tried to order through yelp and even though I waited at least 25 minutes to pick up my order I still had to wait half an hour after paying for them to put my order in. What's the point? The food wasn't anything worth praising. I ordered my larb mild and it was just salty. Mild should have a slight spice or else you'd normally ask for no spice at a Thai place but ok. I ordered sticky rice which was too sticky and hard like it was old and reheated. My sticky rice with mango dessert was to-go yet the poured coconut sauce all over it. They had sauce in a cup packed so why would you pour it already and offer more sauce? Now it's drenched and I was intending to save it for the next day. Blah. Waitresses are terrible hosts that had no idea who I was and what I was waiting for after asking me a dozen times over and over. Need better coordination there definitely.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my favorite Thai place in the OC. I've been coming here for years (since I was 12....I'm almost 22 now!!!!) I just haven't gone around to writing a review ever. I LOVE THAI BASIL. Everything about my experience here is great. 

To start: the staff is awesome. They are so kind and attentive and really know what's on the menu, back and forth. They're very good at recommendations so don't hesitate to ask! My dad loves to try new things & always likes what he gets because of the server recommendations!

Food: I personally don't like to try new things lol so I just stick to my favorites.

1) Pineapple fried rice: it's amazing here. I love that they sub tofu for me, since I'm vegetarian. The rice is really good because it's not overly sweet nor is it too yellow like other places make it. It has the right amount of flavors.
2) Pad Thai: Pad Thai is good and very big! It's a good amount for me to take home and eat later. It's not super sweet either like some other places, but if you want you can add more peanut sauce.
3) cashew nut tofu- I got this once when I was trying to try something new and personally didn't like it that much. LOL that's what I get for trying something new. It tasted good with rice mixed in, but I'm going to stick to pineapple fried rice!

It's located in a complex with a dollar tree! Right down the street from CSUF which is so nice for the students there to get some authentic Thai food! 

I've been coming here for over 10 years and I definitely encourage everyone to try this place at least once. I'll be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Experience starts when you walk through the door. Our waitress was rude. NO smile. Annoyed that we ordered water. Seemed overall annoyed.

After our water was dropped off, waitress disappeared and never came back for our order. 
A different waitress came by, only after we waved her down, and took our order. 

Food:
Pineapple Chicken Curry- was VERY bland and watered down.
Pad See Ew w Beef- was good.
Rice 

The check was dropped off with our food. 
Total of $22.59. 
I feel like this was overpriced for mediocre and bland dishes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the area. I love how flavorful everything is here! I usually get the Tom Yum Soup, Chicken Satay, and another dish (usually random). The soup is so so so good! I like it spicy, so I'd get medium spicy. It's the best to have when it's cold outside. I've tried one of the green curry dishes there, too. It'a super creamy and flavorful. I believe they use coconut as one of the ingredients, so it's super creamy!!!
Customer service is good. Sometimes it gets busy and it'd be hard to get a hold of the employees. 
Overall, love love love the food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Friendly service.
But the food is really overpriced considering how little the portion is. Would not recommend<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I rate this restaurant 2.5 stars.

To sum up, 2 of the 4 items we ordered were just ok, all of the items were a small portion for the price, and the wait time to receive our order was unusually long.

We ordered pad thai with pork, chicken yellow curry with bamboo shoots, beef with onion and green chile, and mango with sticky rice for dessert.  

The pad thai with pork was just ok.  Tons of beans sprouts-the proportion of beans sprouts to noodles was 1:1.  And nothing special-it was missing diced green onion and cilantro.  

The yellow chicken curry with bamboo shoots was also just ok.  The dish should be called bamboo shoot curry with a bit of chicken because oddly enough there was 2 times more bamboo shoots than chicken.   Very little chicken in dish.  Plus the curry fell flat.  We asked for it to be prepared spicy-7 out of 10 spicy-and it was not spicy at all...in fact it was bland and sweet.  Disappointing.

The dish we enjoyed the most was the beef with green chile and onion.  The beef was tender, the green chile (or sliced jalapenos) were spicy and fresh, and the onion was sauteed to perfection.  The sauce-a light oyster sauce with sauteed garlic and chile was excellent.

Finally we had mango with sticky rice.  The dessert was excellent.  Again, like all other dishes, there was a mismatch between portion size and price.

We were struck by the small portions of all dishes.  At $9 an entree we are used to eating about half the entree and taking the rest home.  We didnt eat more than usual.   The serving size was scarce.  

We noticed on our way out, however, that the entree portion sizes at other tables were easily double what we were served..not sure why???  Was it because we were a group of 2, and the tables we saw had 3-4 people?

I should also mention we ordered a hot tea.  The green jasmine tea tasted and smelled like soapy water.  At first I thought the cup may have had soapy remains from a dish wash but I smelled the tea directly from the kettle and it had the same odd soapy smell.  I returned the tea and opted for water.

Finally, the wait time to receive our food was long-at least 40 minutes.  Not sure what the hold up was but it certainly took a loooong time to receive our food.

My overall tip--skip this restaurant.  Look for a restaurant with a better balance of authentic flavors and lower prices or more generous portions<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service: I came here at lunch hour on a weekday because I had a gap between classes. So I could understand that the waitresses are busy and whatnot but that really doesn't excuse the bad service I got! The waitress I had wasn't very friendly and rushed everything. For example, when she brought out my food, she had brought along the check. Like whaaaa?! I've never had any restaurant do that to me and have never felt so rushed to get out of there. 
Food: I ordered the veggie pad Thai. It was a pretty small portion compared to other Thai restaurants I've gone to and taste-wise, it was just okay. Not good, not bad, just mediocre.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Small place near CSUF right next to Office Depot, Pieology, Dollar Tree... We were seated right away for an early dinner.

Service:
- Good service. She kept our water's refilled the entire night.

Food (ranking): family style!
1. Chinese broccoli fried rice with shrimp
- My favorite dish for sure. It had a ton of flavor, but was a tad bit oily. Nonetheless, I would order this again

2. Catfish Curry
- Really tasty! Not as soupy as most curries, but I did enjoy this dish. Might have been the first time I've tried catfish to be honest haha

3. Tofu pad kae mao
4. Tom yum goong
- Both of these can go together because it was way too spicy for me to eat. My friends like spicy food so we chose two non spicy and two spicy. The couple bites I had did have good flavor, but I would rather not sweat when I eat.

Overall:
I'll be back to try other dishes. Cool spot!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is our Go-To lunch spot for my office. They have something everyone likes and their service has always been great! Now you can order online so it makes it even easier. Prices are great and the lunch specials can't be beat; you get your main course, rice, a won ton, and a spring roll for under $10. Highly recommend this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They deliver! && their chicken curry is delicious && their soup! 

I don't have a lot of
Time during a hectic week to make dinner every day,
So this place is a hunger savor!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tom Kah Talay  soup! Shrimp Spring Rolls! Chicken and Beef Pad Thai! 

These three items on the menu are my favorite and I'm in love! I can't even describe the taste of the soup! It's just delicious! It comes with shrimp, fish, scallops, calamari and clams! Oh dear sweet baby Jesus! It's just lovely! On a spice level... I get it at a 6 and it's not hot at all!(Just to give an idea of the spiciness!) I still add some chili in there but that's because I just need to have heat! 

All else is really good too! Shrimp Spring Rolls are always an enjoyment! :) Three per order and comes with that peanut sauce that I have come to love! The Pad Thai has been really tasty too (PEANUTS IN THIS DISH) They do offer lunch specials but I'll be honest and say I haven't been here for lunch! 

The service has always been good, very friendly! I have had to ask for items but it doesn't bother me! They do bring it right away! My order took about fifteen minutes to get to our table on a Friday evening which I don't think was bad at all! 

Plenty of parking! I do think your kids can take in food from other restaurants but I'm not sure(I've seen families do it with my own two eyes)! I haven't tried but if my kids ever go with me I just might try because of the food allergy situation my son has! Some restaurant owners have issues with this! 

FOUR STARS!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would give zero stars if I could ...

Our server was a bitch for no reason even though we were nice. And they brought out cold curry .... That's never okay. Never coming here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is satisfying but various items lack the punch of flavor I've come to love about Thai food.
For example the satay sauce is rather bland and the cuke salad,  as well.  The sauce in the fish with ginger and the calamari with basil were both packed with flavor. However, there were few veggies or herbs in the dish, so much so that to mention basil in the name and put 1 leaf in left me disappointed. The brown rice is great for a change (not sure what kind it really is, red rice?). If you're looking for a basic Thai restaurant that will leave you satisfied but maybe not impressed,  Thai Basil does the job.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place seriously one of the BEST Thai Restaurant in OC.  They are always super clean and the employees are consistently friendly.  We literally use to come here twice a Week, but we haven't came for awhile due to my new work schedule.

Now that my work schedule is in order, we'll be back more often again.  The price are also super decent.  They have the tastiest Orange Chicken any Asian restaurant has ever served. Doesn't matter if it's Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Korean, etc. Literally the BEST Orange Chicken of any Asian restaurant.

Some of my other favorite dishes are:
Pad Se Ew, Spicy noodles, Well done Chicken Mint Leaves with added snow peas (must order this way to enjoy it best), beef noodle soup with the large flat noodles (must mention flat noodle), of course the Orange Chicken, Pork Fried rice with Chinese brocollis and Beef Panang.  For appetizers, they have the Best Fried Shrimps and vegetables. For desserts, their coconut ice cream with sticky rice.

Tips: They can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner, must be patience.

Quality: 5/5
Quantity: 5/5
Price: 5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Customer Service: 5/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hope the owner of this restaurant takes yelp reviews seriously. Good food. It poor service. Customers will not return with poor service<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to this plaza plenty of times. However, if my coworker had not recommended this place, I do not think I would have given it much notice. I've passed by numerous times and peered in, but it never occurred to me to think to eat here next. With that said. it was such a pleasant surprise to have enjoyed a filling meal here!

PARKING
Plenty of parking in the lot. Did not have a problem finding parking, but many spots are 30 minutes only.

INTERIOR/ EXTERIOR
The decor is not very fancy. The atmosphere felt very homey - relaxing with several people conversing quietly and many others eating alone. There are tables when you walk in, and several more booths toward the back. Restroom nice and clean!

FOOD
Silly to not get Pad Thai or Pad See Ew Noodles but there will be a next time! I got the Crispy Chow Mein which came in a pretty generous portion. It came with vegetables (corn, spinach, carrot, bamboo) and your choice of meat. The beef was nice and tender. The boyfriend tried the lunch special which we both weren't a fan of. He got the Kung Pao Chicken with Rice and it came with a small bowl of potato soup, a fried wonton, and an egg roll. We both loved the soup - feel warm and fuzzy inside! The chicken was moist and tender but lacking flavor.

SERVICE
The workers are all very nice! They check up on you every now and then, refill your water, ask if you need anything else. I noticed many people that drop by for lunch are regulars - they were addressed by their name and sit at their usual table. In a way, it feels like welcoming an old friend, and I really enjoy the comfort of that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Amidst a slew of white people food like Chipotle and Jimmy Johns, I'm glad to see some ethnic alternatives in the CSUF area. Thai Basil is the poor college students Thai restaurant. The service is okay, but everyone's too busy studying for midterms to care

I got the most basic meal, Pad Thai. It was okay. I doused it in chili and it got 1000x better. 

The interior is well decorated. Warm colors surround the rooms and cloth napkins. You KNOW a place is classy if they have cloth napkins. 

Overall, this place is where you would go if it was just there. No need to make any extra effort to drive out there, it's not worth it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've only been here a few times for lunch and it's just ok. They have a big selection of lunch specials under $10. The lunch specials all come with a soup, egg roll and fried wonton!! It's a good price for a hot lunch but not always happy with my order. 

Today service was lacking. We were seated and then left with our menus for a good 10 to 15 minutes with no one coming to get our drink order. Two other parties were sat after us and were served drinks and taken orders before we were. I had to get up and say something to a waitress. Once I told her something she was good but I was irritated. 

The favorites are the fried rice which comes with a meat or combo of meats, wonton soup with lots of delicious dumplings, egg rolls, fried wontons, the soup served with the special and the Thai Tea!! 

I've noticed that when you order an entree that has meat and veggies you get 90% veggies and 10% meat. This is something like broccoli beef or mushroom chicken, etc. flavor is alright and I like to have more meat than veggies!! It's not enough meat for the mound of rice you get.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">this review is strictly based on their food. ordered take out, got their spicy basil chicken. the meat is ground chicken, yet I found chicken bones galore throughout, and the whole dish was lacking in flavor. 

returned the food and got my money back, thankfully.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I absolutely love coming here on date night.

Food is served HOT, there never seems to be a wait time, and service is delivered often and with a smile. I've been here several times and haven't had a problem yet.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great little place for Thai food we have been here twice now and both times the service has been great, the food is fresh and delicious and the atmosphere is wonderful.  I also like that you can order online I placed an order one time and my food was hot and ready when I got there.  Prices are not bad for the quality of food that you get.  This will definitely be our go to Thai place from now on.  Everyone in there is friendly and willing to assist you and they care about their customers!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I took my twin 3 year boys to eat here for lunch this afternoon. The food was really good. I never ate this dish before. It was brown rice and very spicy chicken and veggies over it. The waitress asked me on a scale of 1 to 10 how spicy I wanted it. I told her an 8. Most of the time they never make it really spicy no matter what number you tell them. But this time, it was really spicy and I really liked it. I still prefer white over brown rice, but I wanted to try something different.

I only have 2 complaints. The rice was black rice not brown rice as they advertised on the menu. And the waitress had no personality at all. 

Just so you know. I used to have a company in Bangkok and my twins are half Thai, so we know what real Thai food is and are used to excellent service.

It's too bad because I would have given this place 5 stars if the waitress was nice. It is a shame how Thai people change when they come to the U.S.  :-(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! I was scouring yelp to find some good food I could take to class and have for dinner, and stumbled upon this gem! I ordered on Yelp, set a time to pick up my food and it was ready! I ordered the spring rolls which were divine! They came with the best peanut sauce I've ever had. I ordered chicken pad Thai which was a definite winner! So yummy! And then I ordered Pad Ke Mao to eat for dinner. It was good, a little on the oily side but very flavorful. I can't wait to eat here again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's been 6 yrs so I'll update my review.

I think the food still tastes the same which is delicious.

Prices have gone up about $1. Which isnt that bad considering they dont often raise their prices. As a measuring guide, veggie pad thai costs like $9.61 or something now.

Service is good but they arent many veteran employees. On Friday and Saturday nights they are busy and take out even has a long wait time.

But overall a great little place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place  is always wonderful.   Food service everything. Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good, solid Thai comfort food. Nothing special, but conveniently close to CSU Fullerton. Good sized portions. Never seen such customizable heat factor. Reasonable prices, lunch specials, and dinner specials available. Service is good. Lots of parking.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here quite a few times and it's a hit and miss depending what time you come. 

The first few times I've been, I had really great service and then the last time I went the service was really bad (maybe it was because it was busy).

The last time I came here it took about 15 minutes to be seated, which is fine, but then it took about 30 minutes before someone asked if we wanted drinks while a party on the next table were seated about 5 minutes after us and they had their drinks and were able to order and get their food before we even got drinks. 

I personally love their Dinner Specials (Lemon Chicken) They give you so much and it definitely hits the spot. 

But overall I think it's worth the wait and would come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't come, service is bad and portion is small.

</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai basil ladies you all work so hard and are so nice. The food here is so flavorful for a great price. Every item comes out perfect. I come here often and have never been let down. I've tried a couple Thai places and I'm sticking with Thai basil.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent quality food at a reasonable price with small servings.
I arrived at noon on a Monday and was immediately seated at a booth. The restaurant was clean and attractive and quiet. I was immediately asked for a beverage choice and handed a menu. Within five minutes I ordered beef Panang from the dinner menu with sticky rice. The owner told me that he could give me that choice as a lunch with two appetizers, rice and soup or salad. I chose to do this with the cucumber salad with a substitution of sticky rice for an additional amount. The salad was generous with cubes of cucumber and pieces of red pepper and red onion in a delightful vinegary sauce. The beef Panang was excellent but very small in portion. The appetizers were crispy and warm and delicious. The sticky rice was absolutely perfect. The tea was good but again a very small serving, however it was refilled 3 times. 
My waitress, Aree, was polite, quick, and attentive. Overall, it was a very good experience and one I will repeat. My total lunch price was $11.93 without the tip. My only recommendation would be anyone desiring a bigger food serving when ordering lunch buy from the dinner menu at that serving size and price.
I was finished with lunch by 12:40 PM.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the best Thai place in the Brea-Placentia-Fullerton area. I'm never disappointed when I go there. Pad kee mao, pad see eew, basil chilli beef, and the curries are always good. No frills and not pretending to be trendy or fancy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service was awesome. Food was delicious! I got the shrimp pad Thai and I am picky about pad Thai but it was really good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you want something different that's close to CSUF, this is where to go. I think it changed a lot from when it opened. Food is not as good as other Thai restaurants in OC. The crying tiger dish was bad. The meat was tough and the flavor was not at all as good. The current cook didnt put heart into his dishes. Mediocre.
The best Thai Restaurant is Thai Garden at Foothill Ranch. 
http://thaigardenoc.com<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place!! Whenever I'm in town this is the place to go. Great to dine in or can work perfectly well for takeout. I usually call and my order is ready in 10-15 minutes :)

*cough cough, they have lunch specials 

I would love to try a bit of everything, but I'm so basic I stick to pad thai :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'll keep it nice and simple. 

1. Server was extremely rude to us despite our kindness 

2. Server brought us our condiments and took it away for no reason without asking us 5 minutes later 

3. Pad kee mao, super bland; 2/5
 
4. Panang curry, it was horrendous; 0.87/5 

5. Pad See Ew was solid; 3.5/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Every time I come here, it seems like they are always busy...which means business is good. I just hate it that they are understaffed during the busiest times and therefore the service becomes slower than what it needs to be. The owner is super nice!!! She was very busy but she took the time to ask how my meal went and thanked me for stopping by. The waitress, however, was horrible. I don't have her name but I know that she's been working there for a while now because I've seen her before. But I guess what can you expect from a waitress who is not getting paid a lot for the work that she does...

On another note...try their Tom Yum soup! I love all the mushrooms that they put in it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Terrible service.  Seem either understaffed....or don't care about the costumer.  Had to get up and find a server to get refills.  Had to call a server to make or order.  Food was good, but never returning because service was do bad.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love THAI basil!!! Haven't been as often lately because we moved from fully to Anaheim but this is my go to when I'm near by or willing to make the drive for Thai food, I made it down today for the orange chicken and spicy pad keep mao-- so good!! 

This review is inspired by a lady I witnessed today being very rude to the servers, I peaked at the tab and she left very little tip while being so demanding; not good!. The servers here are very kind and patient, they deserve the best! 
Anyways; try the orange chicken/tofu and any of the noodle dishes, to die for!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place was recommended by a coworker since I'm not too familiar around the area of Fullerton.  It's surprising as I've worked here for 3 years but I haven't tried many places around here.  I ordered a few dishes directly from Yelp which is very convenient.  The food was ready by the time I had to pick it up which definitely saved me a lot of time.  

Ordered the pad see ew and the spicy fried rice with level 5 spice and it had a bit of kick to it.  There were lots of vegetables in the fried rice dish which was great.  My favorite of the dishes I had ordered was the Tom Yum Goong Soup.  The flavor of lemongrass was just the right of hot and sour.  I'm a huge fan.  The Massaman curry was a bit strong in flavor, they didn't include any extra rice for the dish to balance it out.  Overall, I did enjoy the meal and will definitely come back for the soups!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love their Pad Thai. 

One time I tried to call in an order and they left me on hold on the phone for 45 minutes......lol. So I just went to the shop and got an order. They don't have the best customer service but it's understandable when they're busy.

Sometimes they kind of sound rude when they talk to you but it's probably just their dialect. Food is pretty good but it could be cheaper. Or you know, add more food...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food and good service. Whenever I need my coconut curry fix this is my go to spot. I don't order anything else so I can't judge anything else on the menu but the Coconut Curry with duck is absolutely amazing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Bad service, bad food, bad toilets. I don't know what kind of conditions they are cooking under in the kitchen. I don't even want to know.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not impressed. I ordered pick-up of Yellow Curry Chicken level 8 spicy with BROWN rice and pot stickers. I get home and unpack the bag. 1st the pot stickers were still piping hot from my 6 minute drive home. So good sign... Until I dip it in the sauce and then take a bite. Bland... Didn't taste like much of anything. So next I go to the Yellow Curry Chicken. It's not even spicy at all! Then I look back in the bag and noticed that they gave me both chilie powder and chilie paste to put into the curry! WTH?! It needs to be cooked WITH the spices! Then I open the container for the brown rice. It wasn't brown rice! It was some sweet red bean rice concoction that didn't go with the curry AT ALL! Over-all... Total fail. Would not go back again. Expensive disappointment.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place the very clean and the waitress was very nice. 
The food is absolutely amazing!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've only have only come here during the lunch hours and it is packed. The service here is okay, effective, but thing to really rave about, gets the job done. During the rush hours the wait times can leave feeling disgruntled as you watch everyone else's hot steaming plates being served to tables around you. The food came out hot and fresh. We ordered the Padthai, Beef salad, the Beef Panang and with the some refreshing Thai Ice teas. The food was decent overall. I can't say it was the best Thai food I ever had nor is it the worst.

Pro:

-Decent food and decent prices
-Large selection of menu items 

Con:

-Busy during prime hours(lunch mostly)
-Parking near the front of the store is packed, you may have to park a little further out during prime hours

Overview:

All of the times I have eaten at this location was because I came here because of a good friend who loves this place. I suppose I'll keep on coming back to this place so as long as my friend and her husband continues to enjoy this place as well.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">MUST TRY THEIR HOUSE SAUCE SPRIMP & their egg drop soup. 
The shrimp is similar to the house lobster you'll order at a Chinese restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Spent Fathers Day for lunch with our daughter who has been eating here since she was a freshman at CSUF. 6 years ago,
Anyway nice place with an extensive menu. They also have a daily lunch menu with a lot of choices. 
We ordered the spring rolls with vegges, pad Thai with chicken, pad see ew, eggplant with tofu spicy #6 heat range, brown rice, and lemon chicken. All were prepared with fresh ingredients. 
Service was friendly and attentive!
We arrived at 11:30a and by noon all the tables were filled with several ppl were waiting for their to go orders.
Lots of free parking in front lot.
We will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has the BEST Thai food! All I can handle is a 7 or an 8 on the spicy 1-10 scale. They are as good as it gets!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yummy. When I'm in a rush and can't eat in although it's a great environment, I will call in and take it to go. They have great lunch specials decent dinner portion sizes and it all taste home-cooked<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered take-out here the other night and it was a pleasant experience. We ordered a lot of food and everything was pretty good and ready to go when we arrived. We especially liked the spicy eggplant and pad thai with chicken<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What a great Thais too visit. We were there last Friday with my friend just after 2days of my first visit. I love the parking specially around this area and the foods are so fresh. I will surely going back to the place with my parents. Love it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best Thai restaurant around me and the closest one.
This place is just an authentic Thai restaurant the foods amazing I always come here for the pad Thai or any of the noodle dishes and if I want it spicy hot. They can make it so hot that I'd be needing endless cups of water. 
The plate can fill 1 hungry person and or 2 people who just want to casually eat. The prices are reasonable for what your paying. 

Overall it's a good place for some real good Thai food<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is good. Portions are ok. Service however is extra slow, almost to a point of disrespect. Placing us(2) in a corner at the back of the restaurant when the restaurant is relatively quiet doesn't make sense. Then to get us water and our order 20 minutes after we are seated is unacceptable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have mixed feelings about this place: it's pretty good; however they always get my order wrong some way or another. About half of the time I come here I have to ask them to remake it - either because they don't listen, don't pay attention, or don't care - perhaps I will never know. 

Why do I come here, you ask? My husband prefers their curries to Thailandia. I think their curries are pretty comparable. Thai Basil can sometimes be creamier than Thailandia. But hey- everyone has different taste! I still remember one time they didn't cook the eggplant in my green curry. I sent it back and I'm certain they microwaved it. It was microwave lava hot. Also did not taste so great. So buyer beware - hit and miss.

As far as ambiance goes this place has more charm than Thailandia, but be warned, this place gets PACKED on weekends.

Points for solid Thai food and ambiance, minus points for inconsistency, frustration, and difficulty to get a seat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My husband and I have been eating at Thai Basil for many years now and it is still the best Thai food we've ever had. Our favorites are the Panang Curry with Beef and the Yellow curry with chicken. Our boys love the chicken Satay, Pad See Ew & Pad Thai. We will never tire of this place. You can't go wrong with whatever you order at Thai Basil.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been coming here for years and love everything I have tried so far. My usual orders are Tom Yum Chicken, Grilled Beef Salad, Chicken Satay, Fried Rice, Beef Panang. Friday and Saturday nights are usually crazy busy! Every time I'm there, sadly I always feel like the staff are being over worked; they always seem so stressed out and anxious with the overwhelming orders... I think that makes them lack customer service because being under staffed. I wish they would just have some extra help for the nights that are expected to busy. If you want to order to go, the wait is about 45 minutes from the time you call in till the time the food is actually ready to be paid for p/u (that was my experience on Friday night). 

If service is a little faster and a little more friendly, I would come even more often, like every week instead of every 3 weeks :) 

Overall, I still love the food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very bad food...
Ordered the chicken tom Kha, my favorite Thai dish, and it was by far the worst one I've ever had. Couldn't eat it... My fiancé ordered one as well and could not eat it either. The pad Thai was not good either, asked for spicy and was not spicy at all. The soup was VERY VERY SOUR, not like any m coconut soup I've ever had.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm super impressed...this place is my new favorite Thai restaurant in Orange County. Loved everything we ordered. My favorite is the chicken pan nang and their brown stir fried rice. The pad Thai noodles are on point. Portions are perfect for sharing.

The ambiance is nice and they definitely kept the place modern and clean. So far we have been there twice and each time the place is packed.

Servers are on it, refilling drinks and pre-bussing tables. Can't wait to try other menu items!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quick and friendly service! Food was super tasty, got the angry beef level 10 got my mouth on fire like wooooooooo. Hit the spot . Usually I order hot foods and have to add more to get that first burn I like but not here man good stuff.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Honestly,  I've had better. Used to go to a church in Fullerton, so it was kinda the go to Thai food place on a Sunday lunch time.  Used to think that it was pretty good, but after getting exposed to more Thai food restaurants elsewhere, now I think Thai Basil is just ok.  Last night, we ordered several dishes for pick up:  the Beef Pad See Yu (sp?), Tom Yum Shrimp, satay, yellow curry, Thai fried rice.  It was really nothing special, although I won't say that the food is bad.  It was nice that they gave extra sauce for us to have, but doesn't warrant a bump in stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was ok but the service was terrible. Terrible!! The waitress was so rude and they still charged a mandatory gratitude because we came in a group.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place!
The crying tiger, the pad thai, the omelette, the curry, and especially the yellow curry fried rice!
One thing about this place, the spicy level, is really a spicy level.
I usually get level 2 as it gets very hot sometimes!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't know much about authentic Thai cuisine.

However, I always order the pineapple and duck curry here, level 1 spiciness (I'm a wimp).

The rice is perfect. They always make perfect, white steamed jasmine rice. This may seem like a very minute detail, but it bumped up my rating of them from 4 stars to 5 stars. Rice matters. It has perfect texture. Perfect chewiness. Perfectly grained. I can't commend them enough for this.

Together with the duck & pineapple, it makes for a perfect lunch.

Their Thai ice tea is also pretty good, but I like that wherever.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't know much about Thai food, but I do know Thai Basil has great food. It's located in a plaza full of good food but it stands out among the few Thai places I've been to. 

I've had the Masaman curry on several occasions and I always love it (level 10 for the win). I've also tried the basic Thai dishes like Pad See Ew and Pad Thai and both have always been good. This place is really busy during dinner and unfortunately it's around that time that service starts to slack a little. 

There's a nice variety of drinks such as Thai tea or Thai iced coffee (highly recommended by the way) and several import and domestic beers. 

In short - good food, fair prices, busy dinners, BE PREPARED TO WAIT. Sometimes we were forgotten and couldn't even get a glass of water. Whether or not the long wait is worth it is up to you.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can't go wrong with Thai Basil. We always get Tom Yum Goong and Pad Thai and I'm never disappointed. Try their spicy peanut curry on rice for a nice appetizer. 

I have been here at least 5 times this year. Good Stuff. 
I'm impressed with how good the service is considering how busy this place gets around dinner.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I would go to this restaurant all the time!! (I don't live in California anymore :/ ). They have great lunch prices but also great for dinner! Their vegetarian egg rolls are by far the best! I love tofu so I would always order their sweet and sour tofu, and it can't be cooked much better!! I think it is an awesome place to try Thai food if it is your first time in the OC.

When they ask you how spicy, you really have to choose wisely because their spices are actually spicy!! There is never really a wait even though it is fairly popular! I love this place, definitely one of my favorite places to eat in the OC! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of my favorite places to go for Thai food, they have delicious fried rice and really good pad see ew. The only thing I hate about this place is the slow service, they only have like 1-2 waitresses and that rush hour it's worse. But other than that a really good restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Seriously best Thai food in town! They never fail to serve amazing and tasteful food. I have always received great and attentive service! I recommend trying the Shrimp and mushroom soup with glass noodles or the sweet and sour chicken Chinese style. Those are two of my favorite dishes but everything I have tried is extremely delicious! Try the fried rice too, it is always made so perfectly!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's been a couple of years now of ordering food from this place. We've only been to the restaurant for a few times as we have a dog and they do not have an outdoor area for our pooch, but ordering out was as good of an experience as eating in the restaurant, actually more convenient as we avoid the waiting. The food is always fresh and tasty, probably the best Thai food we've tried in OC so far.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We have eaten here often and love the service and food. We have also used them for catering large parties st our home. This is our daughters favourite restaurant and misses it now that she has moved away. If you like it hot and spicy and you're brave, order the spicy number 10, but no for the weak of heart<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place, I come in all the time with my boyfriend. Awesome Thai food and the service is great! I don't think the servers get the credit due to them during busy hours. They can be extremely busy at times yet they always handle their own. Thank you to the awesome servers of Thai Basil! :)
That being said...

I recommend the Massaman curry (if the idea of a peanut curry entices you) It's AWESOME! We were recommended it by the sweet lady server with the bob and glasses, she even took the time to explain the story of the Emperor who's recipe the dish is based on.

I also recommend the orange tofu if you are vegetarian or vegan (it's to die for!!) I'm not kidding, once you try it your life will never be the same... I've become a regular because of this dang tofu. Like a three times a week regular, it's THAT good.

The final dish I can't live without on a regular basis is the spicy pad kee maow (probably spelled wrong but you can sound it out proper lol). It's so tasty!! I typically go with a spice level of 6. 

All in all, I am thankful to have a place such as Thai Basil so close to my home, it's one of my favorite spots!! Also, their pick up and online service is amazing too :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This was a poor excuse for Thai food. I heard good things about this place, so I went and I was very disappointed. The food was subpar and it was too expensive for the small portions we received. I would never order here again. I tried to email them to complain but there is no way of contacting them besides phone. I did call and they BARELY spoke English so nothing was being resolved.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very very RUDE Waiter. We came in for lunch and the waiter showed bad attitude, raised his voice for whatever the reason was. We are not coming back and we made sure that management is aware of it.  Horrible experience with unacceptable customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This makes me really sad because this used to be one of my favorite Thai places in OC.. But today for lunch got the kung pao trio plate and there was no taste whatsoever... We were craving this place for so long.. Makes me sad. The service was ok, no utensils or napkins (had to ask) n the beef salad was good as usual, the app fried wontons meat portion was SO small.. Cleaned up fast but we were still sitting at the table talking, not the best when the dish cart is right by your ear.. Place isnt busy so its not like they need the table, but we will leave now... Disappointed<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3 1/2 stars... Whaaaaaaat?! Honestly, this place is seriously delicious!! I can't go longer than a few weeks w/out it. For me, this place never disappoints. Excellent food and friendly service!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This restaurant is super cute and the food here is delicious. I personally recommend the red Thai curry, spice level 6 with rice on the side. Really good!! Customer service was ok -- but could be better. Portion sizes were considered small to others, but they were perfect and we had leftovers!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">From the bottom of my heart i can state this is the best thai food i ever ate. Authentic. Same as in Thailand. Brought back lots of good memories.  Service was great. Owner and staff members are extremely friendly, patient and helpful to fulfill your order.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was ok, I wasn't blown away. The most tasteful was the pinapple tofu curry, the veggie chow mein and fried rice was nothing spectacular. The service was fairly slow and the waitress that took our order was incredibly rude. I will not return nor will I recommend that you eat here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this restaurant. Food is delicious and the lunch special is great. The two times I've gone service is fast and It's close to school. Definitely recommend it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food not only is the best thing at Thai Basil my families favorite place too eat. I lost $$$ there and you know they gave me back every penny. It was CASH. Do you know anyone so honest. I gave them a reward. Thank you again Thai Basil for the BEST food and being so so  honest. They found my money and gave it BACK...Sandra found the money.  Thank you again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not to pleased when the waitress gave my food to someone else in my party and he started to eat my meal the waitress looked at me as if i messed up. Expected me to order another plate and pay for HeR mistake. Make sure you pay close attention to your order because they'll being something you didn't order and make you pay for it. ie, they bring an appetizer that was suppose to go to another table and you say there starting at it for a few min they will leave it there and charge you for it even if you tell them you didn't order it. Poor customer service. Love Thai food but will bring business elsewhere.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After having been here a few times over the last few years, this place just doesnt stand out hardly at all to me. Some of the items are good some are meh. Nothing has been great and nothing has been terrible. That just isnt what I am after in the end. Average is not whats going to make me happy. 

The service is good. I like that they actually have a number of Thai servers unlike some places. On top of that they travel back and fourth from time to time. The service is definitely a big reason on why this place is as good as it is IMHO. 

Pro Tip: DO NOT SIT at the first four person table just past the counter inside of the doorway. The AC blows down directly on it and that AC is powerful! 

The grub has some things that are quite tasty and some things that are bland. This is not talking about spicy, its talking about flavor. So please keep that in mind. For example, the soup and eggroll with the lunch menu have almost no taste at all whereas the fried wonton was totally average. The pad see ew however had a good amount of taste. The garlic and pepper chicken is slightly different than I am used to. it was like one of the spices that they use for flavoring is different here. The massaman curry is pretty good.  Perhaps its different every time, I am not sure. Maybe its a chef. However, things just seem a bit inconsistent here.

Overall its a decent meal at a decent price with a decent  menu. However, its either hit and miss or its set up where some things are much better than others. I have absolutely no idea which is which.  To use the overplayed phrase, it is what it is. Its worth a stop, but its kinda like playing craps or roulette, who knows what you will end up with.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is amazing every time my family and I go .. It's always fresh. 
The service is quick and the place is very clean. They are open everyday. And
Best of all the prices are very good !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yayyyyy I just ordered and I cannot wait to eat! I just ordered the Orange chicken dinner. Comes with egg rolls, fried won tons, Salad and a drink. Bomb.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">For some God forsaken reason, I came back here against my better judgement. My husband was in the mood for Thai place and we just happened to be driving by this plaza, and I guess one of his co-workers had told him it's pretty good. But alas, once again - the food is a disappointment. The food isn't exactly authentic Thai food, compared to many of the other places I've been to. I usually like ordering spicy mint leaves at most Thai restaurants, but this place didn't even have anything close to that! The "closest" thing I could find was a fried rice with a bunch of vegetables...errr, not even close and not even the same thing!!!

On top of that, the prices are outrageous for Thai food ($9 for most meals plus $2 for a small cup of rice?!?!!!), the plaza this restaurant is located in is super ghetto, the restaurant itself is dirty (there were onions on our table when we first sat down and the plates were dirty), and WORST OF ALL... the customer service is HORRIBLE. I was injured when I came here and the waitress had the nerve to demandingly ask my husband what was wrong with me, since I was limping. Hmmmm, I should ask the same about her and about this whole restaurant! This same waitress also rolled her eyes and scoffed at us when we weren't ready to order our entrees yet, after my husband had already ordered an appetizer. Umm, okay?!?!! Seriously some of the RUDEST service I've ever been subjected to, but I won't allow history to repeat itself! Mark my words... I will NOT be returning EVER. This place is officially on my Yelp banned list - run away!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tonight I ordered the Spicy Salmon Filet dinner special.. 
I have to say I am very disappointed by the salmon-to-rice ratio. I got like 3/4 rice and 1/4 of a salmon filet 

The salmon was overcooked and drenched in a unpalatable sauce 

I paid ~$18 for this... however, my roommate says that they offer a lot of other good, reasonably priced options so maybe I will go back and give a follow-up review<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The orange chicken was great  I highly recommend it. THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE! My family hardly eat Thai food and the waitress was so rude and said THATS NOT HOW YOU ORDER!! Who does that? She would cut us off in the middle of our sentences. I felt like it was to the point that we were being discriminated against? I would give them 5 stars for their food however, their service was so horrible I would never want anybody to go through that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time here and i was not impressed. The pad Thai was dry and flavorless. The Thai tea was wayyyy too sweet.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A friend in OC and I were to have lunch together during the weekend. After debating where we should go, she took me to this Thai place. The restaurant looked tiny from outside, but it was spacious inside.  We were seated right away and the menu was brought to us. I looked at the menu and there were so many selections for lunch specials. All of them sounded delicious, so it took me a while to decide what I would have, but I finally decided to try Spicy fried brown rice w/ shrimp. 

A bowl of egg soup was brought to our table. Delicious! And my fried rice came right after I finished the soup. It was delicious and they generously put lots of shrimp and lots of veggies.  One small egg role and fried wonton also came with the rice. The egg role didn't have meat inside, but the wonton had chicken in it. I enjoyed the egg role since I don't eat meat. 

Service was good. Only thing was that the wait staff talked a lot and forgot to refill our water more than once. I know that it sounds picky but the rice was spicy and we needed water. They filled our glasses right after we asked for it. Thank you! The price was great too! I would love to try other dishes here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai food here awesome!! I lived in fullerton for almost 9 years and ive been here a few times every year! Delicious food and always busy. I would always do pick up because theirs never room tomeat inside<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A casual go-to place for small groups. Decent food, but too sweet for my liking. 

I like to get the green curry, but again, it's hit and miss with the sweetness. This is not my favorite Thai restaurant in the OC area. Food comes out pretty fast, so if you're looking for an average Thai place for a quick meal, this is the place for you.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The worst experience ! Bad attitude staff when the food is not even the best Thai in OC! Trust me<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yum! This place rocks. We've had thai a few places in Fullerton and this location was delicious. We got the chicken pad Thai which was pretty good, yellow curry which my wife loves and I got the summer rolls which I enjoy with shrimp every time. The atmosphere is great too, the dining room is clean.

In the past I've gotten:

Kung Lao trio-4/5
Orange chicken-3/5 (was good but really no chicken in it, mostly just breaking coated in sauce) 
Pineapple curry-5/5<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So disappointed. Came here on a sat night from San Francisco with family and we put our name down, something new since I was last here years ago. There was no one to tell us how long the wait was. We waited about 30 minutes and then when we asked how long, they said another 30-45 minutes for food. The 20-person party after us was their priority so we could not have the tables for 6. We had tickets already for a 9:30 pm movie so we ended up leaving. A few months later I came back and I find that the food is not as flavorful as it used to be and the portions aren't as generous either so I may go to another Thai place from now on.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been going here for years, mostly for work lunch. It has always been good food at decent prices. I like the #31 spicy chicken with mint leaves at about a 5 with steamed rice to sop up the leftovers with.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I won't be going here again anymore. 
I used to love eating here a ton but this recent visit I just had just ruined my experience. I was handed my pad thai(which was a small portion by the way, I finished it all and I usually can't) along with the bill totaling up to $18 something because my sister had ordered chicken satay. The chicken satay was small and the pad thai was a small portion. 
The food wasn't that great enough for me to want to come back anymore and the service was terrible. 
You disappointed me today Thai Basil. :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered lunch to-go for 16 people for my workplace and the food was ready when we arrived. Service was fast and friendly and the food was authentic and of good value. Apple helped us with our order and was patient and nice, there were no mistakes. I would recommend anyone craving Thai cuisine to this restaurant! I will definitely be coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here several times I never had a problem with service or the food I think this place is a really good Thai restaurant ,but I must say Thai Wave is absolutely fabulous check that place out you won't be disappointed!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My family and I have been coming here for about 10 years already and it's delicious! The food is great and so is the service. 
My favorites so far are the appetizer plate, the mushroom soup, beef salad, orange chicken, massaman curry, brown rice,  and the sticky rice with mango (when in season). I have yet to try other dishes but once I'm there I stick to my favorites, lol!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So good!
Whenever I'm near CSU Fullerton, this is my favorite spot for lunch. It can get crowded at peak times, but that's a good sign, right?
Spicy brown rice and pad kee mao (oh, the fresh basil!) are faves. So spicy, so delicious!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is exactly what you want when you are craving Thai food. Their fried rice is delicious. Service is quickly and friendly. I have been here for dinner and have also ordered take out. Both times I got a good portion of food for a good price.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lunch
Rad Na with Shrimp
Pad Ki Mao with Beef
Beef Satay
$27 before tip

The place is ok.  The rad na noodles were overcooked and broken up and the beef satay could have used more sear.  The standout was the pad ki mao which was flavorful and well cooked.  Service was ok and I had nothing to complain about in that area.

Next trip will be across the street to Thailandia.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've only eaten here to go a couple of times and I've only had the chicken fried rice. Every experience has been awesome, and the chicken fried rice is really good! The staff is super kind and friendly too and my food always comes out in under ten minutes. The portion for the fried rice is also pretty big- I'm surprised I can even finish it. Overall, I love it here and would definitely recommend it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Meh. Food wasn't the worst nor was it the best. We ordered papaya salad for our appetizer. This was decent, however a little kick on the spice level would have added to this dish. For our main course, we ordered pad see ew, spicy eggplant, pa nang curry & brown rice. 

Pad see ew: not flavorful at all, tasted way too bland
Panang curry: It was okay, there were too many chunks of tofu and not enough vegetables.
Spicy eggplant: A little too oily for my tastebuds

Food just didn't taste authentic enough. I used to love this place, but my recent trip back just didn't do it. However, service was fine, but this restart and does get crowded around 6:30-7, so try to come a little earlier!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We've been here several times for lunch and always enjoy it.  Today we had the chicken with mint leaves and curry chicken pineapple.  Both were wonderful.  I've seen in other reviews people have complained about the rude service.  We have NEVER had that experience here.  The servers were quite pleasant and attentive.  Our glasses of ice tea were refilled once they neared empty without asking.  I like that they ask how spicy you like the food.  Always a good lunch at a reasonable price.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the best pad Thai spot ever. I have been coming here for 3 years now and it never fails me by pleasing my appetite. Highly recommend this place<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is good but writer's attitude is horrible. She is really rude and mad at customers all the time<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's located in the same plaza as Office Depot and Panera. 
It gets pretty packed on Friday evenings so be prepared to wait and have slow service. Instead of them asking if we were ready to order we had to flag someone down (it's a pretty small restaurant btw) after about 15 minutes of being seated. There used to be the sweetest lady working there when I first started going the who made me want to go all the time, but I don't know what happened to her. And now the people working there are not the most welcoming except for a select few.
Their spring rolls are pretty good. It's filled with tons of fresh veggies. But something in them last night made them seem spicy. 
I do like that you can choose how spicy you want your curry on a 1-10 scale. 
They also serve a barbecue/grilled chicken with this really tasty honey? sauce.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Oh how this place brings back memories of my college days. Lived nearby, yet I practically always lived here! Used to be a regular here, in fact so much that I got to know the owner and her family. Super sweet lady! 

This was definitely my favorite and the best Thai restaurant in the city. Some of my all time favorites here include, the Thai beef salad, spicy shrimp fried rice and catfish curry. I can't believe it's been years since I've been here...I really owe a trip back the next time I'm in Cali!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This restaurant is the best for Thai food in town  for appetizer I recommend the beef salad and squid salad. For main dish, of course you can't go wrong with the pad Thai. And for dessert the sticky rice & mango is absolutely out of this world. But you gotta eat it during the mango season when the mango is sweet. You should ask the waitress and she'll tell you whether the mango for that day is good or not. They're very nice and helpful. Good service!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Would have received 5 stars if our server wasn't so unhappy and just walked passed past us when we tried to get her attention. Food is tasty. Shrimp fried rice is a little oily. Overall 4/5 stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">been here about a dozen times. Gotten good food a dozen times<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This restaurant was BUSY! When we went for lunch. The food was ok but the waitress was so busy she kinda forgot about our table. I would absolutely recommend this place though and will go back and try it at another time of day. The veggies were fresh and the spicy scale was great. Wish more places used it :) I had a 6 but would probably do an 8 next time :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Bleh. Not the best Thai place...Food was mediocre. Portions weren't that big. Lunch price is the same as the Thai place across the street (and they offer bigger portions).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Whenever I am in the mood for Thai food, I go here. I've tried several other Thai restaurants, but I just love the way they make their Pad Thai here. I like my Pad Thai noodles cooked thoroughly where they have color from all the flavor, and for the most part, this place does that. I don't like it when the noodles appear white which usually lacks flavor. Some days taste better than other days, but I guess that depends on the cook. Their Pad See Ew and Glass Noodle Salad are also very good. 

I've been coming here for over 5 years now, and I still love it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been going here with friends for a few years, and it's a pretty good spot. Service is reliable, and the food is plenty. Real affordable if you go during the lunch special. I'd recommend it, especially if you plan on getting the Pad Thai.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good thai food. My favourite is sphegatti noodles with green curry sauce and chicken saute. Staff will not talk good english, which makes irritated while placing take away order's.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">if this is what you call a restaurant, then i will never go to one ever again. they screwed up my order three times! what the eff is that. they gave me the wrong meal and they forgot to give me my thai tea and they charged me all that anyway.  i paid twenty dollars for some dry ass beef and salty sauce. the waitress kept giving me attitude and had the nerve to ask for tip. wtf. dont come here. this place is trash.<p>

- Tofu Pad Thai
- Beef Salad

Tina's Tips and Tantrums
- Cousin prepaid before and they had it ready for pick up. Staff was super friendly, making jokes and all.
- $30-35 per tray
- Everything was presented nicely 
- Skewers were on point, very juicy with the peanut sauce and the cucumber sauce (I don't know what it was made of, but it was tasty)
- Pineapple fried rice, no bueno and also because I'm not a big fan of pineapple
- Pad Thai was alright, tofu was soft, but rather oily
- Beef Salad was delicious! Best thing out of the four dishes, but of course the pad thai was more filling.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is probably my favorite restaurant! I love the "chow mien with shrimp" and I also love the "Thai tea !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fabulous flavors, excellent service, great for take out!  Thai Basil continues to be requested by visiting out of state/town family members.   In fact one morning I caught a house guest sneaking into the refrigerator to Bogart the leftovers.   We love the brown rice, Chinese broccoli, chicken curry among other favorites.  Having been a customer for +-10 years I will admit, I've called the manager/owner at least twice in a panic when a dish/flavor/quality is off.  She is always so appreciative of the feedback, and by our next visit the food is back to being absolutely delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was looking for a quick, tasty bite off campus and this was among the dozen or so restaurants listed. I love Thai, and more often than not these spots have great lunch specials. 

The place wasn't too packed, even during lunch time, and I got a seat quickly. The first thing to jump out at me from the menu was chicken with cashew nuts, served over brown rice. Simple, full of good stuff. Can't go wrong, right?

When the dish arrived it looked great, but there was a faint smell of burning oil. When I took a bite, my suspicions were confirmed - it tasted like burned oil. I don't know how this kind of thing happens. I'm no chef. It did effectively kill any interest I had in finishing my plate. I did, however, still eat it because I was hungry and didn't want to screw around with going elsewhere or getting something else. The flavor was shot, though. Considering the ubiquity of Thai places, I'd say the odds of a return visit are slim.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We had take out spring rolls from Thai Basil today, and loved them! The only thing I would do differently is call ahead to save time. 

Thai's menu says it prides itself on making everything fresh ... isn't most Thai cuisine done that way?, and our 4 spring rolls ($30) were a great example of that approach. Crunchy where it's supposed to be, and tender likewise in the right places. Flavor is on the light side, but freshness and hand crafting trumps that solitary negative.

Not being Thai myself, I asked the lovely staff what menu items are best for hands and take out, and sadly I was given a menu. I wonder if I had ordered Pad See Ew would she have said anything.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always delicious! Only thing to make it better would be if they delivered.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Super awesome thai food. Spicy eggplant chicken, pad thai, chicken fried rice are a must have!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered deep fried fish cakes, pad see ew, pad thai and Thai coffee. 

Deep fried fish cake ($6.95): kinda spicy but not too tasty.  

Pad see ew ($7.95): very greasy and kinda bland.
Pad thai ($7.95): better than pad see ew.

Thai coffee: not strong and borderline tasteless.

Friendly service but it's hard getting their attention.

2.5 stars!!

Thai Basil is not yummylicious!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3.5 reviews?
PEOPLE ARE CRAZY!!!!
This little gem is the best Thai place in Fullerton. If you don't believe me, try the Duck Curry. Not only is the food delicious and healthy, it costs like $9 for a lunch combo that comes with rice/an eggroll/a crunchy thing/your entree. This totally sh!tts on a combo you would get at McDonalds that is like $8<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the food, but the service needs to improve.  They brought our orders out of order and the rice we ordered, still never came after all of our meals were brought, so we had to cancel the rice since we were practically finish.  I still would come back because I love the food but if you service can get a little better in bringing the food in order, would be great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Thai food and I'n not hard to please. This place, however, was mediocre at best. Food was barely average, and one of the servers was clearly having a bad day and went out of her way to let us know. I'm familiar with old school Asian servers and their "not so friendly attitude". This woman, however,  went off the chart. I don't think I will ever go back to this place. Tom yum soup was bland and didn't have enough substance. It was mainly broth.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My first time having Thai food and I loved all three dishes I ate. I thought the pricing was reasonable and the food presentation was on point! The staff was very friendly and genuine. There is a lot of seating in here and the environment was nice. Great food, I can't wait to come back and try some more! I'm a fan of this place<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wonderful lunch specials and attentive service workers. I've come here the past four years and I've never left not enjoying my food. Word to the wise - portions are large so split with your friends!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my favorite Thai restaurant.  I eat here at least once a month and get carry out every week for my aging father.  
My favorites are the green curry with tofu and I prefer extra veggies. Their brown rice is amazing and has a nutty flavor.  
I also like the peanut sauce dish served with broccoli.  
I dined with my  son today and he had the pad Thai- he said it was the best he has ever had.  
Their spring rolls are really fresh. 
My father always gets the Panang chicken. 
He loves it. 
All the waiters and waitresses are helpful and efficient. I suggest dining here - Good prices - great food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and very accommodating to veganism. I almost always get the Basil Delight with tofu, it's spicy and flavorful, and the portion size is good. I definitely recommend it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Super unimpressed by Thai Basil. Everything we ordered was bland. We were disappointed by the food and lack of flavor or spice. They were very fast with their service and offered frequent refills though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai food is one of my favorite cousins. I have tried so many thai restaurants but Thai Basil is the best one so far. Food is fresh and tasty.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai Basil has the freshest and most flavorful Thai food. We are regular customers and always have a good meal here. Serving staff is friendly and attentive. The owner is a gracious host. They accommodate vegetarian/vegan requests. During peak hours service can be a little slower, but it's definitely worth the wait.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My boyfriend and I have dropped by here several times, and I have to admit that it never disappoints us any time. This time, we ordered the rice noodle with duck meat and a dinner combo with beef curry with pineapple. The rice noodle with duck meat was so delish. The rice noodle was exactly like Pho, and the flavor of duck was pretty strong, and duck was chewy too. A dinner combo includes 2 egg rolls, 2 pot stickers, 1 small bowl of soup, 1 drink, curry and brown rice. The beef curry with pineapple we ordered has the spicy level od 5. I thought it would be medium, but it turneed out pretty hot. It's fine for me, but for someone who can't eat spicy food like my boyfriend, you should order less spicy. The curry tasted decent too. In general, it lived up to our expectation and it was not too pricy as we paid about $28 in total with tips.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quality has gone down. I checked out Thailandia across the way and I enjoyed it over Thai basil.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been here many times.  Food is good, prices average for portion size but service could be better.  Seems routinely understaffed and often slow to serve.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their pad thai is good; I've certainly had better but I also can't complain much about it. Their pad kee mao is good as well - I love that they have a scale of 1 to 10 for spiciness level. If you like spicy, it really adds to the taste :) I've also tried their spicy fried rice; tasted like standard fried rice. It made for a good meal and great leftovers the next day since the portion is pretty big. The waitresses are very nice. For now I give this place a good 3 stars - leaning more towards the "hm, pretty good, I'll come again" rather than the "meh, it's alright."  My school has had catering from Thai Basil before, and the food was amazing, so I feel I must return again and try some other dishes in order to make a really solid judgement about this place. So...to be continued!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went here for dinner on a Friday night around 7 PM and it was pretty packed. My friend and I took the last available booth. I got the panang curry and my friend got the shrimp pad thai since he couldn't eat meat for lent. My chicken curry was decent, the curry portion was a bit small and  I had a lot more rice left over towards the end. My friend's pad thai looked really yummy but I noticed it was missing lemon (which I always seem with other restaurant's pad thai dishes). The staff was very attentive and the friendly guy serving us kept joking with us. They do take card and the total came out to around $25/2 people.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was in thai basil tonight.... And had such a horrible experience!!! Next time you go order your beef panang without plastic. Have to be honest we didn't have to pay for dinner but we left the whole thing there. Such a bad experience, went outside the parking lot puking because of how it felt when I chewed on it. Thinking it was a piece of bone or something, seriously have never had beef panang like that! I felt like a piece of glass stabbed me  in the roof of my mouth. Goodness.... I can't believe it. What a great Christmas dinner ( yeah right ) and the waitress thought that we put the chunks of plastic in there until they checked their kitchen and one of their containers was chipped they said. Be careful!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Let me sum this place up in three words: slow, tasteless, small (as in portion size). I normally like family owned businesses, but even the charming family grandma could not help this struggling restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm stunned that Yelp gave this place 3.5 stars. This was the worst Thai food I can remember. We ordered four entrees and the best was mediocre. Service was slow and generally bad as well. Such a bummer for our Saturday night!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not really a fan of Thai food because of a bad shrimp experience. But this restaurant is leagues better. Order yellow curry dishes!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went their w/ my friends
They recommend  me so strongly 2 try Thai food rite here
I tried fried rice, pad see yu, and Tom yang Kung
Its awe some 
This makes me open 2 eat Thai food<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Customer service the worst i experienced till now. Came in they took the order and gave our food. Next thing i noticed was they brought the checkout with the food as if i was not going to pay for the food i ate. No one came and stop by to ask for water or asked if i needed anything more. And then they expect tip for their worst service. Wont recommend nyonet to visit this spot. I sat at table B12 time 13:12 dated  July 19 2015.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was in the area, so based on some of the reviews I decided to try this place. Was not greeted very promptly, but the place was fairly steady. The Tom Yum soup was watery and lacked substance. As for the Pad Thai, not bad really but I have had better. The service levels were also marginal. The bottom line is that I have had much better Thai food elsewhere. Not sure if I would return, but "perhaps" if I was in the vicinity again. Then again, I may just pass it by......<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food here was off tasting. One of the worst pad see ew I have ever eaten. Everything was too sweet and the greens in the dish were quite bitter--not your usual Chinese broccoli or American broccoli even. I have no idea what the greens were. Sparse quantity of meat, too. Wasn't feeling the food even with added chili and soy sauce. I couldn't finish my food and ended up really thirsty, too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious!!! I love this place. The friendliness of the servers is hit or miss but they are always fast.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've eaten here four times now so it's time for a review. 

I'm very impressed with everything I've had here. The place is very clean and the staff is friendly. When they are not super-friendly it's because they are a popular and busy restaurant that is trying to take care of business. Thai Basil is great for vegetarians and carnivores alike. 

Let's get onto the food, shall we?

Everything I've had here has been excellent. I've been to Thailand and I always tell people that most Thai food you get here in the U.S. is maybe 90% as good as in Thailand itself. Tahi Basil is an exception to that rule. Their food is better!

Helpful ordering information : just tell them how spicy you want your food and that's what you will get. I really appreciate that because I'm the kind of guy that likes it spicy, but not so much you can't taste the food anymore. Nobody's trying to be a here, right? 

They have a very big menu so I'll be going back again and again to conquer it. I've had Tom Yum Gai soup whichis chicken, mushrooms with lemongrass. It was very fulfilling to have something that was well prepared, delicious and satisfying. 

I've also had the egg rolls which were truly, deep fried to perfection. 

The Pad Thai was great and survived the ride home without becoming soggy. Really flavorful and I know, I know, everybody gets Pad Thai. Well, this is a really good one. 

One item they could have been a little more careful in their preparation was the Satay Chicken. They were almost overcooked but not murdered yet not juicy like I would have hoped. I believe they make their own peanut sauce and that was really flavorful and unlike others I've had. 

I'm not sure if this is on the menu but one of the waitresses suggest I try the duck, crispy fried with garlic and some kind of chili. This was a real winner and not exactly on the menu. What I had was chopped up in bite sized pieces, perfectly cooked, not greasy and a pleasure to devour. 

Lastly, I've had the yellow curry. It was definitely a cut above the usual yellow curry we are all used to eating. More flavorful, fresher vegetables and, my favorite, served hot. 

This place is a winner!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has good lunch specials but the food is always on the oily side. I'm rather drive to Rowland Heights and get better Thai food there. This place is meh...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Horrible service! From the moment I walked in the door with my friend they didn't even acknowledge us. The waitress set up a booth and we assumed it was for us yet when she finally made eye-contact she asked where we'd like to sit. She made an "oh you want to sit there" comment as we made our way to the booth. 

The food was "okay" to say the least. Between the horrible service and mediocre food this is definitely not on my list to return to. 

Don't waste your time. Go elsewhere.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Some of the blandest Thai food I've ever had in my life. OC must be lacking! 2012 Best Thai Restaurant in OC??? You've got to be kidding me.
I had to throw Sriracha on. I don't think I've ever had pad thai so tasteless.

They must also have a small kitchen because when I ordered for takeout, I was quoted an hour. I show up an hour later and I STILL had to wait another 15 minutes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is always good. Can get busy in the evenings, especially towards the end of the week. I use Thai Basil as a standard of measurement when dining on Thai food elsewhere. 
Stir fried glass noodles is the bomb. The pad thai is wonderful as is the pad see ew. Haven't had a bad dish yet.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Over the top Thai food and service.  We have been there several times and each and every times it's tasty and worth it! Price is right on point.  The owner Edith is awesome and the food is perfect.  Everything you would expect!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Let me start by saying this is review for the extremely bad service we received at this place. The food here is good and we have been here several times but of late some of the new waitresses treat you like they don't want you back. Maybe it's an Asian thing but take out service has also gotten bad. I was put on hold for 25 mins and someone just hung up before asking what my order was.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Me and my boyfriend used to come to this place EVERY SINGLE DAY. I mean, we went faithfully. Sometimes we even went TWICE a day. I spend ALOT of money at this place. I really do. The customer service should be way better, being that they have good food. They've risen prices, maybe because they're not making as much money as before. Again, because of the customer service. If they would FOCUS on the customer service, and less on the money aspect, I'm pretty sure loyal customers like me would stay.

The last two times I went, I found a hair in my food. The first time, I let it slide just because it was late, I was tired, and they were almost closing. But today, after I found a hair AGAIN, and they wanted to charge me for a new one I said nope, I'm done. Not to mention they charge 50 cents extra for more onions, and $1 for a little bit more peanuts in the Massaman curry.

They charge for almost everything extra. Meat is understandable. But extra onions or tomatoes isn't . It's not like they even give you big portions? Yet, they have customers because the food is good. If it wasn't for that, this restaurant would go out of business.. 

With the customer service they have (which is common in most Asian restaurants), definitely will never expand outside of Fullerton. ..  I was disgusted tonight, I could've expanded the situation, but I didn't. 

So, sad to say, I have to find another Thai restaurant or go to Thailandia across the street from now on.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place was really good.  A lot of local business types pulled in for lunch at the same time as we did, we had been driving for 5 hours straight and were ho and sweaty and ripe, but all were friendly and the food was quick to our table.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After trying a few Thai places in Fullerton, Thai Basil would be my top choice locally. Their ingredients are fresh, they offer dishes that are traditionally present on menus at other Thai restaurants, as well as other house-dishes that are not commonly available. But in comparison to Thai restaurants elsewhere - specifically SF and LA, it doesn't quite match up. I've tried a few dishes: 

Pineapple Fried Rice + Chicken - good flavor with generous amounts of chicken.
Pad Kee Mao + Beef - went with medium spicy and it was the perfect spicy for me, noodles weren't too oily, seasoning was spot on, and the vegetables were delicious. 
Green Curry + Pork - curry had a good flavor but a lot more liquid-y than I would prefer.

The ladies that work here are all very kind and accommodating. I would definitely recommend Thai Basil for anyone craving Thai food in the Fullerton area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place service sucks. I was there with a few friends and one of them had some dietary restrictions. They spent 10 min getting the order making sure they understand the order and then brought wrong food. Once we told them that they gave us non vegetarian food when we ordered vegetarian she said you didn't mention that.  after explaining it to one person she brought another person to go over the order again. We got tired and we said we are going leave and they didn't even apologize. We left from them I would not recommend this place. I even tried this place before and got sick a couple of times<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place gets a three because their food is pretty amazing, but the service is an absolute joke. I've been coming here for a while and recently, in the last two or so years, I've noticed the service going down drastically. The servers seem like they don't want to be bothered, therefore responding very abruptly and rudely if you have a question or want to order. My boyfriend and I came here one evening and we were like ghosts in this place!!!!! They didn't give us our water until 20 minutes later and they were taking orders from guests around us who came in maybe 15 or 20 minutes after us. If you want to order from here I suggest a TO-GO order. It takes forever for someone to get to you and they aren't apologetic at all about it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite Thai food place! 

We found Thai Basil when our usual Thai food restaurant changed hands and the food quality took a dive. We have eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants, both locally and while on vacation, and Thai Basil remains my favorite. The food is always, consistently good. Super friendly staff. Everything is always clean. It gets crowded, but they've always managed to seat us quickly.

Food suggestions:

Fried tofu appetizer
Tom Kha Gai soup - we get ours with tofu instead of chicken
Chicken sa-tay
Any of the pad thai noodle dishes
Green curry
Eggplant tofu with mint
Red rice<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place. All the times I have gone there's never been a wait. The food is amazing and fairly priced. The only thing I don't appreciate is that one of the waitresses is very pushy. She brings out the check way before we finish eating and just seems like she wants us to leave. Otherwise staff is friendly:)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food here is decent, I've had better Thai else where. I'm very picky about my food, and this Thai just did not taste as authentic and as delicious as I've had before.

The customer service isn't great. I feel rushed every time I'm eating since they drop off the check almost immediately, and hardly ever pay attention to you. The first time I went was better than the last time. Not once was I offered a refill on my water, I had to wave down who I thought my waitress was.
The workers were all standing by the register just talking not paying attention to their customer.

Needless to say don't think I'll be returning in a while.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't have anything bad to say about this place.  It's AMAZING!  Great authentic Thai food and fast and friendly service. I haven't had anything that I didn't love so far and I've been going to this restaurant for 10+ years! My favorites are the green curry, pa nang curry,  pad see ew, pad thai, and orange chicken.

Looking at some of the other reviews I'm really surprised to see complaints about the service and the food.  I've never had a bad experience there, ever.  They are always friendly and efficient and the food is always delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We stopped by on our way home to San Diego.  As we were waiting, we witnessed a young lady in a black apron bring out food to each table or person picking up take out with a big smile and was very courteous.      First time here...wasn't sure if the food would be good but as we sat waiting for food and see the crowd dissipate and then quickly increase we knew this was the right choice.  Being from San Diego, we have eaten at many Thai eateries.  We were excited when our food came.  The food here was fresh, colors bright and clear, the melding of flavors was exciting, and was very tasty.  The fried sole over mango salad entree was amazing... As was the pad seew...and Mongolian beef.  Don't let the wait deter you...it was definitely worth the wait.  Thank you to the staff and the young lady in the black apron....manager or owner?...think so the way she cared for her customers with her personal touch of delivering the first food to come to your table.  Thank you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really enjoy eating here, it's comfy and it's the type of Thai food I like! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I absolutely LOVE this place. At first, I will admit, it seemed the servers were too busy for us. After a couple visits, they starting joking with us. And now, they all know us by name.
The spicy noodle here is they best I've had. Noodles are nice and caramelized, and you get to choose your spice level from 1-10 (warning, the 10 does make me cry, and I have a pretty high tolerance). Tom Yum, Tom Ka, Crying Tiger, Eggplant Beef, I highly recommend all of them. I've taken large parties here as well and they've been very accommodating.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not to "Thai" for.

My friends and I decided to cheat on our usual trip to Thai BBQ in Fullerton to check this place out.  In terms of decor and presentation, this place is much nicer.  Cloth napkins at dinner time and an actual page-turn menu, it's date location approved.

Now, I don't want to keep comparing with Thai BBQ, but I must.  Given that both locations do not have the BEST Thai food, Fullerton is a small town -- you need to know the competition.

The food overall seemed bland to me.  It lacked the flavor intensities I wanted whether it was spiciness, saltiness, or sweet.  Perhaps that means it's healthier here?  Don't quote me on that... I'm not sure that lack of flavors equates healthy food.

I ordered their beef pad see ew.  Friends at the table ordered spicy shrimp fried rice, pad thai, green curry = mediocre all around.

This place wasn't good enough for me to cheat on Thai BBQ.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love that it's right next to CSUF. Sometimes they can tell my bf and I are rushing back to class so they serve us very quickly to help us get out in time. Food is great in my opinion. My favorite and usual dish is the pad Thai. There's a particular flavor to it that has a hint of a sweet taste. It's well made and fresh and hot from the time I get it to when I finish it. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because for the price (including lunch hour price) I wish the portions were just a little bigger. I usually order pad Thai with extra noodle. Other than that, I love the atmosphere. Inside the restaurant there's a nice sophisticated and fancy restaurant feel without the killer prices of an actual fancy restaurant. This restaurant will be my life until I graduate from CSUF<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Schmehhh... I've had better. sadly this spot is sub par and hardly qualifies as food. too harsh? Welp, I won't be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">She almost yelled at me... They r too busy during the lunch time, so it's not a good time to come here to order something Togo.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best orange chicken in Fullerton. Perfect place to eat after a Hall & Oates concert. I recommend the beef salad.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Honestly this is a 1.5 star review. Very unauthentic, flavorless Thai food. The flavor profile was closer to Chinese then Thai. The Thai lemon grass soup with shrimp had green onion in it and it threw the whole flavor off. Also, TMI, but it gave my girlfriend and I the runs. There are definitely better places with great flavor b<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my go-to Thai place in Fullerton. Surprised at some of the one star reviews, particularly the one about cleanliness. I have always been satisfied with the cleanliness at Thai Basil & the promptness of the service. The staff moves quickly  & that does translate to rushed customer service but the food makes up for it.
The Pad Thai & Pad See Ew are my favorites!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been dining at Thai Basil for years, it is still one of my favorite restaurants. I am in love with their brown rice (always cooked perfectly) and green curry. I have tried a few things on the menu but I have to get my favorite dish! The service is consistently not good however the food definitely makes up for it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has the best coconut soup. The orange chicken has an amazing taste and everything is made once it's ordered. I come here at least 2x a week. The only bad thing is that the service is not that great they look confuse, this is the only bad thing. Don't take bad credit for that because the food is amazing so far best Thai food I have tasted!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My go to Thai restaurant when I went to CSUF. Shrimp fried rice and mango fish = bomb<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Best Fried Rice on this side. Reminds me of street hawker fried rice. Definitely will go back to try other offerings. Service was a little slow cuz they were quite busy for Thursday.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Thai Basil for a lot of reasons.  The food is served up fast, it's fairly priced and it's good. 

Having travelled Thailand three different times I've had my share of good Thai; bad Thai too.  In fact, the worst Thai meal I ever had was in Thailand, when they made the food in a way they thought an American would like it.  Awful.

Truth is, Thai food varies depending on which part of the country you are in. Some areas are more spicy and colorful, others not so much. Given the variance there, it makes sense there would be different sensibilities here, too.

Thai Basil falls on the more flavorful and colorful side of the palate. Choosing your spice level from zero to ten, ten being spiciest, is a nice option. I love getting a sweat from the spice, and seven usually gets it done.  A better option is letting them prepare it the way they think its best.  

Edith, the owner, knows her stuff, as does the chef and staff.  It's often very crowded but the wait  never too long.  Things move quickly.  Lunch deals are great, too, though Cal State is only blocks away and a lot of faculty and staff head there for lunch. 

Thai Basil is my favorite Thai food locally. The spicy brown rice with vegetables, level six or seven, is my favorite.  But try whatever looks good on the menu, there's a lot to choose from. Great stuff.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would give more stars if I could. I have tried several things I the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The salmon with chili, garlic and pepper is a must try! Staff is friendly. My only complaint is that they are always busy which is a good sign of great food. Love this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Spring roll: Awesome, Fried Woton: coukd of been better. Pad Thai: delicious! Sticky rice and Mango: best desert ever!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's was Friday evening. First and last for us.  I agreed the customer Services are horrible.  They don't seem to welcome or smile at you to be seated. Then we wait for a long time to get the soup (30min-40min).  Then we wait for another 30 min to get out rice then 20 more min to get our larbs which taste nothing like it. Then we finally got our last dish.  We ordered mild on the soup and it came very spicy.  There aren't that many people but man it's like time stop machine in there.  Never again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not the best service.   Never refilled our drinks without us asking. The ac was turned up high even though it was already cold outside. They don't take your name you have to sign yourself in.  The food was good but I would never want to eat In the restaurant again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best Thai food around! Last time I was there though, our server was EXTREMELY rude. She was an older lady, pretty much the oldest I saw. It's a shame that her bad attitude, eye rolling and no patience ruined our dining experience. Next time I'll just make sure we're not placed in her zone. The foods to awesome to not go back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sorry Thai Basil. You're not the only place around and this visit was very disappointing. I came for the lunch special and yes it was near the end of the lunch hours, but I was here and seated before 3pm. I was even given the lunch menu! I pointed to the item on the lunch menu and confirmed with the server we were ordering lunch specials. Mind you this took some time because she didn't seem to understand we wanted rice with our meal. I found that odd because lunch specials come with rice. Pretty sure she assumed we were doing straight entrees. So that took a few moments to get straightened out.  Like I said we were pointing directly to what we were ordering on the menu so why it was confusing was beyond me. When we received our entree I noticed we hadn't received soup and salad. So I flagged down a server and asked about it. She said,"That's only before 3pm." I replied. "I know. We were here and seated before 3pm." She disappears for a few comes back and says we ran out of soup do you want a cucumber salad?" How do you run out of soup. Who knows maybe they did, but at this point I have a hard time believing it because the entire visit has been like pulling teeth. We don't like cucumbers so that was not gonna work and we weren't offered anything else. So I paid for food we didn't actually get. As for the food itself. It was ok. Nothing spectacular and the portions were meh. Too pricey for what we actually received. I don't see myself coming back here. There are other establishments much better for the money and with better service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They are very vegan friendly and the the food there is delicious! I recommend getting the tofu spring rolls with the peanut sauce and the orange tofu with brown rice. Plus they have pretty good specials for lunch and a decently priced one for dinner that includes wine!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i wont go back. I ordered 3 different things ( noodles, rice and soup) , all three were VERY bland. I took the leftovers home hoping my husband might be able to make it taste better ( He's a cook ). very disappointed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food Is good, depends what you order.
There pad see ew is ok but everything else is good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is the best restaraunt in Orange County, and that's no exaggeration! The food is amazing and the price is fair, the atmosphere compelling and the service exceptional.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I personally recommend:

Beef salad $8.95

Tons of flavor. You can choose your spice level. I usually get 4 or 5. 6 and above can get REALLY spicy. Actual steak strips on top of a spicy/sour dressing with cucumbers, lettuce, red and green onions. If you order this as take out, ask them to put it in a separate bag. One time, they put it in the same bag with a hot entree and the salad ended up being warm by the time I got home. I hate warm salad. The only downside is that it's close to 8-9 bucks. 

 I didn't like their version of Mongolian Beef though.

If you do come here, can't go wrong with the usual dishes like pad thai, pad see ew, satay and the tom yum soup.


My group and I had a disappointing incident when I came last time. Never came back since. 

To make a long story short, we were seated in a booth near the restrooms and throughout our stay, there was this waiter who gave us a bad attitude.  His voice was stern and body language was evident that we didn't want to serve us. However, the booth next to us, his voice dramatically changed as if he were reading a Winnie the Pooh story to Kindergartners. I was amazed by this dramatic transformation. He asked if they needed anything else, etc. 

It's a shame because the service was a disappointment (to us at least) and it seems like their portions shrank over the years, but the food was superb.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food very late, missed a dish, when food arrived brought the wrong dish. Hated the place and the cocky waitresses. Never going back again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite Thai place in the area!

I prefer to order take out because it tends to be a longer wait than I would like if you sit down and wait there, but either way the food is great. Service isn't the best, but I really don't care about that when I just want some quality Pad Thai.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has good flavor they ask you how spicy you want Oma scale to 1-10 ok service but overall it was pretty good food I would come back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My new fave thai food spot! The food at Thai Basil is delicious, the service is fantastic, & the restaurant is both neat & cute. The Pad Thai, Chicken Fried Rice, Papaya Salad, & Tom Yum Goong Soup are all amazing.  I've been here three times and will definitely come back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Firstly I have to write that I've never been to Thai Land so I have no way of knowing what traditional Thai food tastes like.  I will say I've had lots of different local places for thai food and this one is a solid thai restaurant.  

Ordered fried wontons, beef pad thai, yellow curry with potatoes and onions with chicken, and fried rice with pork.  (although they put beef instead of pork).  That didn't bother me at all.  

Fried wontons were a great started.  If you want something crunchy with a good sauce this is where its at. 


Pad thai is delicious, we did a spicy level 5, I could have done an 8 if I was the only one eating it.  So good though!   Not greasy, lots of flavor, slight sweetness with a savory flavor.  

Yellow curry with chicken was fantastic.  The curry was delicious.  Tons of flavor with a great consistency.  Not to mention the portion was just enough for 3.  

Fried rice was also fantastic.  Lots of flavor and not greasy like I've had in past restaurants.  

Overall, this place is great.  It gets busy so don't be afraid to wait 20 minutes for a table.  Its worth the wait.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The veggie pad Thai here is something that, once I crave it, I will not stop thinking about it until I get it! It's by far one of my favorite Thai places to go to and the portions are huge for a great price. Only thing is, it's usually always busy and there's usually a wait, so I would suggest calling ahead to place your order. If you're eating there, the service is still super quick once you get a table regardless of how busy they are.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I tried this place after many trips to Thailandia across the street.  Had heard many good things, so thought I'd give it a try.  Nice restaurant, good service,  nothing to complain about at all,  but overall the food does not compare with Thailandia in my opinion, so I probably would not return because of that.   But I would recommend giving it a try to see if it's your cup of tea!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A local favorite for tasty thai food. Food always taste fresh and tables are usually full!  Have never been disappointed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food, service is always quick.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is ok at best, nothing spectacular. The restaurant is clean and classy, and the people are friendly. Portion sizes are great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was craving Thai food, but didn't want to stray too far away from CSUF...I've already been to Thai-Rama BBQ and I did not like it at all so Thai Basil it was! Came in around 4? and there was only 1 other table besides ours. We sat down and they totally forgot to give us a menu so we had to ask them and they apologized, but really it's not that big of a deal.

What we got:
Chicken Pad Thai ($7): it's so hard for me to try something different at a Thai place because I love pad thai wayyy toooo much! I was impressed with how it tasted. I like my beansprouts cooked and no peanuts and they did that for me. The noodles were soft and not to sweet or sour. The chicken had flavor in it and wasn't dry so yay them! I know that there were mixed reviews about their pad thai, but I mean it was still pretty tasty. Not the best, but still better than other places.

Beef Pad See Ew ($7): BF has a hard time trying something else too because he loves pad see ew as much as I love pad thai! I had a bite of his dish and it wasn't too overly soy saucy? It comes with chinese broccoli and not american broccoli so that is always a plus...Eggs were perfectly mixed into the noodles so that it had the soy sauce taste in it as well and it didn't just taste like eggs.

Service:
Besides the menu part, I mean everything else was okay. You really do get the check like 5 minutes after your food is brought to the table! That didn't bother us so we just left it there until we finished. Drinks were refilled once they saw that it was almost empty.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A solid 3 star.

Typically when I review I compare against other Thai restaurants I've been to and the level of food standard and service.

 Although there are higher ranked Thai places in the area I went with guests that flew in from South Korea.  This was my friend's favorite thai place when we were students at CSUF many years ago.  

One thing that got me confused was that she went out of her way to mention that the lunch menu is available even during dinner.  We asked what the difference was and she said the lunch one is smaller.  We ordered the dinner portion but when it came out it was clearly the lunch portion.  

The food was not bad...not great either.  Really a solid middle number.  I'd only really come here if it were close to where I was at and didn't want to drive.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've probably eaten here 25+ times, usually lunch, and I've always enjoyed the food.  The lunch menu is well-priced, with most everything less than $8. Lately, I have been ordering the Spicy Brown rice plate. Sometimes I get it with veggies mixed in, other times with shrimp. Today I tried it with seafood, and there was an abundance: calamari, mussels, shrimp, white fish. Usually the dish has lots of the brown rice, but today the seafood was so generously served, there was less rice than usual.  I'm not complaining, exactly, but I missed my rice!

Let me say something about their brown rice. It's their own blend, and it's freaking delicious.  Yes.  Delicious brown rice!  I love it. 

Other good dishes are the pepper shrimp, salmon curry, angry beef and the eggplant. 

Each lunch comes with a small soup (the weakest part of the meal..sometimes it's gelatinous), a won ton, an egg roll and rice.  

We discovered that we could bring wine in ($8 corkage), so we did so today. Not sure why it never had occurred to me before. Usually I have a Thai beer. 

Friendly place, but very busy at lunch time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time here and fell in love food is amazing....service is great! I got the green curry and pad ke mao both were blasted with flavor...new fav thai spot that has the heat and flavor!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have never been treated so terribly in a restaurant. I came here with my friend to meet another friend of ours who had already ordered a bowl of soup. As we sat down the server ignored us and dropped the check to our friend who told us she thought she had told the waitress she was expecting 2 more. She basically yelled at us that she would "be right back" three times when we tried to ask for water. We waited at least ten minutes and when she finally "came right back" she didn't say a word and just stared at us waiting for us to order. We ordered and after 20 minutes one plate came out. 13 minutes later, the next plate came... And finally 17 minutes after the first plate came out the last one came (yes I was definitely timing it at this point.) the food is good but not worth the unbelievably rude service, and incredibly terrible timing with our food. Zero stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quality isn't top of the line of course if you've eaten at a lot of a Thai restaurants I'm sure you'd agree; HOWEVER, I've been coming here since it's inception and I like it.  The owner is sweet, the help staff is kind and prompt, most of the time.  Tonite I'm having #59 Ghang Keow and #39.  It's all good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great local place for yummy Thai food! The portions are decently sized for what you pay. The service is fast and friendly. The lunch specials are the best!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Apart from some hand picked items , nothing else is as good as it seems from the outside. .Firstly you get a spacious parking outside, later after you enter, if the seats are full, d staff don't bother to check ya out which pissed me off the first time. If your lucky you get a seat and again the staff treat you like alien objects until your ready to order something..I would expect a little more service from them next time..

On the positive side, this place has some really tasty authentic thai food. .their egg rolls r great appetizers, noodles simply great..overall a place to consider if you just wear blinkers do your job of eating without much expectations and then jus get out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'll make this quick, as this place already had lots of good reviews.

Beef panag, glass noodle salad, pad see ew are so good.  Panag not served with rice for some reason.  If you like the glass noodle salad, try the snow flower salad, same thing but instead of noodle you get this ocean "flower" thing that has the crunchy texture similar to wood ear mushroom.  If you love the sauce with the salad, these suckers soak it up like a sponge!  So good, but it will get spicy!  Anything over a 5 is too spicy for me.  I was tearing up, but it was so good I kept eating.

The beef salad while a nice portion, the beef was rather chewy.  I think it may have been sirloin, and I don't care for that cut, but if you like sirloin, this should be fine with you.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QOL-eFJ8iEHJNoOZCowhlw?select=ITHZp8Nuad8ToweN_g_S3A

Pad see ew and and curry are easily a two meal dish each.  Great portion size.  Have yet to try their "specials" sizes though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Seating in a booth waiting for our order, and there comes the cockroach coming up to eat my food with me.  Awesome!  =(

Told the management and they didn't care. Disgusting!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst Thai food I've ever had and I've had many. I didn't think you could mess up pad see ew but this place figured it out and it was all bad! It was extremely greasy did not taste fresh and the chicken looked like left over scraps. It was disgusting, hardly edible.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I LOVE THIS PLACE there dinner special is very nice.. great portions.. very friendly staff. even a dinner special with wine for two.. really cute lol..

i love the curry chicken  .. the rice is tasty..this is a great small little place. me and my honey just one day were bored and were being fickle about going to the regular places and just said.. screw it let's try a random new place and we found such a cute little gem of a restaurant!. definitely we go to this place when we think THAI.. mmm :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely loved this place. I've wanted to eat here for years now and never came in, finally tonight my boyfriend and I stopped in and we were not disappointed.  Customer service, price and quality were amazing.  I highly recommend this restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pad thai and spring rolls were delicious.  Order take out for the first time.  Was not spicy at all since my wife can't handle it but u can ask them for extra spicy and extra bean sprouts.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have a few go to Thai places in my frequented areas. And this one is my go to in the OC. I found this place by getting an recommendation from a local. And I love their green papaya salad and pad Thai. It's clean, prices are good. The only compliant I might have is that their portion sizes are sometimes small.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Amazing food. Pad thai and thai fried rice were the bomb. The fried chicken was soft on the inside, crunchy on the inside, and very flavorful.

The only downside is the somewhat small portions that they give you. I may be a little biased, given that we had a party of 5, but it does fill you up, I guess.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">For a$10 lunch special I thought the portion size was eh, the meal itself tasted decent not great The egg roll was disappointing. 

all in all... This place ain't nothing special.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of my favorite places on earth. I come here literally once a week. They have an amazing lunch special menu and even though they are normally packed the customer service is great.
I always order the Beef Panang with a side of fried rice, and the Pad Thai noodles. Yummy!! Highly highly recommend this place, specially if you love spicy food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their dinner specials are pretty amazing and fulfilling. Besides the main dish, it comes with 2 wontons, 2 veggie egg rolls, soup or salad, rice (fried, steam, or brown), and comes with a drink (soda, Thai Ice Tea, or Thai Iced Coffee). Getting the drink with the meal won me over!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So, my wife, our son, and I met up with a friend of ours for lunch. They seated us at the last booth in the back, probably because of my 7-month old son, then ignored us for most of the visit. By the time the food arrived, our friend had to ask for a to-go box as her lunch break at work was almost over. When the box finally arrived and she started getting set to put her lunch in it, she discovered a dead WASP that had been cooked into her food. The restaurant remade her food, but offered no apology, failed to send a manager over to our table, and made no offer to adjust the check. WTF?!  Never eating here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is good, prices a tad big expensive.  Why i gave it a 3 star is the service.  Waiters have a plain look on their faces, like they are not happy to see a customer walk in.  You have to wave a waiter down if you need something.  You even have to ask for the bill.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Once a month they leave a menu on my door. I am sick of them littering their trash at my apartment and I can't wait for them to go out of business. I would never order from them<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always come here during our annual conference in Fullerton... RSVP if your time is limited to avoid long queue. We had Shrimp Pad thai noodle and Massaman curry. Delicious!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Over the years I have been here numerous times, and each time the food is worse and of recently,  more expensive and smaller portions.  My boyfriend and I just had it last night and I am very done! I will never be going back, no matter how much I crave thai food ( which is usually the case and the reason I pop in there)  bye bye thai basil, there are are many other businesses that will do much better I'm sure.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is awesome because of their lunch specials. A friend and I had their roasted duck lunch special, beef salad lunch special, and fresh spring rolls and it was all awesome and the total came out to around 23 dollars.  

They had a egg drop soup (included in the lunch special) which was perfect for the chilly weather and their egg rolls and wontons are never overly breaded and crispy. 

The duck was pretty fatty but, I mean, it's duck so no surprise there. And the beef salad was refreshing and tangy. 

If you ask them for their hot sauces, they will bring out three containers: hot spices, tiny sliced jalapeño-type peppers, and the classic asian hot sauce you get everywhere(not siracha),  

I went to CSUF for undergrad and ate here frequently. It was good then - but eating here three years later makes it even tastier because it reminds me of all the good memories I had in college. Wish I lived closer and I'd frequent here more often.

Definitely recommend! I asked for a spicy level six but next time I'd opt for seven (I like spicy).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went here for the first time last night with friends who frequent the place. All the food our party ordered was overall good and they had a $2 beer special which is always nice. The decor was nothing special but comfortable. The reason I am giving this restaurant 3 stars is because of the extremely uninviting customer service. 

We arrived at 9:20 which is an entire 40 minutes before they are supposed to close at 10 p.m. As a former restaurant server I know how frustrating it can be when customers walk in 10 minutes before closing but we were there 40 minutes before. The man that greeted us was less than happy we were there, frowned the whole time and dropped the menus in a pile on the table after seating us. We were all very polite and ordered our food and drinks within 5 minutes of sitting down. While we were eating the entire staff was standing/sitting in empty booths in the middle of the restaurant with frowns on their faces waiting for us to finish eating. Before we even paid the bill they started vacuuming 15 feet from our table.

I will probably give this restaurant another chance because the food was decent. A warning to everyone though, do not show up after 9 p.m. because you won't feel welcome.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Loved going to this place when I attended CSUF! I always tried getting their lunch special deal cuz it's really worth it for the price! Their orange chicken here is the best! I always order that coming here and never had a problem with it. The atmosphere in this place is really cool and beautiful. Would recommend this place to anyone that is in the mood to eat some delicious Thai food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Literally, my favorite dinner spot. A vegetarian's dream. I always get the Green Chili & Garlic Tofu, spicy level 8 with a side of steamed rice. Ugh, amazing! I always call ahead to pick it up, and they have it ready within 20 minutes. They are so nice too!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai Basil, the go-to Thai restaurant in Fullerton for EVERYONE.

I'm very surprised that as I'm currently writing this Thai Basil only has a 3.5 star rating because I don't know ANYONE who's been to this place that doesn't like it. I can only imagine that the reason someone has given Thai Basil a poor rating is because of how crowded it gets and that it may have taken a while for them to get their food.

As I mentioned above the place gets crowded. When? Every single day at lunch time. I don't even bother going between the hours of 12 and 1 because it's just a mad house. How the waiters maintain composure, get everything correct, and most always get the food out in a reasonable time is beyond me. The staff is great!

Food is top notch. Everything I get here tastes wonderful but my favorite and what I believe they're known for is the Pad Thai. I like to get mine with tofu and ask for extra peanuts. 

Get in this restaurant at a good time and enjoy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai food is a hit and miss but this place has been consistently providing good food no matter when and what time i go.

I have tried their green curry, yellow curry, chicken satay (yummy). If you are a vegetarian their Basil Delight is a must have.

Food can be a bit on the spicy end though. I can't take too much spice so when I ask for mild, i still feel that the food is spicy. It might be a good idea if they can tone down on the spiciness at least for those who ask for mild.

Service can be a bit lacking as they seemed to be understaffed during peak hours. Other than that the place seems to be clean and organized.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Go to place with me and sister.

Service: 
- Friendly (when my sister is with me)

Food: 
- Good (Not horrible but not the only place to go eat)

Location:
- Great (Starbucks, yogurt, etc... anything you usually need is near thanks to CSUF)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of those places that make you feel like a family inviting you into their home. They have very home-y type dishes, as well as traditional pad see ew, pad thai, and curries. What I love is that the food seems very fresh and not MSG-y. The food has been consistently satisfying and service is excellent!! The ladies are always so nice!

Overall, it's a good local Thai place for not having to drive far from Brea/Fullerton, with a home-y feel. For extra kick, ask for chili and they'll bring you a great variety. Prices are ok, not super cheap take out prices (but it's not cheap take out quality either), and not super expensive. They have great dinner and lunch deals that include appetizers and great thai tea!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I always get food here to go, so my review can be based on that.  I always get the pad Thai; it's delicious.  When I pick up my order it's like any old place.  Give them my money, give me my food.  I had it tonight, and had to write a review because it was bomb.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Personally, I think its the best Thai food in Fullerton and surrounding areas!! 
Chicken Satay w. peanut sauce and the Tum Yong Gung soup, excellent starters!  The Panang and noodle dishes (padthai) are also very good! The service is decent, it can get a little slow at times but the place is usually pretty busy... The staff is friendly and quality of food is very tasty. 

I really like the sauces and spices here, get an eight on the scale and its pretty hot! We have been coming here for a very long time and have enjoyed it each and every time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'd sometimes see this place whenever I'm in the area, but I never really thought of trying it out before. After all, I'm still a noob when it comes to Thai food.

Anywho, I came here with a few people I had just met at CSU Fullerton, and it was definitely not a disappointment. Before coming here, I had Thai food once before at this hole-in-the-wall spot in Anaheim on Gilbert and Lincoln, and that was it. So I was very well looking forward to what Thai Basil had to offer.

I ordered their curry fried rice (I'm sure there's an exact name for it, but that's what it literally was... fried rice mixed with curry sauce). It was so delicious! I absolutely loved it. That was probably the best fried rice I've ever had in my life as well. Better yet, they give you large portions of food here at Thai Basil, so it's even more bang for your buck.

The staff is friendly as well, and the lady who took our orders and whatnot seemed to know the rest of the group I was with (I guess they come here often).

This place gets so packed though, it's crazy. When we got here, there was only a few customers, but as we were finishing up our foods, the entire place was packed with people. As we were leaving, this big group of people (about 7 or 8 peeps?) entered the restaurant.

So I suppose this restaurant is quite popular. I've noticed that, overall, Thai food is growing in popularity nowadays, and I can definitely see why. Such delicious food... full of flavor. And Thai Basil really helped deliver that to its customers.

Highly recommend this place for those who love Thai food, or are curious to try out Thai food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">In my honest opinion, I don't know why this place is so busy ALL of the time!  Their food is just ok...not good but not horribly bad either.  There are a few good Thai places I've tried and this is def not one of them.  Their egg rolls are weirdly chewy and their Chicken with Chili and Garlic is just meh...something I feel I can get from a fast food Chinese joint.  Their Pad Thai is also overly sweet and a really weird bright orange color  o_O  Service is also lacking.  SO...like I said, I don't understand why this place is always so busy when there's another Thai place right across the street from them...with better tasting food and service btw.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their shrimp pad kee Mao is perfect cooking!! I  was never eat how good Thai pad kee Mao in America, everyone should try their pad kee Mao,awesome.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been coming here for a while. The last take out I ordered had hair in it!! Don't think I'm coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried the BBQ chicken (half) entree and pa nang curry. The BBQ chicken looked like it was marinated in a yellow curry sauce. The taste was mediocre. 
The pa nang curry was also whatever. The only thing about the pa nang curry that was good was the spiciness level. 
And just a heads up, neither of dishes come with rice. It was weird to not get rice with the curry. Don't think I'll be returning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">By far the best Thai restaurant in the area!

Their green curry with tofu is my fav. They will ask you how spicy you want from 1 to 10. I am a huge spicy fan but I ordered a 7 and it was almost unbearable so be careful. Their food packs some heat! 

My husband loves the red curry with chicken and the angry beef. He always leaves his plate clean. 

The pad thai is also delicious and when ever I feel like indulging, I order the mango sticky rice for desert. It is the best :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best chicken coconut soup I've ever had in my life! I could eat here all day everyday. There is nothing bad about this place or their menu.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of the best Thai restaurants I've eaten at! This place is a first for me and I will definitely be back!! Tom Yum Shrimp is a must try!!  Service was great too!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I use to love this place,  I don't know if maybe the they were having an off day but the food was missing so much flavor.  My favorite dish  (pad see ew) was bland and the meat had an old taste to it. I love this place and sad it was not good as always.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is so wonderful for lunch specials. With the special you get soup, egg roll, wonton and the main course meal. The specials are so filling and the best part is super cheap. I really love a good bargain and I find it here everytime. 

I always like to have good white meats. I have never had a problem with the quality of meat like I do at some Asian restaurant. They also let you customize how spicy you want a dish from 0-10. 

The only downfall I can see if the crowds and the service. Sometimes there is only one or two server and the place is packed. It can be hard to get a refill or the check. But if you dont mind some patience you will not be sorry. This place is really very amazing everytime!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Place is really clean and food for most part is fresh. Always busy everytime i came here<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Thai food so I'm always up for trying new Thai places!  The dinner special is pretty good deal!  In addition to the main dish, it comes with rice (choice of steamed, brown or fried rice), soup or salad, complimentary drink, and complimentary dessert.  The portion size is sufficient.  I ordered the mixed veggies with chicken dinner special and was delicious.  It has a nice presentation too.  The complimentary dessert is sticky rice.  While I didn't try it, my friend thought it was disappointing.  It's salty!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My wife and I had a dentist appointment today for cleanings so I figured we needed to dirty them back up with some food. Since this place is pretty close we went here. As always this sadly reviewed place on yelp was perfect in both food and service. I've been eating here for years and have never once had a bad experience with food or service so it really surprises me that there are so many bad reviews. 

To start we had some beef satay. The beef was tender with no chewy pieces. It was nicely marinated and had nice grill marks. It's served with a sweet peanut sauce and some chopped up pieces of cucumber and peppers. 

For my entree I had my favorite dish here, the chicken larb. As described in my previous review it's a "salad" of ground chicken (or pork/beef) mixed with mint leaves, onion, roasted ground rice, and chili lemon sauce. It's served with green cabbage. I've tried all three meats and the chicken really works the best with this dish. I also like topping it with these little slices of pickled green chilies you can ask for. 

My wife had the salmon pa-nang. The salmon is battered and fried, topped with a red coconut curry. Salmon is a fish I hate.... it literally makes me dry heave. Yet this place uses some Thai magic to perfectly balance that "salmon" flavor with the spicy curry. It's delicious! 

Check this place out.... I have no clue if it's "authentic" or not since I'm not Thai and have never been to Thailand.... but it's some damn good eats!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely not coming back here. I came here at a busy time, but that never excuses poor customer service. No one even acknowledged us and we were probably standing there at the desk for a couple minutes until someone finally asked if we were picking up an order. We even saw a couple walk in and they looked confused because no one was seating them and no one even had the courtesy to tell them to wait or anything. They probably thought they had to seat themselves or order at the desk. It was too hectic. But that's not the worst part...

I just wanted to get a Thai tea to go. Not even get seated or anything. I looked around and almost everyone had a Thai tea so I was excited. I will say that the lady was kind enough to take our credit card for ~$2 (which usually doesn't slide with a $10 minimum but we didn't have cash). That was cool of her. BUT, once I got it, it tasted SOUR. Yes, sour. It tasted old and I felt like I was going to get food poisoned. I went back and told them it was sour, and they said, "We always serve Thai tea..." Which didn't explain much but they opened up a new milk carton and made me another drink. It tasted better at first, but strangely again it started to taste sour. I ended up just throwing it out. It was kind of them to make me a new drink, but it was a waste of money. I know it's not just me because my boyfriend said it tasted sour, too. It must be the tea, but I am definitely not coming back. The Thai tea across the street at Thailandia is way better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">what a disappointment.  Nothing impressive or memorable about this place.  I came in for lunch at around 11:30 and it wasn't busy.  I ordered pad Thai lunch special. which is not on the lunch menu.  $1.50 extra booooooo! most Thai places pad Thai is the first thing on the lunch menu.  Any who the special came with veggie soup, egg roll, fried wonton, brown rice and the main dish.  The portions were great, lunch special and i had plenty of left overs.  The pad Thai however was very bland.  Pretty much greasy noodles with chicken and egg. I had to drench it in red pepper flakes and hot sauce.  
Bottom line i wont be returning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite Thai place in Fullerton.  A hidden gem behind Office Depot. Nice pad Thai with peanuts, shrimp, and lime. The coconut shrimp appetizer is great with the pineapple dipping sauce. If you like spicy and you like duck and pineapple curry. It's amazing. Lots of seating but only a few near the window. This place is very worth the dollar and is not over priced. Good portion sizes too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pad see ewww!  Sooooo gross.  Won't eat here even if it's free.  One shrimp alot of basil. Sizzling rice soup was not good.  Level 4 rice was so spicy.  Never again!  Thumbs down<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite Thai restaurant! Or more like the only one I know... But YUM the Pad See Ew here is so delicious! I've tried the same dish at other places but no where compares to here. I'm not Thai though so I don't know how "legit" this place is...

The service here wasn't that great when I went. They serve this soup in the beginning before your main dish comes out, and when I asked what kind of meat was in it, I don't think they understood me? I don't know but their response was annoying because they just kept not answering the question in poor English.

BUT it's okay because I care more about food than service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's my family's go to Thai restaurant in the area. I usually order their red curry with vegetables and their pad see ew! They're both great dishes!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My go-to spot for Thai food. I've never had any complaints over the food. My favorite dish to get is during lunch time, the salmon teriyaki with brown rice. I think what I like most about this place is the atmosphere and the friendly employees. They're always nice and greet me like they know me. Then again, they probably do cause I do come here often.

Overall, I enjoy my eating experiences here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3.5 stars overall on yelp...I should've listened and saved my Thai cravings for elsewhere.

Both the sweets and I got the dinner specials which were $12 something and just enough for 1 meal.  The actual dishes come with a decent amount to share and you don't get the won ton, salad, etc fillers to make the special seem...special.  There was a ton of onions in my chicken dish and the "med spicy" beef dish that the BF ordered was pretty damned on the hot side.  Overall not impressed but if someone wants to vouch for them, I'd give them another try because they're pretty close to me.

Very unfortunate to not find a decent Thai place near Fullerton / Brea.  Suggestions are always welcome!!  Really hoping to find a place with some kick ass Pad See Ew, Spicy Beef Salad, Pad Thai or Satay.  There's a ton I haven't tried but I'm open to it...so if anyone has a "you have to try this" suggestion...gimme gimme!!  :)  Thanks!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered the pad kee mao, pad thai, and the yellow curry (I forgot which one) and all three dishes were so delicious!  My favorite out of the three would have to be the pad thai. I also really enjoyed their pickled jalapeños, they really went well with all the dishes!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely a great Thai food place. This place is very accommodating to your food needs. I am vegetarian and it's always difficult for me to find a place that provides amazing Asian food. The staff is nice and friendly. Sometimes it takes time for the staff to get your attention when they're very busy on Fridays and weekends. I definitely recommend this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was pretty pissed that the server was telling me I was lying and trying to tell me what to order?! 

I recently moved back to the area and wanna search my old memory in this small restaurant. I have to admit it only gets worst. Since last weekend's early dinner, I think it is time to leave old memory to its best. 

Our serve was an middle age straight hair lady with glasses. She was ok until she took order. I was craving for the soup I used to have in the old days and I wanted it the same way. She told me there is no way they would make this for me and it never happened. No matter how many I explained I was pretty sure I had it many times here. All I had to do was to pay an extra dollar for it. She was convinced to ask the kitchen finally and came back said it was $0.50 more, it was never less like I said. Was she trying to say I was lying? First, you told me you have been working here for that long time and there was no such a request accepted before, now you are telling me it would be ok if I am willing to pay more than I said? FINE!! Let's do it. I was really craving for the soup.

Then I asked for a Satay and would like it half / half. She said, "NO! you can't do that!" I was totally pissed by her attitude from the beginning of our conversation. I said, "well, forget it then!" 

I was quite offended what she said to me next, "what don't you just order the whole thing?" I started to get annoyed, "it's ok, forget about it!" 

FOOD:
Soup came. The food inside the soup was totally lacking. I would say maybe 1/3 to 1/2 was missing, mushroom, shrimp, tomatoes, much less! I used to scoop out a lot of lemongrass and ginger before. This time, I had to keep digging. I felt like it was a ripped off. 

Will not go back again!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food, good prices but terrible service.  It's terrible even when you order togo. Beware...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food is great, service is horrible. 
The only reason I come here is for the food, nothing else. 

I love the curries and noodle dishes. I've only had one plate here I did to like.. It was a noodle dish, the description sounded alright, noodles with veggies in oyster sauce. I got this because I was sharing the dish w a friend and I let him choose. The noodles were in a bowl with thick sticky oyster sauce all over the bottom. It kinda grossed me out.

Anywhoo, maybe ppl should just take out or order over the phone from here. Even tho u will probably still get someone rude over the phone or at the counter.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Without a doubt my favorite Thai place to eat. I've been here on a regular basis for years and have not had a single bad experience. I'm always ordering right before they close because I own a restaurant and close late. They've never hesitated to still take my order, which most places won't do or will be pissy about, and I always appreciate that. Food is always consistent and extremely tasty. Restaurant is always busy and they totally deserve to be with such great food and prompt service. 5 stars!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! The Drunken Noodle is DELICIOUS!!!! Prices are great and I've never had a problem with service! Also, take out is fast and easy!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of the BEST Thai food I've ever had! I love their lunch specials. They range from $6.95-9.95, which is not bad for a lunch special. :) Although the lunch special does not fill you up, it does satisfy your hunger. So far so good! Excellent and fast service!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just placed my order and already annoyed. It felt like my waitress just wanted to get my order out of the way. I said thank you multiple times whenever she gave me something and I received no response in return. Rude!!!!!! The lady in the back who brought out my lemons was nice though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried this place out after my wife and I needed to stop by Dollar Tree after moving into our new place. The food was pretty good. We got the Fried Won Tons, Green Chili and Garlic Shrimp, and the Pad Kee-Mao w/beef (Spicy Noodles). The place was clean, the food was delicious, and the service was great! Their dishes don't use the dried red peppers that you get at the Mexican markets. They use Thai green chili's which make the dishes more authentic to add that authentic Thai spices. We're definitely going to make this our neighborhood Thai place. We were about to go to Thailandia across the street, but we're glad we stopped by this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai Basil is the best! The food is amazing, especially the green and yellow curries! The noodle dishes and chicken satay are also wonderful. The staff is kind and does a great job. I go to Thai Basil frequently and have had a great experience every time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Place is decent. Friends brought us here and the service and food were quite good. Lunch special is a good deal too. Spice level was a bit lower than i'm used to. I'd probably up it a bit next time and it would be much better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Bad service , good food but the time it takes Someone to your table (really) are they so cheap they can't hire a few more servers ! It would actually help them :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their lunch specials are delicious. Friendly servers with great service!!! Shrimp with house special sauce is so good!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I come here a lot because its close to my gym and I love it. There is another thai place literally right across the street called Thai Rama but it does not even compare with ambiance, prices, and quality!

1. Always have Lunch and dinner Specials!  7.95 you can get a curry, noodle, or traditional thai dish that comes with side of rice, wonton, egg roll, and soup! Dinner is 12.95 but comes with all that plus a salad and glass of wine. 
2. Service is SO good here. They are SO nice and go the extra mile to help you box your food and refill your water without asking.

They have a whole vegetarian menu Which includes dishes like spicy eggplant., baby corn & mushroom, garlic and green chili tofu, ect. They can also make ANY dish vegetarian by replacing meat with Tofu.

My favorite is the Spicy green curry and instead of a meat add eggplant and tofu.  They ask you on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you want it. I get the number 10 spiciest - Its not that spicy! It could be spicier but I really like it!!! They also bring you a some little jars of different chilis you can add to make it hotter.

Mango Sticky Rice dessert is So amazing!!!! 6.95
Coconut Ice cream dessert is so good too! 2.95<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">the food here is pretty good, and a lot more authentic IMHO than some ... eh ... thai chain restaurants further down the road that uses way too much sugar. thai food is supposed to a balanced medley of sweet, sour, spicy, salty, etc. 

we've eaten here a few times and taken out more. the prices are a bit high and the portions smaller than i'm used to. plus, they charge for rice which is becoming a huge pet peeve of mine at any restaurant. 

in all, i like the service & the food is consistent and tasty enough to satisfy my thai food cravings!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is bomb dot com. I try to order something new every time I go and I am yet to ve disappointed. Love the food, the alcohol, the prices and the service!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would give this 0 stars if I could. My mom and I stopped by because my classmates highly suggested the place. The food wasn't that good, but the service was okay. However, the reason why I would give it 0 stars is because we got terrible stomach flu a few hours after we ate. Even as I'm typing this now, my stomach is turning and can't keep anything in.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Had lunch here a couple days ago, the food was very flavorful and the service was fine.  I brought home some leftovers, a beef rice noodle dish, and had it for dinner a couple nights later, it was still fantastic.
I had the duck salad for my lunch, it was tasty, the duck was good.  My only complaint would be portion sizing on the duck, however the other dish was big enough for another meal as a leftover, so I guess that made up for it.
I definitely plan on going back and trying more dishes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went to this place numerous times when I was a grad student. Loved it! Pretty affordable for a student like me and the atmosphere was always. Ice following a long and arduous midterm.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is pretty good when it comes to food and service, but then again, there were only 3-4 other tables aside from us.

This is a big restaurant with nice seating, decor, and is very clean. The servers were attentive and nice throughout our dining experience.

We ordered the Beef Pad See Ew, Chicken Pad Thai, Korean Style BBQ Ribs with Fried Rice, a Thai Iced Tea and Thai Iced Coffee.

The beef pad see ew was not as sweet compared to other thai restaurants I've been to. I'm more accustomed to the sweetness of the pad see ew compared to Thai Basil's version. The vegetables were nice and crisp. This dish was decent.

The chicken pad thai was freaken awesome. The noodles and meat are piled together, peanuts on the side and bean sprouts on the side. You mix it yourself according to your own taste. The noodles were perfectly cooked, the chicken had a lot of flavor, and the bean sprouts were nice and fresh. It had the right amount of sweetness to it as well. Highly recommended.

Korean Style BBQ Ribs with the Fried Rice was also a good dish. The ribs were very tender and literally fell off the bone. It had the right amount of sauce on them as well. They gave a good amount of ribs for the dish so that's a major plus. This came with a side of fried wontons (I think?) as well. I didn't try the fried rice so no opinion there.

Thai Iced Tea and Thai Iced Coffee were good. Not too sweet and not too bitter.

We also received a bowl of congee which was nice. The rice wasn't mushy and it came out warm.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good place for lunch.  I rate the food around 3.5 except for the sticky rice which I just love.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My BF and I ordered the pad thai and thai fried rice. The pad thai was ok, I wished it had a bit more flavor. The Thai fried rice was pretty good and exceeded my expectations-the tomatoes were so juicy! The pricing and portions are also very good<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have come here on 3 occasions and have had the pad-see ew and it has been great every time! I usually get it with tofu or shrimp and its only $6.95 plus $1 for shrimp. 

The food is fresh, hot, and great quality! Taste good every time. It is always good.

I have also had the shrimp fried rice and the pad-thai but the pad see-ew is the best! 

It has a nice ambiance, it is a cheap meal but it still looks nice inside. Would recommend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've walked out of this restaurant twice after being completely neglected.  They seat you and then completely ignore you.  It took me 30 minutes to get my check the first time, then received no service the next two- seated and ignored for 20 minutes. Strike 3.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this Restaurant it has the best crying tiger and the prices are right I will definitely recommend this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for lunch. GREAT lunch specials, but definitely a place I would take my out of town friends or family when they visit.   It's a good spot to come if you're in a rush. I ordered the Salmon lunch special and the Chicken Mint--perfect portion for lunch and definitely filling.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Vegan's paradise. Everything on the main dish menu can be made vegetarian or vegan. I got orange tofu aka orange chicken vegan style...  BOMBBBBBBB MOUTH WATERING!!!!!! And I got veggie pad thai no egg DAAAAAANNGGG I can't say enough about the deliciousness. I'm going back to try everything! It's so weird having so many options because as a vegan I'm used to having only a few options, I think that's the coolest part.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai Basil has been here since there was a football team at Cal State Fullerton which goes back over twenty years.  I just happen to need some stuff at Dollar Tree across the way, and decided to kill the growling sound my stomach was making in line. translated from body talk said, "Feed Me".  Besides, I didn't want to give up the parking spot I fought so hard to get, stalking an old couple as they loaded stuff in their car. When they saw me, they probably slowed down, those manipulative geezers.

Anyway, i hadn't eaten here in over 6 years, and by the looks of it, nothing inside has changed since then except the student waiter, She was smiling and friendly.  Within 30 seconds she brought out my coke, and with her pen in hand asked if I was ready to order.  I said, "Sure, what kept you?" but with a smirk wrote down my order, chicken curry with rice and salad for $6.99.  Good deal.  

The food came out in 5 minutes, and she refilled my coke. Seems everyone got their food quickly. She zipped around the other tables in my section like a road runner.  With cheap lunches, to make decent tip money, one has to fly, I guess. The food itself was average, I like a little more coconut milk, though the medium hotness was perfect. Portion size wasn't bad but at this price, ti was a very fair deal.  I finished my meal and read my emails in 10 minutes, and the waitress asked if I needed more coke or wanted to order anything else.  I said, "No thank you, no thank you." She hands me my check, I hand her my credit card ready, and handed it back immediately.  She comes back in two minutes, and I sign it, tip her, and walk out the door.

Decor I didn't care about but it was clean so no big deal. Service was good, the price was good, and the food was just ok.  I'd definitely go back.  As I left, someone was stalking me as I loaded my stuff in the car before seat belting myself in.  I took my time of course.
.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Placed a takeout order for tom yum soup, pad thai, and sweet and sour chicken. After the conversation was over, I had to stop the lady from hanging up on me twice to tell me how soon I should come and pick up and for her to repeat my order. She seemed annoyed when I asked her to repeat it. Like really? And the food isn't even that great. It's just really cheap which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Because I was eating alone I was seated at the front of the restaurant in the windows on the other side of the plants. I was ignored by the wait staff for over 15 minutes despite constant efforts to flag down a waiter or host without being rude. After trying for 20 minutes, in vain to place an order I got up and walked out. Despite the bells on the door the staff didn't even notice as I left.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We had been missing Thai food since our favorite Thai restaurant closed.  Thai Basil may end up filling that gap.  Tonight the service was friendly and speedy, the food was good, and the price was reasonable.  We had Pad Thai and Pa-Nang, a curry dish, and liked them both.  We ordered the Pa-Nang at a hotness level of 3 out of 10.  (I've been to Thai restaurants where dishes rated 1 out of 5 darn near killed me.)  It had a pleasant warmth, but didn't make me sweat, and was very tasty.  
The menu is large, but doesn't have a lot of Thai dishes on it.  It has some salads, some noodle dishes and a few curries.  Most of the rest appear to be Chinese dishes (Mongolian Chicken, etc.).
This isn't an atmosphere place - you walk in, you eat, you leave - no pretense about it.  It's clean.  In the bathroom there's a sign asking you not to dispose of foreign objects.  Next time I'll bring some domestic ones.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am a regular at Thai Basil, and I love their food! Great portion, great price and great quality! I was introduced to this resteraunt by a good friend and have became a regular ever since!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pad see ew here is okay - it was pretty greasy, if you are into that. The pad kee mao was okay, I got the spicy one and it was almost exactly the same as the pad see ew, just spicier. This place is a little on the dirty side and the service is A-OK. There is nothing probing me to come here more often and nothing here that will make me never want to come back.

Overall, the food here is OK and decent. There are no refills on Thai iced tea either :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai Basil is one of the most convenient Thai spots in the Cal State Fullerton area. They have great lunch specials from 11 am-3 pm that include 25 dishes to choose from, an egg roll, a wonton, and your choice of rice. Prices of the lunch specials are reasonable and range from $6-$8. Some of my favorites are the:

+Green chili and garlic beef: sauteed serrano chili peppers and onions. 

+Crying tiger: charbroiled beef with a side of hot chili sauce.

+Poached salmon:  a moist and flaky salmon filet with a side of mixed vegetables.

They also have other great dishes such as the shrimp spring roll appetizer with a flavorful peanut sauce and the glass noodle stir fry with cellophane noodles, sliced tomatoes, onions, green onions, baby corn, mushroom, veggies, scrambled eggs, and shrimp or chicken.

For the prices, portions, and flavorful food, Thai Basil is a great spot to grab a quick bite for lunch or dinner.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Thai iced tea without cream. Not so sweet. Not so bad! Likity like. Pad kee Mao without fish sauce for the vegetarian. Fast service. Thumbs up!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great lunch specials!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I recently moved back into the area after being gone over 12 years.  I can say I now have found MY Thai Restaurant.  I always want to try something new, but can't get past my favorites.  Be sure to not overlook the appetizer section.  The eggrolls are wonderful, and the chicken satay is the best around.  You can tell they're using real pieces of chicken, not the frozen processed chicken everywhere else is serving.  The curries are amazing.  They'll ask you how hot you want it on a scale from 1-10...doesn't get more personal than that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went here with my family for dinner. My pad see ew was really salty from the first bite. I couldn't eat it without rice. The pork in my dad's curry was full of tendons that he had to toss them aside, which was amazing itself because my dad hates wasting food. He's the type of person who'd eat expired/burnt food if no one's stopping him. We all thought the food wasn't as good as other Thai places. 

The customer service was good at first but not so much after we got our order. Trying to ask for refill and more rice took awhile. My family was more annoyed that the waitress just left us boxes for us to box our own food yet the same waitress boxed the food of the table next to us. We have no problems boxing food ourselves but that sort of preferential service is a bit rude. We didn't make any outrageous demands nor were we rude to her either (unless asking her to repeat herself because of her thick accent counts).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am in Love with this food!

I had most of all the Vegetarian dishes and all of them are very good!

The Ghang Ped / Red Curry With Coconut Milk, bamboo shoot, tofu and I added pineapple was delicious.  they give you the choice of how spicy you want your food from 1 to 10.

the Pineapple fried rice is with tofu is a must as well! I always request it without egg since am a vegan! but is as you wish!

the Pad Thai Veggie is also a good choice. you can also get it with our without egg.

The Basil Delight is a good choice if you like spice. its a dish with basil leaves and a chili seasoning with stir-fried tofu.

the spicy eggplant is also good.

Just note: this is a family own restaurant and they are the workers they don't hire any body else.  as they get busier you might have to wait longer. its worth the wait.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This was the closet Thai Food restaurant to school so i gave it a try. 

It was pretty good. If I ever crave thai food, this is the place I come to. The service was okay and every time I've gone, there was no wait.<p>

</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food & great service. I loooooove their food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was told to have great expectations of this place.  Of course, I've had great Thai food in Thai town in Hollywood and in Los Angeles in general so I was not expecting much.  Good thing, I didn't.  The food was, meh, ok.  I was told spicy would be very spicy too, meh.  Service was slow but understandably so as this place had as much to-go as dining in.  Would I go back to this place? Yes, it is local and my wife seemed to like their Spicy Beef Fried Rice and Radna.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Started eating thai food cause of the Banana Bay hype that went around in high school. Out of the five thai restaurants I've been to, this one is my top 2. I like that the pad thai's not too sweet and the pad see ew's not too greasy. I recommend their pineapple fried rice and the combination rice. I always end up taking home the leftovers, so to me the portions are fairly large. The servers are not completely fluent in English, but they are prompt and friendly. The place usually gets packed, so if you don't like to wait like me, go a little bit after the regular lunch/dinner hours.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was awesome.
But!!!!!! server was suck.
I think that she wanted to teach us.
I don't want to go there again. NEVER!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's a smaller size restaurant, but the food are decent.  I visited here with my colleague during the break time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a nice place for a small get together if you're in the area by Cal State Fullerton.  This place is packed at lunch time.  They have wonderful lunch specials - it comes with the soup of the day, fried dumpling, and rice (your choice of brown, white, or fried).  The service is great and they are quick to bring your food.  Be careful if you're allergic to peanuts because I told them I didn't want nuts on my pad thai, but they forgot.  Anyways, they were nice to give me a new order and apologize for the mistake.  I love the little decorations they have in the restaurant and each table always have a vase with flowers in it.  If you love spicy, then this is a good place for you because they ask you how spicy do you want it (1 being not spicy and 10 being very spicy).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There's plenty of parking in the shopping plaza where this restaurant is located.

Service was fast and friendly, and food had always been delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just moved to the area and have been on a quest to find good Thai food. This is the first place I tried and have so far found little reason to try another!

I recommend the chicken pad see ew - it's my favorite dish here. Not too oily, not too salty, but the perfect seasoning and a decently priced portion. My sister likes the pineapple fried rice. My mom likes the pineapple curry.

Lunch specials have very good prices and satisfying portions.

I don't recommend the drunken noodles or pad thai - both are very oily and unsettling.

I'm still searching for the perfect drunken noodles - anyone have any recommendations?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is one of my favorite Thai places. They give you decent sized portions for the price you pay. The service is okay. I ordered some pa'nang curry and it came with a wine pairing. There was a lot of food that came with it for around $15 at dinner. The curry is well-flavored. The place is kind of small and can get packed for dinner. I did not really care for the crispy wonton for dessert though. Otherwise, i would definitely come back here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love thai food and thai basil was pretty good! i went there on friday night so it was pretty crowded and we had to wait a little bit! the we had chicken curry + rice which came with an eggroll and pineapple fried rice which came with an egg roll as well. They were both yummy! Oh.. when we were done eating, they were way too busy so we had to take our check to the front & pay for it on our own. Overall good experience & will go back soon to try different dishes! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Check out their lunch specials (available all day), as they're pretty cheap and give you a ton of food! Thai Basil is a great option if you want something a little different than all the other chain places around CSUF.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food nothing out of the ordinary. After many attempts it took me 30 min to get through the phone after it kept giving a busy tone . When someone finally answered, I was told my order needs 30 min to be ready. I'm sure they won't let a customer wait 30 min if they are sitting in. Service and pricing could be better. I asked no ice in my Thai tea and the lady said she has to charge me more which is laughable! Descent experience , could've been much better<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite thai place ever!! Been going here for a few years now and the service is always great. Ordering food to go is a super fast and convenient option as well. They say it takes 15 min for your order to be ready but it's usually done before that. My favorite dish is the pineapple tofu curry. So good!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a good Thai restaurant. They have some generic dishes for a general customer, but they also have some nice Thai dishes with a more authentic flavor. One of my favorites is Crying Tiger! The staff are friendly too, but if you sit toward the back of the place, they can't see you very well and might not come to you as often and you have to try to get their attention for service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here for the 1st time and now its going to be my new Thai restaurant. I've been to many thai places, but the reason this place stands out is because of their overall treatment. The waitresses were kind and very attentive. NOW, the food...OMG delicious!! 
Overall, I am very satisfied with this restaurant, and I will be returning soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! It's really difficult  to find a yummy Thai resturant that is also clean.
Much more i have nut allergies that keeps me from lot of resturant where they don't actually cook to order( pre-made). I was able to request from the Manu n have certain ingredient taken out. Fabulous !<p>
