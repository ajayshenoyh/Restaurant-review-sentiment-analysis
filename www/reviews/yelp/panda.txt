<p itemprop="description">The food is good! Love the flavors n variety. Ya abit pricey tho. Im not sure y such a low rating. Place is clean n nice layout. Staff is friendly. 

The price is abit high for the amount but its soo good<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I forget why i stopped going to panda and then i came here and it reminded why this place is shit.

So i came in and was greeted by 8 employees yelling hello at you when you walk in. Its trashy, just stop. The whole restaurant looks at you when you walk in so unless you dig attention, this is a bad position to put people in. 

Next, it took 2 minutes for someone to take my order and of course I get miss newbie. No offense to new workers, just train them better. She walked away from me a total of five times and opened and closed my box five times. Not sure what she was doing or maybe she was just lost? Finally I pay for my overpriced meal and get to my car. Pull the box out the car and not even opening the lid, the sauce goes all over my car. Absolutely ridiculous. I go inside and tell them I'm going to wash my hands while they figure out a solution so they start making me a new box but they wait for me to come out. Wait another two minutes. I don't know about you but if you have an upset customer I think you're supposed to help them first. So eventually they took too long and I ask for my money back so finally the manager comes out off her lazy ass to ask wheres my receipt. So I brought her my receipt from the car along with all the nasty sauce filled napkins and my wallet with sauce all over it. She finally asked what happened. She had no apologies and just put the money back on my card.

This was the most terrible experience run by college monkeys and inconsiderate management.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I feel so bad for all the employees at this Panda location. They always seem very unhappy, nervous, worried and very stressed out. The cooks, the servers and the cashiers always seem rushed. Whoever runs this location PLEASE come and retrain your employees & hire more since this location is almost always busy with a line out the door.

I placed an online order at 12:45pm and was told my order would be ready at 1:00pm, when I arrived I did not get my food until 1:16pm all while people who were walk ins waited in line, got their food and left all the time I was there waiting for my food because it wasn't ready...after 30 minutes. On top of that, my food order was incorrect & missing items.

I love Panda Express for their food but this location has very poor service. Please pay attention to your business and more importantly pay attention to your employees, they need your help.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a fairly typical Panda Express. Nothing particularly special or out of the ordinary. The food tasted like it has been sitting for a little bit, but not too long. Service was fine, though I'd rather not get asked to donate a dollar to charity every time I pay for my meal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My debit card was not swiping through and usually, the store will manually input my card into their system. This specific location has done it in the past. Today, the same thing happened. My card was not swiping through. The cashier said if she manually inputs it, they get written up. The manager Jorge said they were not allowed to manually input the card which was weird because they've done it in the past. He said I could leave and come back, but for what? To go get another card? To get cash? Then he said I could take the food without paying. Make up your mind. Have some consistency with your policies. You can say that I will not be returning to this location. Ever.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like Panda Express but today was my first time here and I wasn't disappointed. My Kung Pao chicken wasn't spicy enough to make my eyes water, but it's alright. The steamed rice was perfectly soft (not crunchy) as was the fried rice.
Also the people were very friendly when they served me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time coming here and I had a bad experience. I had to wait on chow mein, because they ran out. After I got my order the chow mein tasted burnt. Worst of all I didn't get a fortune cookie:( not cool.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location has become so stingy with some of their food. They practically count the shrimp that they spread out to make look like there is more than there really is. There was only one nice girl working out of all the employees.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Orange chicken good(+5),burn rice(-1),undercook rice(-1), and a chicken nugget taste more real than the chicken eggroll(-1) ov<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here with my boyfriend on Saturday and was greeted by the first girl who served us our food. Keep in mind there was no one in front of me, only behind me. I got a kids meal because I can't finish a regular meal. I'm standing in front of the cashier to pay for my food, and noticed an Asian girl named Cindy just standing there watching the other employees fill people's order. Another employee (I'm guessing a manager) had to tell her to ring us up. No greeting, no smile just the total. As I was walking away I remembered that the kids meal comes with a cookie and a drink. So I went back to Cindy and said "hi. My meal comes with a cookie and a small drink" that smart ass, sarcastically and rudely says "oh yeah?", rolls her eyes, gives me the drink and tells me to get my cookie. Excuse me little miss Cindy. I don't need your smart ass comments, I need my freaking drink and cookie.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Flavor of the food was ok, and the portions were skimpy! I don't think I've ever paid so much for such little food. 2nd time it happens at this location....lesson learned. Stay away from this location....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my favorite place for orange chick ! It's super bomb here ! The staff is very nice and respectful & fast ! All the employees had smiles on there faces ! Line went by quick ! I love it here it's my first time here but I'll be back ! I got orange chicken and I have never had a problem with it ! I wish they would bring back the orange chicken and bacon ! That was so so bomb !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my favorite place to get chow mein and orange chicken! The prices are kinda ridiculous but when I get my pay check I like to spoil myself! The workers are always super friendly and work efficiently so I'm not waiting long periods of times to get my food. They don't pack the food as much as I want but it's okay! Good food good atmosphere<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excelent customer service. This location is always super busy, but the staff always friendly and fast. Both manager work together to maintains the business flow smooth and organize. Doesn't matter how busy they are, the dining and restroom always clean and neat. I love visit this location.....they are the best .....love you panda express<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My kid loves the Orange chicken with bacon! 

Me, I'm not impressed!  I always feel rushed when I'm ordering! Yes they asked me if I wanted a sample but it's as if it's scripted for them to ask (like when you go to a store and your offered the store credit card! ) She didn't give me a chance to say "Yes, may I please try the Beijing Beef" no she said"You want a sample, what would you like" all in one breath!  

So on to the food... Orange chicken was hard, like it had been sitting under the heating lamp for hours! Chow mein was good can't complain! Beijing Beef had a little spiciness to it, the beef was soft and chewable! Beef broccoli was alright! The food didn't leave me wanting more or thinking what I want on my next visit! 

I will be back but only because my son loves the Orange chicken with bacon!

You get a cute little bag full of fortune cookies for only a dollar! 

THREE STARS!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I waited 10 minutes in line because they didn't have food ready for 4 people Infront of me. I wanted to leave but their food is so great I stayed. I'm giving 5 stars so that people will see you might have to wait a while<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If I could give this place zero stars I would. Tonight I had the worse experience I've ever had at any Panda. The place is a nasty mess, food all over the place and it looks a hot mess on the other side. The employees are the rudest too. Starting w the one who took my order, she just stood there waiting for me to tell her what I wanted w out a greeting or nothing then she starts fighting w the cook in the back because there was no orange chicken. The guy then refuses to throw in a new batch because "you don't tell me what to do" that's what he told the girl who asked him to make more. The cashier said out loud how too many people were coming in and she needed to go to the restroom and no one is giving her a break. She failed to give me my correct change back too. I let her keep the .46Â¢ she failed to give me w my change bc well I really don't need them. Managers or franchise owner of this place, please come and check your place out. ITS A MESS! Pretty freaking gross if you ask me. Be more like the La Habra location, they're much nicer and waaaaaay more cleaner than you guys.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'd give zero stars if I could. It was around 1230 lunch time, and food was not fresh and the serving size was ridiculous. They were going to give me about 6 pieces of orange chicken and I stopped the guy and said that's all? The pieces didn't even fill the space it was in. I get that serving size is subjective but this was like something you give to a little kid. They definitely need to up their portion servings and fresher food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Panda Express is exceptionally tasty! The chowmein is perfect! It's all noodles not too much or too large of chunks of cabbage! All the entrees I had were delicious. I had about 5 different ones. The rice was good too not too oily or dry. compared to the other panda locations that I've been frequenting they were all well above and beyond better tasting. I don't know what it is but this one is just so much more cleaner, the employees much more efficient and helpfull.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food and service are fine.  However, there is nothing exceptional about either.  I think the prices are on the high side for what you get.  You don't get a lot of food.  I don't eat much so I don't mind.  The place is busy, so it's really best for people who know what they want.  There really isn't time to sample items here. It is convenient location wise for me, so I don't mind stopping in here.  It appears clean, and there is a lot of parking in the shopping center it is located inside.  

Be warned that if you go after 8:30 p.m. there isn't a lot of choice.  The staff has already begun to shut down.  Half of the steam tray choices are gone, and what is left hasn't been replenished.  However, the staff does try to get your entree ready, and they are pleasant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The surrounding of this restaurant is pretty bad. Always a "professional" panhandler at the front door trying to hustle customers walking in and out. Manager sees him but don't do anything. I said "professional" because I see him working with a group of 4 or 5 as a team, calling on cell phone, coordinating, strolling and stationing the entire shopping center, very professional!

The place gets very busy and under staffed so it's not kept clean, ran out of food, and all kinds of issues.  Not a well run place!  Unfortunately no other half decent Chinese fast food around the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The experience and the vibes here are both bad. The food server tried to tell me there was no sweet and fire chicken. She didn't understand what it was! The cashier seems to hate her job and has side conversations with the person making the food. Very slow, messy and no greeting at all. The last two times I've been here,I got no fortune cookie. Also no soy sauce this time after I asked the cashier for it twice. The employees are supposed to offer it to customers! The Panda express at Malvern ave is way more upbeat and focused on customer service. Rather drive an extra two miles and go to that one instead.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This has to have been the worse service ever. Not only did I come in around lunch time rush I had to wait 10min for orange chicken. & the manager Mary was so rude & more concerned with fixing her own lunch bowl then the line of 6 or more customers waiting.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place got me badly sick! Don't come here.  I been scared to eat Chinese food. The food was not cooked at the right temperature . I was extremely sick.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">one star for the decent portion size.
I walked into two fat Mexican girls and some crazy Asian lady. The service was bad.. The two fat Mexican bitches really seemed like they didn't want to br there. Ordered the Angus steak that they charge an extra 1.25. Whatever.. I opened my plate and tried the steak.. For the extra money i had to pay, it tasted pretty bad. The steak bits were sauteed with all the tough ends of the asparagus and fibrous onion bits.. I
 was seriously disappointed..
also, fat Mexican girl, do they not teach you how to cut terriyaki chicken properly? please work on your knife skills 
also, to the owner, what the hell are you doing?!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was just in and spent $32 only to get home and find that no teriyaki sauce was inside for either of the 2 orders of Teriyaki chicken...Mary was so busy being concerned with what was going on behind her, I had to repeat my orders at least 2-3 times!!! What is wrong with customer service for the person you are servicing? I realize you were busy and the cook staff wasn't able to keep up with the customers ordering, but come on at least make sure the people filling the orders are making sure they have everything in the bad for each order before you hand the bag to the customer.  I had at least 3 or 4 people touch my order and not one of them managed to make sure I had my teriyaki sauce for my chicken.  I love Panda and Panda Express, but come on customer service do your job to make each customer feel like they are special and important and not like a cattle call where you can't wait to get the customers out of line.  I would  rather wait in line a little bit longer and get everything for my order and  feel like I was appreciated as a customer rather than a nuisance.

And come on..really upping your premium side like "Walnut chicken" to $1.25?? I mean come on it's not gold!

Unhappy Panda Express customer =( you get a fail in my book today but I decided to be nice since the food was delicious and fresh and give you 2 stars.  Had I been going on customer service only you would have gotten zero stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I use to eat here 1 or 2 times a week. I stopped going because I always had to wait for something to be cooked. Also they don't give you much food for the price. There are 2 other mom and pop Chinese food places around the corner that are a better bargin<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Idiots who can't follow basic directions; especially after you repeated your order to them three times and they still screw it up.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Horrible customer service. If it's anywhere near closing and they've run out of what you want, don't expect them to make any more. You'll be stuck with what they have.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good panda express with lot of quantity unlike the one in CSUF where they give way less to you. 

Overall good<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ugh. Again. I'd been on a five year hiatus ( food poisoning from a different branch threw me in a way only people who've had food poisoning know ) from all Pandas before my GF had a hankering and I wasn't about to try and change her mind. The food is bland and overpriced but that's any mass chain for you. But this one had no choices, serving sizes were Really bad, the place looked a mess and the employees obviously hated their jobs. To top it all of my GF, who likes panda, was picking through her bowl in disgust. Thank you for another reminder why I don't eat here.
Fyi- Jimmy Johns is across the street just opened up and they're awesome and always running a special. Also if your close and want Chinese there's a hole in the wall a block west on Orangethorpe and Euclid in the Southeast corner next to Larrys. Still not top quality but its tasty tasty for sure andthe prices and portions rock.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">WORST CHINESE FOOD EVER!!
I'm already pregnant, tired and hungry, but this place went out of their way to make me absolutely miserable.
First, I'm standing in line to use the restroom.  The door is locked.  There are no signs on the door.  I wait 5 minutes.  A worker exciting the store saw me standing there and says, "the key is by the register".  I say, "oh, I need a key?  There is no sign here saying I need a key to use the restroom."  I assumed it was occupied if it was locked.  Already wasted 5 minutes of my time.
Then the line to order food is horrifically long, at least 15 minutes wait time.  But whatever I'm hungry.  They have only 2 people working behind the counter during dinner rush hour, and they are terribly inefficient, getting orders mixed up, and can't restock food items fast enough.  If I want broccoli beef, I'm going to have to wait another 5 minutes they say.  So, I waited 5 minutes for an empty bathroom, 15 minutes to order my food, and now you want me to wait another 5 minutes??  Are you crazy?  No way!
I paid extra for a side "Angus beef steak", and they gave me the smallest portion ever... Not even a whole spoon scoop full.  My chow mein noodles were burnt and tasted smoky gross.  My orange chicken was soggy cold and not fresh.  And my egg roll tastes like a hot dog.
This place should be avoided at all costs.  I'm NEVER coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What is the point on saying you open at 10 when I had to wait 15 for my teriyaki chicken and another 5 min for my sauce. Really?  Wait 20 min for food that should be done when you open.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Picked up Panda Express for lunch yesterday. Been passing by here for years. Now I know why, this food sucks!   Now I know why no one has ever reviewed it.

ORDERED:
2 Item combo ... Beijing Beef, Orange Chicken with noodles and rice.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/panda-express-restaurant-fullerton?select=8PmfRvpotbF4IwStBW_TPA#8PmfRvpotbF4IwStBW_TPA

TASTE:
Beijing Beef ... very chewy must have been sitting for a while 1*star
Orange Chicken ...  OK but was a bit weak on the orange 2**Stars
Rice  .... Dry and flavorless, tossed after 2 bites 1* Star
Noodles ... OK but wouldn't go out of my way for em 2** Stars

Girl at the counter was nice but don't make up for lame food.

I Will not be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place always takes care of me after Church at The Rock down the street. They are  always so nice and the food is ALWAYS fresh. This is definitely the best Panda out of them all. I go there every week like clockwork and the new honey chicken is fantastic!! Enjoy everyone!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ugh every time we come here we get sick from it. I think we finally learned our lesson this time and will not be returning. Their food must be old or not properly cooked or something. 

Avoid if you want to function after eating.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They served two people behind me before me and I had to wait 15 minutes longer because they were out of what I ordered BEFORE the two folks behind me. I'm keeping this short because I have a lot of bad words of like to say but this is a family website. Who does that? Not coming here again<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">How can this place be totally OUT of 5 items and down to the final scoop on 3 more????  I'm sitting here at noon, no big lunch rush to wipe out dishes.  What gives????

Update #1:

It's now 24 minutes into the lunch rush and 5 customers have been waiting off to the side for their selections to be cooked. 

One guy cooking.   The supervisor in the blue shirt cooked for 10 minutes but has disappeared.  One girl serving,  one at register, 8 people in line.  No one working in the dining area clearing,  wiping tables.
Still out of 4 selections.

Update #2
Second cook appears and cooks for 10 minutes.  Disappears.  Janvan, Mr. Blue shirt reappears and starts serving a few entrees after Maria takes order and does rice/noodles.  He disappears after 10 minutes.  Reappears after 10 minutes and tells the hardest worker in the place Maria to go clean the dining area.  Janvan should do that since he only seems to know slow speed.  He enjoys looking out the windows a lot. He starts serving customers.

10 people still in line. Still out of two items.  People still have had to wait off to the side for items to be cooked.

Other hard workers are the cashier Corina and the short, hefty cook who hasn't stopped working hard the entire time I've been here, about 1 hour. 

Something is still way wrong at this Panda. I've been to lots of Pandas but never seen one so poorly staffed and run especially at lunch time. Are you listening Panda management?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the best panda express around. They give the biggest portions compared to other panda express. I love the sweet fire chicken. 
They do tend to be busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait, but it is worth it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have no idea how a dish can be on the main board and not titled as optional and not be served. After standing in line during rush lunch hour and I ask for eggplant tofu and I get a casual "sorry we don't have that" by their manager Annamaria.  Who had a very unapologetic tone. She was not very articulate in explaining why something would not be available on a certain day but is available on another day. They just take things off their menu without a warning and to be honest it is alway in demand despite not being a meat item.  I got a lot of illogical explanation. I am not going here again. Waste of my lunch hour<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't usually go to fast food chain for Chinese since I have so many great whole in the wall authentic Chinese restaurants by me but we had a free surf & turf single serving.  I was pleasantly surprised!!  I thought the shrimps were good size and the flavor was great.   

I also did a kids meal which the manager frowned upon but you know what, deal with it.  I didn't want a large meal so I got what I wanted.  I liked having the veggie options instead of the rice or noodles.  And I also tried the chicken green beans, cooked well.  I was pleasantly surprised.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Had the orange chicken , Peaking Beef,  with brown rice , I picked the dishes as they were freshly cooked. The fresh taste is awesome. Used a lot of red chille sauce and this lit up the taste buds.
The food was awesome<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've come to an epiphany......  The Beijing Beef kicks Orange Chicken's ass.  It's true....   It is so damn good.  The beef is crispy tossed in a sweet sauce with a tiny bit of heat.  I'm drooling now just reminiscing about it.  Get the Orange Chicken as the 2nd item and it's win-win!

FYI... employees here are so nice.  My wife and I walked in the door and were treated like royalty.  Why can't all places take this same approach to customer service?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I come here all the time and I really like this panda; they always offer samples which is awesome because in the 4 years I've eaten at a ton of different panda locations,not one place has asked me if I wanted samples. I didn't even know they gave out any! 
Anyways I was here today and usually they never make me wait for anything but I guess a lot of people were here and they were out of two things I wanted so I decided to wait. What I really liked is that when I went to pay the cashier attending me gave me a free drink because we decided to wait :) which was nice. The only thing I could complain about is certain people who work there are always rushing me to choose what i want or if I ask for more than one sample :/ but other than that I really love coming here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They always cheat you from your portions!!!!!!!!  I don't see myself eating at any Panda Express.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Panda is actually better than any Panda restaurant in Honolulu.  The taste the freshness and friendly staff are awesome.  Believe me I've been to all Honolulu Pandas so I know.  Go figure in Fullerton. Good job guys and gals.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a good panda to go to it is always busy so you know the food is fresh and not been in the warmers to long. The down side is if the food runs low you might have to wait longer for your order till they catch up. But as I said that makes it fresh. It is amazing that the Pandas here are better them in Honolulu.  Who ever is cooking for them must know what the word "flavor" means because the ones in Honolulu don't have any.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food and overall service is generally good but I just went while they were busy and they forgot one of my entrees and gave me little of anything else. Not a huge deal but a fair warning to anyone going whole they are busy, double check your order before you leave.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Manager here is awesome. Noticed that they had skimped on my chow mein and my entree choices. I didnt even have to say anything, the manager checks each as it comes down the lane, sent it back and had them fill it properly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If it isn't for the fact this is the closest Panda Express near where I live, I probably wouldn't bother coming here.  Service here can be pretty  inconsistent.  On a good day, service may be good and the staff may give you a fair portion of what you paid. 

On a BAD day.... you get staffs that likes to skimp and give you barely enough of an entree.  That's what happened to me today. Today is Sunday and this place is ridiculously packed !!  There were like 3 servers on the food line and the 1st lady (American gal) seems pretty nice and doesn't skimp, but she was only at the beginning of the line.  She was pretty nice and even told me I can just take my time in deciding what i want, and just tell the 2nd lady when I'm ready (while she proceeds to serve the next guest). 

The 2nd staff  (old Chinese lady) who worked at the main section of the food line.... skimped.....  

Previously I asked the 1st staff if they are making a new fresh batch of mushrm. chicken, she said yes. I told her I'll wait.  After she volley me to the 2nd staff, whom ignored what just happened and scoop the old batch before I can really say anything....and even skimp on it.... I left the store with a pretty bad taste.  I didn't want to make a big fuss, cause there was a large line of ppl still waiting behind me, but this is definitely a HUGE turn off for me and I pretty much am force to deduct a star for them on yelp. 

the only thing Panda express is generous about in any given location is the amount of chow-mein they can cram in the box, so they don't need to put as much entree. 


[Conclusion]
If you want to gamble on service or don't mind being skimped on, then sure, give this place a try.  Otherwise, i think the La Habra location may be better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Maybe there is something to the idea that this Panda is better than most. Here's my data point. A couple weeks ago we stopped here and I got sweet fire chicken as one of my entrees. It was really great - lightly breaded and fried, fresh tasting, with a nice level of spice and fresh pineapple. Today I happened to go to the Panda on Katella in Anaheim and get the same dish. I was served hard, chewy nodules with lots of onions not much flavor and no appearance of pineapple. It was 11 AM so the food shouldn't have been old - unless they served me yesterday's leftovers. I'll have to try the Fullerton one next time and see if it's consistently good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really enjoy Panda Express but this location just didn't do it for me. The food tasted cold and old. The service was horrible...too much in a rush to listen to you, even when you're the only one ordering and no one is behind you. I asked for orange chicken and he gave me some other kind of chicken and when I tried to say I didn't want that and that I wanted orange chicken, he simply left what he gave me on the plate and added orange chicken. Asshole! The cashier was a bitch! Got mad because I asked for soy sauce...how about you offer us some instead of assuming we don't want any and you won't be asked for it...and I saw others asking for it as well! Ugh! Not coming here again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yes 4 stars.  Why?  3 words.  Shanghai Angus Steak.  Man it was delicious.  Tender meat, juicy, and the veggies were 2 of my very favorites.  You cannot go wrong with mushrooms and asparagus.  Mmmmm mmmmm good.  Also that sauce is really good too, the description says it's an Asian steak sauce and I hope they bottle it cuz I would buy it.  

I got a two item with string bean chicken, 1/2 steamed rice and 1/2 freshly woked up veggies.  They must of just had a rush because everything in my combo was hot, with crisp colorful veggies and good sauces.  I kept looking around the restaurant telling my boyfriend, "I don't think we're in Panda anymore".  

Service was nice enough, i didn't feel rushed and they welcomed us as we came in.  She offered up plenty of hot sauce, mustard and soy sauce and she even gave me a side of mandarin sauce which I love to put on my rice.  All in all it was a successful trip to a chain fast food place.  Thank you Panda for making my Sunday great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I know, I know...FIVE STARS FOR A PE?! I must be crazy, right? For once, I think not. 

I came here on a whim, looking for some cheap grub on my way to the local piano bar, and despite my gut feeling (and my bf), we decided to dine here. Now, I've been to my fair share of PE's and I was never impressed...but here? Friendly staff was a good start. Food? Whoever the cooks are, deserve a raise in pay. The fried rice is good and even though I'm not usually a fan, I've been nomming on the broccoli beef. I don't normally eat broccoli, but it's just so good!! And of course I have to top it off with the cream cheese ragoons! If you aren't ordering these, you're missing out! Overall, this Panda Express has exceeded my expectations and has set the bar for all other locations. It's a little bit of a drive for me for something fast, but I'm willing to do it for this particular branch. DE-LISH!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not many choices, seems like they are skimping on the portions. O well Don't really care for big chain restaurants. Need some good Chinese food in Fullerton, the one that was ok next to Ralph's is gone. Just going to go stick with Thai Basil or go to Westminster for authentic Chinese.<p>

</p></p><p itemprop="description">My parents brought food from this Panda Express. I've tried there broccoli and beef and it wasn't that good, it left an after taste in my mouth. So I decided to not eat any more and my mom are the rest, both of my parents had gotten food poisoning from this place! I didn't even want to give this place a one star but I did just to write my review.<p>

</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ok I'm reviewing Panda Experss.  I know...I know..not exactly newsworthy.  Let's keep this simple.

This has got to be one of, if not, the busiest PE in their chain.  I've just about always had an excellent experience.  Food is always reliable and service is typically exceptional and right on point....swift, accurate, and bam bam bam.  I like that.

I've catered from here as well and this experience wasn't perfect but I have to admit it wasn't terrible.  There's always something to nit pick about if you're a winey brat.  :)

PS - Have you ever noticed your receipt?  I use it regularly now.  All you do is take your receipt, log onto their website, answer a handfull of questions and on your next visit you get a free entree with your 2 item order.  A 3 item for the price of a 2 item.  It's only a difference of $1.25 but it feels good to get something right?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Skimpy portions compared to all other Panda Express locations. Their food is typical fast Chinese food, but nothing exceptional.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">HORRIBLE guest service they told me to microwave the food at home because it was served cold and refused to make more even though they still had 15 minutes til close!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Panda express always hits the spot for me. Its true its not authentic Chinese but I don't care. It tastes good and is filling. The only thing thats annoying is the $1 extra charge for premium items. And this Pand Ex can be stingy with the walnut shrimp. Its usually pretty clean here though and the workers are friendly. The gf liked the shanghai steak so I tried it too and it was pretty good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I live in the area me and my boyfriend are in an out of this place constantly because our love of Chinese food. The service  is always ridiculous there either super pushy or just straight up excuse my language bitches. I understand we came in a little bit before they close (25mins) but that does not give them the right to be extremely rude for starters I know when the customer ask for something they are out of they just remake it she refused to ask the chef to remake two things my boyfriend order and said what they have out is what they have while looking back at the cook an smiling and the proceeded to remind us a few times they close at 10 which i knew because its plastered on the front door and i live in the area i know when everything is closed,I am not an incompetent person and it was sad she took me as one. This is the last time we will be coming to this Panda Express its not worth the time or money for such rude service management really needs to step it up!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">No matter what time of the day it is, Panda Express is always fantastic. Yes some people will call it "fake chinese food" but I could care less. It is fast, cheap, and taste great. The employees are always very nice and helpful.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I give u 5 stars just because of the girl working their with the blonde hair today working her buns off.  Most fo your staff was standing around while there wa s ahuge line forming, and this girl was working so hard yet still giving each customer excellent attention.  I wish the rest of your staff was haleping out and not leaving it all on her shoulders. Awesomne work girl!  The food was one of the better experiences ive had from Panda Express.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's super busy at lunchtime but food is always fresh and the friendly staff busts-butt to keep the line moving.

The large amounts of rice and noodles can make the meat  portion to appear small but the portion size is on par with every other Panda Express and Pick Up Stix I've gone to.  I just ask for half the amount of starch and its still more than enough food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location doesn't exist!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went here for a family dinner we were excited to see a lot of people in line for food however when I ordered they gave small portions of everything and once we got back home food didn't seem like it was fresh and the orange chicken was very crunchy<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really like this location and their service.  The foods are fresh and is the best Panda that I had.  I tried already so far 7 Pandas :-) The walnut shrimps are very fresh and they gave me a good portion.  For sure, I'll come back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yes, I am giving 5 stars, why not? 

After all, panda express food is the same but the employees are so wonderful. They are so nice, greet you right as you come in and offer samples right away. Every time I go,  I always get a sample of the walnut shrimp =) They are not stingy with the servings and the place is kept clean. Not very crowded, if lines are long, they seem to move fast. Oh and if you go there really late, about 20 minutes before closing and if they are out of a side,  they will make a fresh serving just for you if you ask them =) , there not like other Panda express where  they say sorry this is all we have and no we wont make orange chicken for you. They recently just added 2 flavors of slushies. I think one is pineapple  and orange and the other is cherry with pomegranate? I dont remember but there pretty tasty.  My favorite panda express to go to!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you've been to any Panda Express, the one in Fullerton is just like the others. The restaurant is clean. The staff is friendly and competent and the food is good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst food on the planet... even worse than McDonalds or Burger King. Stay out of any of their restaurants. It's cheap unhealthy crap they use to make the meals.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i just dont get why people love Panda so much??

its really not good

if youre going to eat something...eat it right

thats why if i want american i go to mcdonalds and if i want chinese fast food...i save money to eat chinese how its meant to be eaten<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I once went into a Panda...and it had a little sign that said if you want your food fresh, just ask us and we'll make it.  So, every time I go into a Panda and the food is dried out and old looking, I ask for it to be made fresh.  This happens 1 out of 10 times because I usually visit during peak hours.  

However, Panda looked so good as I was in the parking lot of this Fullerton shopping center.  It was after 9pm, but I knew I had to have some.   I asked for fresh Beijing Beef.  What was there was lacking any curb appeal.  The lady got really defensive saying it was just made and made me try it.  It tasted OK, but I knew with its crusty old look, it had been sitting there for longer than my liking.  The tangy taste is sooooo good when fresh, and you can't beat it.
So, after they refused to make any fresh, I said OK, I guess I'll take that since you're not going to make me any more.  The girl checking me out said that they would have made me more if it was earlier in the day, but they were trying to sell what they had as to not waste food.  REALLY PANDA?  You mean, you'd force me to take your crusty old Beiing Beef in the name of cutting your waste, instead of making a whole 3 ozs of the stuff fresh for me, since I requested that?  
Biggest customer service fail ever.  I filled out your survey when I got to the car, but wasn't able to give an accurate take of your customer service fail.   I won't be coming to your location again, unless you offer me a fresh serving of Beiing Beef - what I wanted in the first place.  

I hear Chick-Fil-A opened across the street from you today.  That's some stiff fast food competition for you my friends.    I will patronize Chick-fil-A instead, since their customer service is AMAZING.  I can give up my once in a while Beijing Beef craving for chicken nuggets and buffalo sauce any time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Orange chicken and panda beef is very good. If are looking for a decent amount of food and don't want to get the 2 item, I would get the panda bowl. The panda bowl you get chow mein or rice and 1 entree. It's 5.50 and some change. Very nice location and service is always good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So i paid 7 dollars for the shrimp walnut glazed and there was only 4 pieces of shrimp.  One word: rip off.<p>
