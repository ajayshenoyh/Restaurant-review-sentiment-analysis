<p itemprop="description">First time at a Pieology and it was great. 
Had myself a pizza with mozzarella and parmesan cheese, red sauce, pepperoni, bacon, grape tomatoes and green bell peppers along with a cinnamon strips.
Both were great and promptly made.

Will be back soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Although the store was 2/3rds empty, ordering was very slow. 

They're out of basil AGAIN! To make the matter worse, they're ALSO OUT OF CHICKEN!!! Bummer I came here thinking of having their buffalo chicken pizza and my wife wanted a salad. No wonder this place has less and less people every time we come here. We might just stop coming here as well. Very disappointing. 

We ordered 3 pizzas all together, one of them came out almost 10 min. later than the other ones. with no bbq sauce on a bbq pizza. And the girl who took it out seemed like she could care less. Our neighboring table received someone else's pizza. Not a single apology, no customer service whatsoever to speak of! What's going on here!!?? Only reason I rated two stars instead of one was because the lady in charge of the dough/cheese/sauce was very friendly. My recent dining experiences here has been close to unforgivable repeatedly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went here for the first time today my aunt wanted to try it and I am glad she did . The service here was pretty good fast and efficient and a really kind staff . This place is also really staffed good in my opinion lots of help . 

The location is nice inside pretty big and it had a good amount of seating . The parking lot  is small tho so you might have to park away from the business . I would say it's a little loud but way more quite than blaze pizza . 

I like the food here they have really good dough and toppings very fresh and great tasting !! I had a pizza with chicken , meatball, ham , sausage  and all the topping tasted really good way better quality than other pizza places . I also noticed there pizza was not greasy at all witch I like . They also have the dole whip  it is a must try its just as good as the one at Disneyland  I suggest you try it .  This is a great all around pizza place I will be back to try more .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Create your own pizza is fun & tasty.  There are also "house flavors", such as chicken chili verde, I really like the tangy green sauce with taste of sprinkled cilantro, it's like an open face enchilada.  But they put on to much sour cream (just look at the picture),  that overwhelmed the whole thing.
I still recommend chicken chili verde but ask them to tone down the sour cream.  The pizza is on the wet side because of all the sauce, kinda messy and I had a mountain of napkins on the table afterward.
Friendly, helpful staff.  Pizzas came out fairly quick, around 10 minutes after you paid.  Clean, roomy eatery, lots of seating.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology recently introduced 2 new Southwest pizzas: 
- the Chicken Chile Verde, made of green enchilada sauce, red peppers, green chiles, cilantro onion, chicken, topped with green sour cream and
- the Spicy Southwest, made of red enchilada sauce, mozzerella / cheddar cheese, red peppers, jalapenos, cilantro, chicken, and red sour cream.

They also introduced a new dessert pizza: the Chocolate Chip Churro, which is a pizza with cinnamon, Ghiradelli's chocolate chips, drizzled with gooey sweet condensed milk.  

We decided to try all 3 "as is" with no modification.  The pizzas were much better than I thought.  The Chile Verde was tangy but had just a slight kick.  The sour cream really added that nice tang and the ingredients were not too overwhelming.  

The Spicy Southwest had a kick to it, and I think next time I'd skip the jalapenos and substitute it with corn to add a sweetness to it.  

The dessert pizza was sweet, as it should be.  A little slice went a long way for me, so it you want something to "cleanse" your palate, this dessert pizza can easily accommodate more than 4 people. 

Overall 3 good pizzas. If you don't want to "build your own", this is a good alternative to the ordinary pizza. 

In addition to the dessert pizza, Fullerton introduced Dole Whip in 2 flavors: Pineapple and Strawberry.  The feedback has been positive, and manager Alexandria said their other locations may soon be offering it for the summer.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My first time here and the food was amazing! Really loved the concept. I stopped by here for lunch and was in a rush. I was afraid the pizza wouldn't be done fast enough. Usually it takes at least 10 minutes to make pizza at Domino's or Pizza Hut. But no, not here! It takes 3 minutes to cook the pizza. Yes, you heard me right... 3 MINUTES! So awesome. 

The restaurant is structured as a line up, order, pay, then sit down type of place. (think Chipotle). The line goes pretty fast. I decided to get the Meat Lovers Pizza. It has pepperoni, sausage and meatballs with cheese and sauce. I added bacon, extra cheese, spinach, red onions, and yellow peppers (at no extra charge). Again, much like Chipotle, you go down the food line to create your meal.  

They brought out the pizza to my table. Very friendly and upbeat service! Everyone was so nice. The pizza tasted as good as it looked! I really enjoyed it and it was fast and easy to make. You can create your own pizza, whether it be light & healthy, scrumptious, or gooey; the ingredients are fresh and quality. What more can you ask for? Definitely will be back again to try more. Oh, and you can request sauces on the side. The BBQ sauce and pesto sauce are great for dipping!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I mean with so many make your own pizza places opening up the competition is stiff.  Pieology always takes the crown for me being the OG of make your own pizza.  So on this particular day I had some OG pizza with my OG friend Jenn.  We had just finished getting boba which took about 15 minutes longer than I had anticipated.  By the end we were starving and pieology was perfectly located near it.

Came through and its pretty much a simple concept.  You pick either from the menu of pizzas they have available or you can be creative and make your own.  You can't really go wrong with either in my opinion on the simple fact that pieology has the best ingridients hands down.  So we ended up picking up two delicious pies, paid and grabbed a table to devour the delicious pizzas.  Pizza here is top notch in my opinion.  I love pizza and this is probably my favorite make your own pizza joint.

Service was friendly, the decor was nice and the place was spacious enough where we could just hang, eat pizza and chit chat.  Yes lines can get super long here but they do go by very quickly thanks to the service.  It doesn't take that long for them to make your pizza either.  Overall, I'd definitely return again.  I've been going to Blaze a lot prior to this and the comparison is not even close.  Sure blaze is good and all but Pieology easily takes the number 1 spot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place and need to go back ASAP! The first time I had a Pieology was after moving from Vegas to Orange County. I didn't go to the restaurant: a friend did and she brought me back a pie of my own. 

It was amazing...and at the time, I wasn't sure if it was amazing because I had been moving and was starving, or if it genuinely was a great pie. 

So the first chance I had to go myself, I did, and it was even more amazing because I was able to see how it all goes down.

The Pieologists make your pizza for you while you watch: they press the dough, add the sauce of your choice, then assemble the toppings to your liking. Then the pie is put into the oven and you await your creation.

The result is an amazing pie with a perfect crust, all the right toppings you wished for, and mouthwatering good taste. The ingredients are fresh and the employees are super friendly. Pieology is definitely a favorite place to eat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Finally the answer to my GLUTEN FREE pizza woes. making my own pie crust is fun but sometimes, i just don't wanna. THANK YOU THANK YOU pieology for maknig a GF pizza worth eating. the crust is fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. can't even tell its a special dough. there are many cheeses to choose from, all of them are so good! all the the toppings are delicious and it's so much fun watching the servers fill up your pie with whatever you want, however much you want. my favorite are the sauces at the end. nothing like topping a veggie and multi meat pie with delicious pesto sauce. my friends know to watch their hands when i'm eating my pie!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology pizza is by far my favorite build your own pizza restaurant. I love all the choices for the toppings, butter, dough, herbs, vegetables, fruits, meats, cheese, and much more. They also have salad. The drink selection is great. I love that the pizza is always ready in under 5 minutes. They even have dessert pizza. This place is top quality. I recommend getting One pizza with Herb butter then red sauce then add lots of cheese (as much as you want) after that get some vegetables and fruit next get meat and then more cheese on top of everything. After the pizza I recommend either a medium fountain drink, a horizon milk, or apple juice. When you are done with the pizza, I recommend trying the cinnamon sugar dessert pizza. I highly recommend coming here for great food, great service, and a fun time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology Pizzeria is a cool spot to come to where you can personalize your own pizza, who wouldn't love that! They have an array of toppings, that include different types of sauces, cheeses, veggies, meat and fruit. Did I mention that they have Dole whip soft serve, yummy! 

The pizza is thin crust and a pretty good size, you can either share one or if your really hungry you can eat one on your own. I ate one on my own, it was that good :). The pizza is ready in just a few minutes, which is awesome! The place was pretty clean with plenty of seating inside. I would most certainly come back again whenever I'm in the OC.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yipee, for me! I finally made it to Pieology! It was worth the wait (I live nearby in Placentia, but just hadn't ventured out that way, down Chapman). 
My friend and I agreed on a late lunch and arrived at 3 PM, Monday. We were lucky to have chosen that time and it being MLK Day. No line. My friend has gone numerous times and instructed the Pieology virgin I was, on how to order and some specifics. 
I didn't think to get the whole wheat crust, but will next time. Instead I had white and then copied his version with Herb Sauce and Mozzarella first. I then chose sun dried tomatoes, chicken, artichokes, pineapple, and basil. 
The pizza cooked so fast! It was insanely delicious. Boy toy also ordered the dessert they make. It's cinnamon sugar with icing drizzled on top. I ate my whole pizza and then a slice of that. Heaven. 
I'll definitely return soon and am already planning my next order!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really had high hopes for this place, but they were not met. I really was hoping for better. The service was rushed, and the pizza was not cooked enough. I felt like Blaze Pizza does a way better job because they offer a thicker crust, more attention to detail, more cooking time, more flavorful meats, sauteed onions, roasted garlic, spicy red sauce, and better service overall. I love Blaze Pizza, and I am sorry I betrayed Blaze Pizza. Ugh forgive me Blaze I'll be back soon because of this unfortunate transgression on my part. Step it up Pieology.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Subway/Chipotle for Pizzza!

I like this place a loooooooot.

Although I do wish that they  had sliced tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes, and fresh garlic instead of the pre minced one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location is conveniently placed in between several schools and next to other eateries so people have an option to not eat the same thing all the time.

There aren't any other pizza places too close by so this is a good location for something that is delicious and inexpensive.

This location is very similar to other Pieology locations and it's very clean and pretty much similar to chipotle. 

The employees here are suuuper nice. Almost all of them asked me how I was doing just in passing. I was standing next to the soda fountain and an employee just walked up and asked me how I was like they genuinely cared and then walked away after I answered. Unfortunately that type of encounter is not common anywhere.

The manager also came around while my group and I were eating to ask if we needed anything and also told us about their email club. I may not join, but the gesture was still appreciated.

I would definitely return to this location in the future.


#63/100<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My first time here after my boyfriend has been trying to get me to go for the love of pizza.

I wasn't disappointed! The way it's set up is like Chipotle and there were a lot of choices to choose from (sauces, toppings, proteins, etc). The pizza only took about 5 minutes to cook and it was a good size for unlimited toppings.

For the price and the amount of food I get on my personal pizza, I love it and would definitely come back again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good Concept, I owed a deli with the same concept a few years back.

Works very well.

Also the place has terrible acoustics, sound is bouncing all over this place.

Very noisy and they just turn up the sound louder and louder till you are just shouting when you talk.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm a picky pizza eater and this place is good. Our family's favorite craft pizza. 
Why? Everyone in the family gets to make their own pizza with anything they want on it.
Always a line at night.
4:44 pm on Saturday NO LINE

Lesson learned. Come early<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like these places where everyone can get what they want. It satisfies picky eaters. And no one has to settle. Pieology is great because the toppings are unlimited. Everything was fresh, tasted great and was quickly served to our table. I love the variety of toppings and being able to get something different since it is all yours. No one would eat my all veggie pizza. 

The only complaint is the place is really loud. Chairs that scrape and squawk on a cement floor coupled with loud music and a interior with no noise reduction features, created a meal where you can't talk during the meal when it is busy. And it was busy. We pretty much hurried up and ate, which might be their goal. Get you in and out fast! 

Good food - loud place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't order online for the City of Industry location!  They had no idea we ordered and paid online, they didn't know they even took online payments and ordering.  Now we can't call a company to release their charges because when I arrived to get the order it was too busy to make my order in less than another hour!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is always packed since it's right near the college. The service is quick and there is plenty of seating. I've been to this location several times and no complaints. This build your own pizza is simply amazing cause they aren't stingy when adding how many toppings; just keep adding as much as you want. The food comes out nice and hot! Soo good! The only draw back from this location is that it's hard finding parking cause there are other food places within the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went in for lunch and was deliciously impressed. Great service, the pizzas were awesome, not heavy, light and hearty with tons of flavor. Their cheese was so stringy I lived it. My son was ready for a second pie as was I. 

Great place for a quick custom pizza. Their effort was felt though the satisfaction of my belly!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Pieology, especially this location. I've never had a bad experience here. The only thing that came close was the one time where the line was so long that it went around the restaurant and through the back exit door and I had to wait in line next to the ramen place next door, but that shows how good this place is. I like how you can have your pizza your way. The cinnamon dessert is also something that I highly recommend. The staff here are really courteous and helpful, the atmosphere is very chill, and parking isn't bad at all since it's in a shopping center parking lot. I definitely recommend this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Was starving and in area. This place is a copy and paste of Blaze without the Blood Orange Lemonade.

Ordered a sausage meatball red pepper onion basil extra cheese on red classic sauce. Not bad.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't usually go out and order pizza, or customize my own. So when I hear you can customize your own pizza at a fixed price. I had to come and check it out.

For starters, the interior design is really modern. First seeing how cozy and warm it is even though the windows are open and dark. So lots of fresh air! When ordering your own pizza, the service was great and kind, always moving along to the next person and shooting out orders one after another.

Receiving the pizza was a different story i did not expect. They come out and deliver it to you with smiles, and nice way of telling us to enjoy our great meal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can't really go wrong with Pieology. The pricing is great, especially if you share it! If you are going to share, you can split the pizza and customize half the pizza with your preferences. Of course, don't go into Pieology expecting a thick or stuffed pizza crust. Their "pie" crust is on the thinner style, very similar to a flat bread. The fact that you can fully customize your pizza with your choice of sauce, cheese, and toppings makes this location a great option for lunch or dinner. Service is always quick, so definitely be prepared to order. Don't be the one person that stalls the line with all sorts of questions, they have menus towards the start of the line.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pretty disappointed to visit this location and find that every single empty table was very dirty. One even had hair on it to go with all the food left behind. It was less than half full with the staff waiting to help people behind the glass so I'm not sure why the tables were neglected.  Management should make sure the team is taking the initiative to clean tables during their down time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a great concept! Building your own pizza is as American as it gets.

The pizza crust itself is a nice and thin crust. You can customize everything about your pizza from the sauce all the way to the toppings. All in all a great place to eat. You can order 1 pizza and share amongst friends. 1 pizza can feed 2-3 people.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place :) Service is awesome 90% of the time and their thin crust has never disappointed me. I usually get the alfredo chicken with a lot of veggies and with the exception of maybe two times they grunted and showed disapproval for my request to add extra alfredo and mozarella, everyone working has been more than excellent in service. They're also never out of seats as the restaurant is big and roomie.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is very delicious. You decide what you want on your pizza. Unlimited toppings for the same price. I was helped out by alfredo and carlos, very friendly guys. I Really do recommend this place. Im definitely coming back here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best pizza ever. Being able to choose what you want on your pizza makes it better. All ingredients look fresh and was cooked just right.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious made to order pizza with super fresh ingredients. 

Pies are pricey, so heads up on that.

Workers assisting customers from behind the counter along the assembly line all need to speak up since the acoustics in this restaurant are really really bad as there is nothing made of fabric or otherwise soft in the entire restaurant to absorb sound.. 

Plus, The floors are cement and the chairs are metal so with all the people pulling in their chairs or pushing them out And this location is always busy to boot. . .. . . I literally had to say  "what?" at least two different times to each employee I had contact with along the assembly line. 

By the time I got to the cash register I was really frustrated.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Place is great but always has a long line. Also when there is online orders you have to wait for them to finish all of them before you can order which was annoying because I was with a group of people and got split up and they had to wait because they were paying. Other than that, the food was really good and came out pretty quick<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is pretty decent. Though I prefer Blaze Pizza bc it's leaner. I'm not a huge fan of pizza and I've only been here a few times with friends. However, I love that we can customize the toppings. Of course, I'd make my pizza the spiciest pizza possible.

The service was quick and efficient, and for the most part, the staff is polite. Though once a staff member got annoyed when I asked for BBQ sauce. 

The downside is that there are never enough tables. During lunch times, you may have no choice but to take your pizza to-go.<p>

My return to Pieology after our 5 months of separation. Wild Thoughts run through my mind as I try to remember what the last slice I ate tasted like. Orders up, food has arrived and i sit stagnant as i stare at what I have wanted for months, and what competing places couldn't replicate. First tear of the first slice proved to be the deciding factor. Unprepared for the alterations they have clearly made to their pizza, I dive into the first bite. Hard crust?!?! What the hell is that. It was like eating a cracker, and not crust. Everything about their pizza seemed to have changed. I don't mind change, I just don't like to be around when it happens. I wish I was around when this one happened so I could promptly tell them to not do it. I doubt that i would give this a second chance after this big of a let down. Sad end to my relationship with this location. Blaze Pizza, save me a seat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been coming here since I got to school at CSUF. It's like a subway for PIZZA!! $9 thin crust pizza for as many toppings as you like.

I did come here once and they messed up on my pizza twice. I was lowkey disappointed but they remade my pizza, gave me one of the mess up pizzas, and gave a coupon for another free pizza. I didn't mind the wait since I had no where to go. Great staff and customer service. 

The line is always usually long, but it's totally worth it. 
Oh, and don't forget to order to cinnamon sticks for dessert! Sooo yummy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the second time to this pieology. both visits were great! the pizza is so fresh and cooked fairly fast. the place is always clean and the service is always good. What a great concept. All you want on your pizza for under $8.00.   I recommend this pieology to everyone!! This is a great place!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried a lot of the pizza (you make it yourself) Mod Pizza, Fired Pie, but Pieology just slays it.  Always a great greeting by the staff.  Fresh ingredients, how you want it.  Crust is cooked perfectly every time.  Easily the best $8.50 you can spend on a pie...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">VEGANS: so we entered today and we asked for the wheat pizza crust with red sauce and vegan cheese, I was a little worried cause the sauce had pieces of cheese in it (that falls in) to my surprise they have a separated container with sauce! the vegan cheese is covered and the guys changed their gloves!! So happy with the service!!
They have a lots of veggies that you will enjoy! :) 

The crust is super thin and the pizza taste really good!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here a few times. I actually try to avoid this place during packed hours because it takes a long time! It's not because of the employees, they are fast, but people can't seem to make up their damn mind while they're in line. 

It gets really back up when people reach the veggie section, people are like I want this uhmmmm 30 secs later oh and that and it causes a ripple effect. Out of the courtesy of others, write down or type out on your phone what you want. 

The price is pretty decent, it's like $8 for the pizza and with a drink it's about $10. They have plenty of sauces and a different variety of options. 

The girl dropped my card while she was sliding it. That kinda annoyed me but hahaha mistakes happen. 

Parking can suck, so prepare to be driving around during busy hours. Everyone is pretty nice and the place is pretty clean. It's a great place to eat, not the best but it's definitely one of its kind in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Still love this place! The pizza is good and the service is always beyond excellent! Had a small incident with too much salt added  the manager , Mira, quickly addressed my concern, she fixed the problem promptly and made sure I was happy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fresh ingredients! Thin crust! Great service! Delicious! Make your pizza your way! I love the thin crust as it lets your ingredients shine and you are not full from the dough. Did I mention they make the dough right there! FRESH!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay this Pieology is the best one on the planet!!!
The staff and food here are the best! 
Sometimes things happen but luckily Gabe was working and fixed our pizza! I left happy because my wife was happy!!! If the manager reads this please give Gabe a raise!!! This gentleman deserves it! He was genuinely concerned that we enjoyed our pizza! That made everything that much better! Thank you. JSSL<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As the last few reviews have stated, this place is literally the Chipotle or Subway of thin crust pizza. You can order one of their creations or you can start with a base pizza and add as many toppings as your heart desires and make your own. 

On my pizza, I literally put 3 different types of cheeses on it, every meat (pepperoni, sausage, meatball, bacon, ham...) and tons of veggies on it. I don't think you can mess up your own custom pizza. The only downfall is (probably because mine was way too overloaded) my crust wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it.

They also have a dessert cinnamon pizza sticks. This buttery cinnamon goodness is actually pretty good! Its like a thinner, less doughy cinnabun. Its worth a try. 

Lines are usually pretty short, but if you hit lunch/dinner time, the lines get kind of long. The line goes fast though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Now with Dole Whip! Once they figure out a more efficient Dole Whip line, this place will be perfect.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just Awesome!!!  I had mushrooms , garlic, pepperoni, sausage with white sauce.  Cooked to perfiction.  meaning crust was cooked all the way through.  did not come out soggy  like Blaze Pizza does.  Hopefully  pieology will come to Citrus Heights and Carmichael.  Also, customer  service was awesome too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pretty good. Not the best pizza I've had but not bad. I liked the fact that they had a gluten free version and that you can make your pizza just like you want it. The gluten free version tasted very similar to the normal one. Since its near a college it's always busy but the line moves fast.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is amazing! Love making my own pie! Come here all the time with my friends. Atmosphere is great and friendly. It's clean. Good music. Staff is amazing!! Clarissa is the best. She's so nice and helpful. 

Service is quicker than I expected. I was seated and in couple minutes, they brought my pizza out!

The pizza lab is great. That's their pre-made options. I love making my own. Pesto is so bomb! You can have that on the bottom or drizzled on the top. You can't get too much pesto! The meats are great. Bacon. Chicken. Pepperoni. Ugh!! Amazing!!! 

Great for groups! Definitely come back every week!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everyone here was super friendly and helpful! The pizza was really good. You get as many toppings as you want for one price. Plenty of options. The service was great and getting our food was fast. We will be coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can put ANYTHING on your pizza! I put chickpeas and ricotta cheese just because I CAN. Also if you like cinnamon sugar ask them to put it on the crust (as seen in my pic below). It's delicious and feels like dessert! Don't worry if the red sauce mixes with it still pretty dang good!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Fullerton Pieology was the first Pieology location I experienced. I think this was the first (of many to follow) "design-it-yourself" pizza experiences I had ... and yes, my experience at Pieology revolutionized the way I thought of "personal pizzas."
 
For just $7.50 (the price may have increased slightly by now), you could create your own pizza, choosing from Pieology's extensive assortment of sauces, toppings and premium toppings. For about the same price (at least, from what I can remember), you could opt for one of the pizza joint's pre-designed pizzas. I have eaten one of these thin-crusted pizzas entirely in one sitting before, but if you don't want to be too full, I would suggest eating half and saving half for later. However, these pizza pies are best straight out of the oven!
 
Of all the "DIY" pizza places I have been to--including Social Life Pizza, Blaze and The Pizza Studio--I think the pizzas at Pieology have been the crispiest. The boyfriend likes Pieology the best for this reason alone--the ingredients (especially the veggies) don't get too "watered down" on the pizza, making the crust soggy--whereas we've had soggier pizzas at some of the other places. Because I always overload my personal pizzas with cheese, however, I don't really mind if the crust isn't as crunchy. The Pieology pizzas are always crispy, though, no matter how much cheese I have on there. 
 
Every time I have gone to Pieology--to this location or to the one in Torrance--I always chose to create my own pizza. Here are some of the toppings I include:
 
Olive Oil/Herb Butter Base: Because I'm not a huge fan of tomato, this olive oil base sauce is perfect for me and features a buttery consistency.
 
Artichoke Hearts, Fresh Basil and Spinach: I'm pretty particular about my veggies, but I always throw these on my pizza, because it reminds me of the "White Pizza" that I always order from CPK.
 
Variety of Cheeses (Mozzarella, Ricotta, Parmesan and Gorgonzala): Since I'm paying a base price that includes all the toppings I want, I tend to go crazy when it comes to cheese ... and ask for every single cheese to be on my pizza (minus any premium ones).
 
Pepperoni, Sausage and Bacon: A good selection of meats are available as pizza toppings, but I don't stray too far from the classics. Sometimes I get one of these three meats, and if I've super hungry, I'll just get all of them. Sometimes, however, I'll just opt for a simple chicken-covered pizza (plus the veggies and cheese) and be done with my topping selection. I have yet to add the spicy chicken onto my pizza!
 
Pesto: At Pieology, you can choose from a small variety of "after bake" sauces to drizzle on your pizza after it comes out of the oven. So far, I've only tried the pesto, but the employee generously covered my pizza with it and it was really good! One of my friends always gets the BBQ sauce drizzled over his pizza, and his last pizza creation looked so good that I might add this sauce to my pizza next time. I also want to add black pepper and extra virgin olive oil onto my pizza during another visit. 
 
If I had to go with any of the signature pizza options, I would probably choose the #4, featuring mostly cheeses (Mozzarella, Parmesan, Ricotta, Fresh Basil, black pepper and olive oil). But since I get most of these toppings on my "create your own" pizza anyway, it just makes sense to create my own (and add other toppings that I want on there). 
 
This Fullerton Pieology has always been consistent in its performance (pizza quality has been the same) and its service (the pizzas come out pretty quickly). I've also noticed that this location is always the most crowded Pieology (compared to the Torrance and San Diego locations) I've always been to. Perhaps it's because this Pieology is the original location, or maybe Anaheim is just a great spot for this pizza joint. Whatever the case, I can always depend on the Fullerton Pieology for a great pizza meal at an unbeatable price.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Well I have to say this was a bit disappointing. I love pizza and build my own is my favorite however this place wasn't even very tasty and the customer service was the worst. Rude doesn't even begin to describe it. Stood at the register with our pizza waiting to be put in for 15min and the girl didn't even acknowledge us then the that rung us up was like a robot weird experience. I will stick with Blaze much better tasting and way better customer service<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Customer service is great!!!!! Got the wrong pizza, manager and staff made it right without any BS.. love it<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We've been coming here since they've opened. By far our favorite pieology location.  Food is always good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow, I cannot say enough great things about this amazing establishment! 
I have been coming to this Pieology for about 4 years now (thank you college) and I have never been disappointed. 
Like many other reviews have pointed out, the setup is very similar to Chipotle. There is a large variety of toppings to choose from and they are not stingy about it! (I think the only downside to all the toppings they offer is that I always want to pick them all but it makes it difficult to eat the pizza since the crust it is so weighed down......my solution to this, eat the pizza like a taco and grab a fork for anything that falls out). 

I love that they are always adding new things (when I first started coming here I do not think salads were an option) in order to accommodate as many customers as possible. Way to have an option for everyone! 

I absolutely love this place! Great service, great food, great vibes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in at 11:15am right before the lunch rush.  Ordered the Pepperoni, sausage, basil, & jalapeño pizza with herb butter, mozzarella,  & tomato sauce.  Pizza came out perfect, cooked to my liking .  The staff onhand were very nice & accomodating.  BY the time we left, the line was out the door 30 deep.  Get in early or prepare to wait.  Lot's of Fullerton students at this location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">For the first time in 21 years, I've never thought I'd experience something this amazing. This is the first restaurant that I've been to that has 2-ply toilet paper. Every other restaurant I've been to used single-ply which is diabolical and just pure capitalistic. Even Cal State Fullerton (which I pay 3K tuition for each semester provides single-ply toilet paper. You would at least think that a University has the decency to provide 2-ply, but no). Thank you Pieology for providing 2-ply toilet paper for those heavy duty moments. 



Also their pizza is good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food here is amazing!  LOVED my pizza.  And even better, it passed the cold pizza test AND the microwave pizza test.  THAT'S important!!

It's basically Subway for PIzza, and it works.  I saw a couple desert pizza's being made I want to try next time.  

They moved pretty fast for a place where every pizza is made exactly to order.  They bring the pizza to your table so you don't have to wait.  

Here's my only minor (as in minuscule) issue.  It's LOUD!  All concrete floors and lots of college kids (it's near Cal State Fullerton) don't make for easy conversation.  Still won't keep me from returning in the future!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Unlimited toppings. Under $10. What. 
So the concept of this place is just like Chipotle or Subway. You can choose whatever you want from their selection by going down a line.

I chose their pizza of course, but they also have a great salad selection! They serve all their pizzas as a thin crust so its not as heavy as your average pizza. You may think you can't finish one alone, but trust me, you'll want more. I've been here only once before and I forgot how I got it last time, so I think I might have gotten something completely different this time. Doesn't matter. It was delicious both times. 

So here is what I got:

- Sauce: Herb butter and Red Sauce (Tastes GREAT together) 
-Cheese: Mozzarella 
-Toppings (REMEMBER, its UNLIMITED): Red Onions, Cilantro, Roasted Red Peppers, Jalapeños, Spinach, Garlic 
-Meat: Sausage, Pepperoni 

Came out really quickly, but I went on a Sunday and had a early dinner so there wasn't much of a line! You'll definitely leave satisfied!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They do try hard, get really close to getting it right ... Miss the mark a bit  ...  ask for crispy don't want burnt  ...  but that's more what you get ...  a bit burned.  Lots of yummy topping choices, nice staff ... so I'll stop asking for crispy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I tried this place for the first time today....

It was a bit confusing... and I think it was clear we were confused, because someone came out from behind the counter with a menu, and asked us if it was our first time there.  Clearly newbies.

So, its kind of like the Chipotle style Pizza place.  You get in line, and you go through and tell them what you want on your pizza.

We did half and half.... One half with sauce, mozzarella, jalapenos, pepperoni and bacon.  The other half with sauce, mozzarella, cilantro, garlic, pepperoni and meatballs.... That was my half.  How can anyone eat pizza without garlic?

Everyone was very friendly, and the service was really fast.

The only things that I didnt really care for.... The sauce seemed sweet which I dont like... and the noise level!  Woah!  The chairs make SO much noise when anyone moves them... it was definitely deafening.

I do like that you can basically customize your pizza, and they have a lot of options!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I finally tried the famous pieology! :P

I got the butter herb with red sauce, mozzarella, tomato, basil, garlic, mushrooms, sausage and basil.  It was deeelicious!  I liked the crust, too (and not all types of pizza have good crusts!).

I also liked the quotes on the wall!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just OK, had the Spicy Southwest Chicken Pizza, first they ran out of jalapeños then they ran out of the red sour cream sauce. Seems like they need to do a better job stocking up on the food items. I noticed what it seemed to interviews going on during lunch which struck me to be odd..... hello it's lunch time!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The concept of building your own personal pizza is only as good as the end product. At Pieology the staff is friendly, ingredients are fresh and the end product was delicious.

I love the concept of building your own pie for a set price, with no additional or hidden charges on the menu. You start with several options for crust, numerous cheeses and sauces, followed by more toppings than you can imagine - have as many or few as you want. From beginning to end it's fun and very easy. After you build your pie, simply pay and grab a table. You then wait about 3-4 minutes and they deliver the pies to your table.

My son and I both loved our pies and look forward to our next visit.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology never fails me! Everything taste so good and I'm so happy it's near my school and it's affordable for a college student.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Buffalo chicken pizza is SO good! I also like getting "make-your-own" pizzas. They're as fresh as it gets and consistently good. The price is very reasonable for what you get. The service is fast & the people are always nice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wish I could give a better review:  Pizza is great.  HOWEVER, the place is SUPER NOISY!!!  The acoustics are so bad you can't even talk to anyone that isn't directly next to you.  If you have  a party of more than 3-4 DONT GO HERE at lunchtime....unless you never wish to talk :)

A better place to go is The Pizza Press just a few blocks away<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I normally LOVE this place and have become a regular customer.  The other day we went there to datisfy my pepperoni craving. The staff was as wonderful and kind and helpful as always, and two of them even recognized us! But when I got my pizza my mouth started burning up! I checked thoroughly to make sure that I had the correct pizza, and that nobody had added red pepper flakes or something like that, but I couldn't figure it out until... I realized it was the pepperoni!! They have CHANGED the pepperoni!!!!! The new stuff is thicker, not as tasty and EXTREMELY SPICY!!! :( I am so hugely disappointed. I REALLY hope they change it back, because the pepperoni is what I loved at this place. I had done a full comparison test between Blaze, 800 degrees, and Pieology pepperoni, and Pieology had been the clear winner! Now what?! 
PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL PEPPERONI!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time at Pieology. Not a bad experience, given that I'm super late to try it as opposed to everyone else in the OC area. I liked it. It was good food, and it was in a plaza with lots of parking, so that was pretty sweet too.

I went here with my mother after she got back from Korea, so I thought I'd come see what the rave was all about. It's just a Chipotle, you get a piece of dough, some sauce, some cheese, choose your toppings, and they cook it for you on the spot. It's pretty cool I'd say. It's like $8 per pizza, and the things are pretty filling. Thin crust pizza with a very nicely cooked crust and whatever toppings you want on it. They have little instructions posted everywhere, so if you're nervous as to how you should be ordering your pizza, just follow those steps. If you still don't know how to order after all the instructions are plastered everywhere, then you probably need help.

Lots of seating everywhere, although there were a metric ass ton of people there when we ate. Huge dinner rushes probably come and go, but just like Chipotle, there's always a long line of people and a fair number of people who just take it to-go. Definitely a good deal, and a tasty meal for under $10. I'd consider it fast food, but it tastes a lot better than you 'd expect and definitely a go-to.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love love pielogy!!! Never disappoints. I usually create my own toppings. Both white and red sauce are good!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best pizza joint ever ! Amazing pizza & great service. All staff members are friendly. 
Service is fast! Will definitely come here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yum! 

Always delicious, always fast, always hot.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's always packed with people in here! But for many reasons. Pieology is quick, cheap, delicious and fun.  You can customize your own pizza for $8, so if you share with someone it's $4 each which is so amazing to me.

They have a good variety of toppings to choose from, and you can add as many as you like, so the thin crust isn't even a problem because you can add so many toppings to make it a substantial pizza. 

I'm usually still hungry after "halving" a pizza here so I would get the cinnamon sugar pizza afterwards which is sooooo delicious :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">UNLIMITED TOPPINGS?! what else is there to say...? 

Thin crust, I asked for extra red sauce for the base of the pizza, lots of cheese, bring on the bacon please, the toppings go on and on..

Just go. You'll leave happy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I give this place five stars because of the service and the amount of toppings you get for only paying about $8. 
I came here a little bit earlier than when it opened which is 11am  and when the manager (assuming) opened the doors, she was really inviting and had a huge smile on her face. Service is really fast even on a crowded day (been here a few times beforehand already, just never checked in or anything), but it can be difficult to find seats since it does get crowded. Overall, quality of the food is pretty good for a medium sized pizza with unlimited toppings! Have been coming back to this place and will continue to in the future. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">$7.50 to build your own pizza with unlimited toppings? Yes, please! Count me in!

Here are the ingredients that you can mix and match and put on your pizza!

Sauce: 
red sauce, herb butter, olive oil - I recommend herb butter!

Cheeses:
mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, gorgonzola (kind of like bleu-cheese)

Toppings:
pepperoni, sausage, meatball, chicken, ham, bacon, black olives, mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, artichokes, tomato, pineapple, jalapenos, fresh basil, cilantro, garlic

After-bake options:
pesto sauce, BBQ sauce, extra virgin olive oil, fiery buffalo sauce, roasted red peppers, black pepper, and dollops of red sauce - I recommend pesto!!

The idea of creating your own pizza is great, especially for those who enjoy controlling what type and the portions of toppings they want. The workers are nice enough to give you "extra" helpings of a certain ingredient if you ask. Expect long lines, but it is totally worth it. A pizza dinner that you can customize with your own toppings that costs around $10 is not only delicious, but your wallet will thank you for it.

Will come again! =)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love everything about Pieology. They truly know how to treat their customers!  My brother introduced me to this place last year  and I haven't stopped coming. What I love the most is that they'll put more toppings and more if you ask. The wall of inspiring quotes and the smell of the oven roasting the pizza just completes my visit.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">By far best customizable pizza place I've been to thus far. 

Pros:
- ample seating space
- parking is private and available
- manager walks the area to ask how everyone is doing
- the taste of the food is better than other places I've been
- friendly staff

Cons:
- the cinnabread-type dessert was not as good as thought. Unfortunately would even get the Pizza Hut/dominos version over this one
- no menu board at front of line; only when you come in or on side wall so you better know what to order by the time you reach the front of the line counter
-<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pretty damn good. 

I got the bbq chicken pizza and it was fantastic. Sweet and savory, great portion and cooked perfectly. Staff was nice and very helpful. Would recommend coming here.

I've had Blaze Pizza in Orange, and while it is priced the same and the same concept, I prefer this place a little more.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">On December 21st, 2012, the Hawaiian crooner himself, Joe P. (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw), deservedly snagged the ROTD for Pieology with his imaginative slant on an American classic.  Here's a "taste" of his ultra-cool review:

"Don't know much about history
 Don't know much 'Pieology'
 Don't know much about a science book
 Don't know much about the 'Italian' I took"

A year later (December 14th, 2013, to be exact) I also sidled-up to Pieology's 30-person-deep, line-out-the-door queue--singing along, still, to Joe's and Sam Cooke's catchy duet.  Its fingers snapping rythmically, the line sauntered forward, smiling.  It was a "wonderful" Saturday...

Even now, a month or so after having first visited Pieology, I've been literally stumped as to writing a thought-provoking and entertaining review.  I mean, I'm always looking for a creative angle, a clever and artistic avenue; but (in this case) even trying to contribute anything novel or to (rudely) attempt a trump is futile.  On this, Joe's cornered the market.  The rest of us, as a result, must yield.

I, instead, respectfully submit (for Joe's and your approval) a verse:

"Don't know much about cheese-ography
 Don't know much pie symmetry
 Don't know much about ricotta
 Don't know what a 'pizza peel' is for"


;)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am all about Pizza crust, and the crust here is awesome. The ability to make your own pizza is great. They have a ton of options for sauces, toppings, and even the type of crust you want. The pizza comes out crispy and delicious. We waited about 7 minutes for 3 pizzas. My experience was pleasant. I didn't get the usual annoying look when I asked for extra of almost every topping. They didn't even charge me more for the extra toppings! They now serve alcohol!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">EVERYONE LOVES PIZZA!! and it's so much better when you can make your own pizza. PIZZA HEAVEN basically. You can add whatever you want. They have a lot of variety of vegetables, meats, and sauces. 

I am a person that LOVES variety when it comes to eating. So when I am here, I literally stack  my pizza with soo much stuff :P

I use the garlic sauce sauce to spread my pizza first and then half marinara and half pesto. After it comes to the cheese which I'm not a huge fan of so I ask for minimal cheese and then i top my pizza with almost all of the vegetable options and almost all of the meat options.. yeah... Talk about over kill. I mean do whatever you want with your own pizza :) but the ending result is just so good cus it has all the flavors and ingredients I want. :D IT'S SO CHEAP AS WELL. only like $7-$8 for this personal pizza. Pretty filling when you finish it all.

I've tried similar places to pieology and I still believe that this place wins!

MUST TRY!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you're going there for pizza, then it is absolutely great. But if you're going for its salad, know that it has changed its side salad dressing to a mayonnaise  tasting dressing they call creamy Italian. So gross!!!! The original was out of this world. And they stopped making it, so if you were thinking of getting a salad, go elsewhere.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I can't believe I avoided this place for so long. I guess I am so much in my comfort zone that I don't try out new places as much as I should. Not sure why I don't have a problem with trying out dessert places but never mind that. 

So I go to CSUF and I love Panera, so of course I go to Panera next door to here and always wondered about Pieology. I thought it was just another pizza place. Like what is so special about this place? Why the long line all the time? What in the heck are they putting in that dough!? I need to know already! The suspense is killing me!

Okay so I guess it's sort of like a Subway's sandwich where you pick your bread and what goes in it. Here, you pick your sauce, than your cheeses, than your toppings. OR, you can pick one of their specialty pizzas if you can't make a choice. No matter which you pick, it will be GOOD. It's all fresh ingredients! And don't let the line fool you! They can literally make your pizza in 5 minutes! Just order your pizza and drink and have a sat. They will come to your seat and deliver it to you. They also have already made salads (Classic or Caesar)  if you want to grab one of those as well with your meal. By the way, you serve yourself drinks so it's all you can drink. 

Now I would rate this place more like 4.5 stars instead of 5 because they don't have a perfect system yet set up like Panera does. Why not hand out numbers to put at your table like many other restaurants, like Carl's Jr. so that way you know where to deliver the food instead of walking around looking all lost calling out David, or John, what if there's more than one? Or have number on the receipts would be another option. And than we have to go and inspect the pizza if that's the right toppings. By that time, I forgotten what I ordered. Other than that, this place is great!

1. Pick your sauce - Red Sauce, Herb Butter, or Olive Oil.
2. Cheeses - Mozzarella, Ricotta, Parmesan, and Gorgonzola. 
3. Toppings - I won't list them because there's too many.

If you want all four cheeses, go right ahead. 
If you want all the toppings, go right ahead. 

Same price, I believe it's $7.50. 

They do offer gluten-free crust but in their disclaimer they will tell that it may not be 100% free of gluten as there is always a possibility of trace amounts of gluten going in the pizza. Same as bakeries would say about peanuts for those with the allergies. 

I like this location (haven't been to the others) because many times I'm by myself and they have a line of bar stools against the window that you can sit at and people watch. Not that you have a great view or anything but it's better than staring at other strangers eating. 

Tip: If it's the two of you and you're thinking, hmmmm, can we share a pizza? I say it's possible, especially if you want to grab a salad and share that too. They offer half and full sizes but no chicken. 

If it's your first time, I'd share a pizza with someone. You could always get another one if you're still hungry but I doubt it, unless you're a big dude who just got finish working out at the gym, than forget sharing lol. One time I seen three girls sharing one pizza which is doable because they slice it in six little pieces. 

FYI: They are franchising and popping up everywhere! They currently have thirteen locations in California and more will be popping up very soon as we speak. Or type? Or Yelp? Or whatever lol. Just expect this pizza place to be booming everywhere and if I had the money, I'd buy a franchise myself! It's a brilliant idea the way they set it up similar to a Subway!

Happy Eating!!!  :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Another place that I've been wanting to try! Many of you probably already know due to other reviews... but it is what it is.. it's the CHIPOTLE of Pizza's! You wait in line.. when its your turn.. you simply point and tell them what you want on the pizza. Its fun to see them make it and throw it in the huge burning oven in the back. 

Don't be discouraged by the long lines at this location. The line was pretty long when we got there but it moves fairly quickly.. and we didn't have trouble finding a place to seat either. We ended up getting two build your own pizzas and the appetizer herb butter. Its like a crazy bread/garlic bread.. kept very thin! It was YUMMY!

We ordered with our eyes again though..I was so anxious to try the place out.. when we finally got to ordering I wanted to get everything and just throw everything on my pizza...  we ended up having way too much food left over. & ended up taking a whole pizza and half of our appetizer home. I think one pizza is big enough for two people.. but that could just me us. But yes! We will definitely be back for more! They had alot of good specialties that I want to try.. Probable won't build me own next time and just stick to what they have already made. 

** If you are going to build your own though.. I recommend limiting yourself on toppings/sauces.. too much will make you pizza very soggy and flimsy.. **

- it's a thin crust type of pizza so just keep that in mind!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been to this location (the original) of Pieology about a half dozen times and I am not sure why I have never reviewed it. 

 Let me start by saying this location is by far the most well known and is typically always busy if not jam-packed full of customers.  When we arrived the other day the line was all the way back to the back door and blocked much of the seating inside the restaurant (one more person, it would have been out the door).  The line moves relatively fast as the pizzas cook in just a couple of minutes thanks to the use of the extremely hot oven.  Pieology is best described as the Chipotle of pizza joints.  They have numerous pre-designed pizza options from which you can choose as well as a custom option allowing you to select your sauce, cheese, meats and veggie options.  All options are free and included in the $7.50 price so add away (be forewarned however though that the crust is extremely thin so adding more than 7 toppings or so will result in a very flimsy pizza).

For my selection I chose red sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, bacon, red onion and green peppers.  The pizza was cooked and ready in minutes for my enjoyment.  I absolutely love the pizza here and this day was no exception as I devoured the entire thing in less than 5 minutes.  Pieology also offers a couple of different salad options as well as an oil and cinnamon bread option.  Thanks to the big Hostess fallout earlier this year Ding Dongs are no longer on the menu which is disappointing especially as they are still prominently displayed on the pictures throughout.  

The service here is always friendly and are very generous on the topping in my opinion.  Even on the pre-designed pizza options they always ask if there are other ingredients you may want added and are happy to oblige.  At $7.50 for a personal pizza (about 6 slices) it is a great bargain and quite filling.  Anyone who loves having the ability to customize their food will fall in love with this place.  If you are a fan of thick crust pizza then this may not be the place for you but I personally love the thin crust they provide.  The options here are truly endless and despite heavy competition as of late (Blaze's Fast Fired Pizza, Pizza Studio, Pizza Press etc...) the place continues to grow in popularity which is nice to see as they are still my favorite of the bunch.  A definite 5 star place in my opinion if there ever were one, give them a try.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">$7.50 to customize your own pizza with UNLIMITED toppings!
That's right, if you want all the meats they offer (chicken, bacon, sausage, ham, BBQ chicken, pepperoni) then DAMN RIGHT.. you can get them all!
It's set up like Chipotle, point to anything you want and they'll add it to your pie.
They also nicely label everything if you're not quite sure what ingredients are what.
They have all kinds of cheeses and everything topping you can dream of.
Once all toppings are added and you've paid at the cashier, it takes less than 5 minutes for your pizza to bake!
There's also famous quotes painted on the wall that make for an interesting read while eating.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We use to love this place.  Good food and great atmosphere. We literally went at least once a week as a family treat, and use to recommend to many friends. But they keep raising their prices it is a huge bummer. They drew a crowd and now they have officially turned us away. We use to pay around $6 now it is up to $8.45 in a very short time.  Sad to take ours and friends money elsewhere!.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love coming here!! Been eating here since the beginning and the quality hasn't changed, and if it has only for the better. The pizza always comes out bomb but I suggest not getting too many toppings or else it's too heavy for the bread.
The service is awesome as well! The GM came by our table a couple times and she was so happy and enthusiastic. 
Eat here you won't regret it!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place destroys Pizza Studio and Blazin. They cook the pizzas in an actual wood burning stove so the pizza comes out so much better. They can also cool it longer and make it crispy unlike the conveyer belt in the other pizza shops. Plus the selection of toppings is incredible. Love their pizza and customer service. Very friendly staff and employees. Love their pizza. No complaints!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Personalized pizza can't really go wrong with that. The only complaint I had really was they ran out of  parmesan shaker but can't really complain since I came in 20 min before closing time so I had to settle with the packet parmesan.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here for the first time today cause all of a sudden I was craving pizza. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of pizza but I've been yelping this page and it looked so bomb I just had to go try it! I'm so happy I tried this place out that I even want more now!! The crust was amazing and everything else was perfection! Maybe I kinda overdid it with the cheese cause I love cheese but it was still really good. The workers were all very nice, and the food didn't take very long to come out. It was a perfect experience and I'd be sure to come back soon<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always check underneath your pie when you take it to go!! I made the mistake of quickly glancing over mine and failed to notice it was burned..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The pizza version of Subway. Definitely in love with the customizing of pizzas. If you're a deep-dish lover, THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR YOU. I love the thin crust pizzas so they won me over just that quick!

Be wary though, my pizza was rather soggy when I tried to put everything but the kitchen sink on my pizza. So be forewarned, if you stuff your crust like crazy, it may be difficult to crisp up your pizza, or keep it that way if it does get that crunchy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Lined moved fairly quickly, and pizza nice and crispy.  Good food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'll give it 5 stars for it being a great place if you are looking for a fun atmosphere and something in contrast to cheeseboard"s "only 1 kind of pizza per day" pizza but as far as quality and taste goes I give it one star.  This is the kind of pizza you and your friends make during your high school years when your tastebuds have yet to mature. This is the kind of pizza you get when all the other good places are closed and the pizza addict inside of you wants nothing but pizza.
When you see the high number of positive reviews, first think about the 3 most important things; location location location. Thousands of starving college students all within walking distance of this establishment !
Ok, so I'm a pizza snob, but after eating NY pizza for 30+years, i have some strong opinions about pizza, bagels and mass transit :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just want to comment on how awesome the team is in whole at this location. Everyone was working hard but they were just all super happy and smiling and I was in a good mood BECAUSE of them. Even though they were busy they made me feel taken care of. I saw the manager passing me and I commented to her and thanked her for her great team. Every order she would take to a table was with a smile! So happy coming here I'll definitely be back!! Thanks Fullerton pieology!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was expecting something crappy because many people described this place as the "subway/chipotle" of pizzas.  While the concept is the same, I was pretty blown away when I actually ate the pizza here.  The pizza was actually really good.  Then why the 5 stars if it was only "really good"?  Because the pizza's here only cost $7.50, even if you decide to get every single topping on the menu.  The good deal alarm that I carry with me was flashing non-stop.  

If you want to replicate what I ordered, here it is:
#2 - (Pepperoni-Sausage pizza) add parmesan, extra red sauce, garlic, and basil.

Final Verdict - The pizza was cheap ($7.50), flavorful, and had good amounts of ingredients.  Crust was thin crust, crispy, and didn't go soggy.  5 stars!

=============================================

If you're looking for a comparison, a nearby competitor is The Pizza Press.  Pieology wins hands down in terms of flavor/price.  The only good part of The Pizza Press is that it serves local draft beers.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really good and really fast. I was really hungry and my friend took us here. Was expecting a wait and was kinda not feeling it but it was actually really quick from picking out my pizza to getting a box to go. The pizza was really good too. My only gripe is that I thought it was pay per topping and my friend paid so I didn't go all out like I wanted but sometimes less is more right?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been itching to come here after the first time about 2 years ago, but it wasn't as good as I remembered. 

There was nothing memorable about my meal and the plaza here is packed. The line is ridiculously long (20 people ahead of us during my last visit), and I dont' like how they didn't ask us what we would like on our pizza '' afterbake'' since you pay right after you choose your last ''underbake'' (whatever you call it).. we ended up having to get our sauces on the side. 

Not bad, assembly line strategy and flavors both remind me of chipotle, but nothin to rave about either.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A good place to go and get some pizza the way you want it and not pay that much. It's a nice space to. Just like all the new places around .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow! Had the pizza here for the first time last night and it was soooooo good! Highly recommend to anyone who's crazy about pizza like I am haha. The service and employees are exceptionally wonderful to say and are very friendly. Very fast as far as having your pizza made for you. I like the fact that you can see right there up front real good how your pizza is being constructed and it's like your actually making your pizza as if you were at home. Managed very well here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like this pizza. For one, I like that they have wheat. And second, I like that they have a choice of what is going in there. And I like that it is THIN.......I do wish they had a nutritional chart. And if there was anything I don't like is the line. But it comes with the territory.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very Nice, Pieology - you did not Disappoint!

Thanks to all the fabulous reviews on Yelp for this place, I actually PLANNED coming here. Geek-Yelper Alert, I know... but I was not let down at all!

$8.00 for your own personal pizza pie was a win already - and they had some very cool toppings, not just your typical Ninja Turtle style Pepperoni. We're talking gourmet sawce, fresh basil, feta, top of the line veggies and BACON, BACON BACON.... Your pizza is done in about 5 minutes!

Heads Up, Vegetarians, this could be your holy grail - they had Salads in different sizes that you could choose from as well - AND - ya get to add additional toppings if you want. 

For those looking for a quiet restaurant to eat out, do NOT put this place on top of your list. Maybe it was the cathedral ceilings, but the noise was bouncing off the walls here. I came on a Sunday afternoon around 2:00pm and there were a ton of families with kids, not to mention, you have Fullerton College literally down the street so I'll let your imagination kinda put together the noise level of the 2 groups combined.

Another thing would be expect to park a ways away. The parking lot can be tricky and full, so might as well suck it up and park farther than conveniently right next to the restaurant. Not a big deal, besides - you'll have to walk off all that pizza if you finish it all, right?

I'f youre a dainty eater like myself, go ahead and tell the waiter that you want the pizza to-go, so you can control how much you eat and just take the rest home in your awesome personal pizza box.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would give this place 5 stars, but I had an unfortunate experience. I am a vegan and had been ordering their pizza on several occasions. It was not until recently that I discovered that the crust I had been ordering had whey and honey. No one had informed me of this when I had asked. The pizza is always delicious and cooked to perfection when I come. I just wish their employees were more knowledgeable about the products that they are serving. It is very disappointing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't even know where to BEGIN with this place! The Pieology on State College Blvd is always a favorite of my family! We have been coming here for the past year since we have moved to Anaheim and keep coming back because this place is awesome! The pizza and salad are so flavorful and at an amazing price! Once you eat pizza here, no other pizza kitchens compare! Not only is the food great but the cleanliness of the store and the workers here is the main reason we keep coming back! The staff is so polite but by far Clarissa is my family's favorite person there! She is so friendly and professional and always takes amazing care of not only my family but everyone else enjoying their meals as well! Thank you Clarissa and Pieology, see you very soon!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is such a fantastic business idea!!

They have gluten free or wheat crusts.  They are pretty thin but I like that. 

What I got:
Gluten- free crust (+2.00)
White sauce,
Feta 
Mozz
Sun dried tomatoes
Jalapeños 
Artichoke hearts 
Black Olives
Kalmata olives 
Spinach 
Spicy chicken 

All for 10.00. What a deal!!  

They have many different topping options. My pizza was fantastic and didn't make me feel too guilty for eating it.

Such a great cheat meal!!

Staff is very friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I didn't used to be a HUGE fan of pizza...because before the cool food movement came along, pizza was doughy or greasy...reminiscent of late night post-alcohol binge fests.  

Then Pieology came along and made thin-crust, personal pizzas available to everyone.  You didn't have to travel to Italy or shell out more money than usual a la Pizzeria Mozza.  Thin crust!  Thinner than those slices of NY style pizza everyone folds in half.  This was different...this was excitingly edible!

When we arrived, the line was pretty long but thanks to the fast workers, we were moved right along (attitudes were kind of brusque when they rushed us through our choices).  One guy who was on clean-up duty was super nice and friendly.

Pizzas came out pretty fast (presumably due to the thin crusts) and were  yummy.  The crusts were a little too greasy (from olive oil) so sister-in-law did spend some time mopping up excess oil. For whatever reason, the guy who prepped the crusts at the beginning of the assembly automatically brushed a bunch of oil on and wouldn't give her a new oiless one.  How odd.

There is much more seating here than the one at Irvine Spectrum though if you have a big group, you may have to scramble or split up.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology has changed the world of pizza making.

Getting to make your own pizza and add as many toppings as you'd like for $7.95? ARE YOU KIDDING?

What I order:
Garlic butter and half red sauce on the dough.

Cheese:
Mozzarella
Gorgonzola
Blue Cheese
Ricotta

Veggies:
Cilantro
Jalapeños
Tomatoes
Garlic
Corn

Meats:
Ham
Bacon
Spicy chicken

All over the top I add pesto sauce after they make it. So freakin' delicious and the service is superb. Always checking up on tables and making sure all their customers are satisfied! I come out happy and full every time I eat here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm updating my review bc of an employee name Theodore. He went above and beyond with great customer service once he realized I was vegan. He made sure I was aware of what was dairy free and what wasn't. It was extremely helpful and I truly appreciated it. He made up for my previous encounters here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was visiting the area and ate there twice, they do eletric oven but pizza was delicious and very cheap. Place was clean, staff very friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here for the first time with the family. I'm so glad we did! This is the best place to get pizza! I'm never going anywhere else for pizza. 

We got there 10 minutes before they opened and there was already people waiting to get in. The wait was not too bad though. 

We ordered the #2 and added bacon and ham, #7 and added mushrooms, herb butter strips, and cinnamon sugar strips. Everything was delicious! The herb butter strips and cinnamon sugar strips were a hit for my girls. 

I would recommend this place and I'll definitely come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Pieology pizza!
You can customize your own food! Yay~!
Great place! It's located inside the small plaza next to Japanese restaurant.
Plenty parking space behind the building.

Very friendly staff!

Highly recommended and definitely will be back soon!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We love designing our own pizza!  The price is right too.  This place is our one of our family favorites!  Unlimited toppings on the type of crust that you want... White, wheat, or gluten free.  The service is always great.  The employees always go above and beyond to give us a great experience.  The line always moves quickly and the pizza is always great!  Special thanks to Clarissa for always being so sweet to our 5 year old son.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">1st time eating at any Pieology location. They workers we patient as our group of 6 decided what to order. I mentioned that it was my first time having Pieology and workers explained it to me. Which is very easy by the way... pick a butter flavor if you want, sauce, cheese(s)more than one cheese, meats & veggies. ALL UNLIMITED!! The crust is thin...almost like a flat bread. the price was reasonable about $8 with tax. 

I just Yelped another location closer to me and hope to get the same experience here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">"Eek! Methinks not."

They've raised their prices and have franchises in other states?! I remember the last time I patronized this establishment it was just $7.50+7.75%=$8.07 and they were still only in Fullerton. Then this most recent time I was here, the prices have gone up to $8+8%=$8.64 for a tiny and thin "pizza" and certain ingredients are different as well!

Them fucking rich white folks always gotta have mo' money so they sell franchises and raises their prices instead of keeping it local. It's now the McDonald's of pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After experiencing Grade 'A' customer service during my first two visits, I sadly have to report that my third visit on Oct. 26 was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a pizzeria. 
After having to wait at the counter for over 5 mins to be acknowledged, my daughter and I soon discovered for the first time that their regular crust is not suitable for vegans, thus upsetting my daughter. Further adding to their incompetence,  we also discovered at the register that I was having to pay an additional $4. for the vegan crust and vegan cheese.
And as soon as I asked if they'd honor the military discount, they only deducted 5% as opposed to the 50% discount offered a week prior without making the announcement before paying for the meal.
On top of all that trouble that took nearly 20 mins to accomplish at the counter, our pizzas were burned on the bottom (crusts), which almost caused me to break a tooth, not expecting it to be so hard on my first bite. 
I was upset enough to complain to a manager, yet did not want my daughter to deal with more heartache. And noticed all but one of the managers were sitting at a table having a pow-wow.
Oh, the fountain drink tasted like wax. 
Just the fact the employees/staff would not acknowledge their negligence and lack of concern, was enough for me to believe the company's standards have severely dropped to an all-time low rather quickly.
[Keep in mind, the store only had a few customers in the house at the time.]
Because of their decline to level of 'fast food' mentality, and LACK of priority #1-customer service, I won't be paying their stores a visit anytime soon. In fact, I'll be sure to tell all my friends and family to steer clear until they've raised the standards.
Buyer Beware<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is great & the staff, friendly & very helpful. 

The only minor complaint I have is that the chairs are not balanced & noisy when you pull them. But if you can tolerate the noise of friends & families having good pizza, this shouldn't bother you that much<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome!

/review

Well I don't know what else needs to be said about this place other than it is awesome. I love when I go here. I keep coming back and telling others about it too... This is the second location that I have been to and I like it as much if not better than the Irvine Spectrum location.

Basics... walk up to the counter and make the following decisions:

Crust - regular or gluten free

Sauce - oil, herb butter, marinara

Cheese - mozzarella , parmesian, blue, goat, and something else I cant recall off hand

Meat - BACON!!!!, sausage, beef, pepperoni, ham, chicken

Veggies - garlic, pineapple, peppers, olives, mushrooms, tomatoes, and I have no idea what else... I don't put veggies on pizza anyways so ummm yeah *shrugs*

Then they bake it and bring it to you by shouting out your name as they wander around the room =D

Pro Tip: 10+ inch personal pizza with any combo of toppings you want on a thin crust pie for $7.50 +tax ($8.10 with tax for this location, I posted a pic of the receipt) 

Awesome taste. Quick table busing. Awesome deal. I cant wait for lunch so I can eat the other half of the pie I ordered and ate half of yesterday.

OMNOMNOMNOMNOM - yeah I just went there hahaha

None the less the grub here for the price is spectacular.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've always been a big fan of Pieology.  Glad there is a location close to my new office.  Same exact concept that I remember from Irvine Spectrum, except I don't get to read the quotes until after I order my pizza.

I still trip out how this place lets me pile on the ingredients.  For the price this is good.  Dare I say healthy considering the super thin crust.

This is definitely going to be one of my go to lunch places in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Two stars knocked out for the lack of cleanliness and an instance where I asked for an ingredient three times and I got a sprinkle of the said vegetable. 

Pizza is great but clean up the damn place! Also the condiments were empty and had to ask from the manager.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best customizable pizza at it's price point period.
Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and you can't deny the success of pieology when other pizza places copy it's formula.
Pieology tastes better then the competition, and has a better variety of toppings to choose from.
The pizza makers also take additional requests such as adding more sauce, toppings, and even splitting pizza in half so that you can have two types of pizza for the price of one.  The cinnamon strips at $2.95 are like sugary crack sprinkled on dough.  You just can't get enough of them.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Well I finally made it out here. 

The pizza is...good. I would be willing to try for again. You can make your own pizza and choose from a variety of cheeses and meats, or choose a pre built one. 

The crust is good, and one thing I really like is how the pizza doesn't fill you up. If you're in Fullerton, be sure you stop by.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So it's been over a year since I jumped onto the Pieology hype bandwagon and decided recently to stop by. Geez, I can't even imagine how I used to think this place was any good.

The customer service STILL sucks, so at least they can keep something consistent around here. Like I said in my review before, I'm not asking everyone to be cheerful because I could honestly care less. The only thing that irks me is when people dread the fact that they're at work and hate their job and take it out on you.

Anyway, the pizza was runny and very bland compared to how it tasted when they first opened. I hate eating a boring and unsatisfying meal and Pieology was just that that day.

It's still cheap, so if you're on a budget then I guess you could come here. I'd just spend my money elsewhere IMO.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good location and great friendly service. My kids love their personalized pizzas and the Dole whip soft serve. I love the crispy crust pizza and my IPA on tap. Add the friendly service on multiple visits and this place gets 5 stars from me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle for pizza!

You tell them what you want, they top it, and cook it.  It's the same $7.50 regardless of what you put on it.

The sauces are yummy and the pizzas are yummy.  I got the pesto.  

I wish the customer service was better, though.  It was my first time, and they did not explain anything to me.  I ordered one of their menu items, and then got confused when they were asking if I wanted just about every item on my pizza.  

Also, the line was pretty long because I went during lunch time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place! Always has a long line but don't let that scare you, it always goes very fast. Staff is friendly, food is cheap and delicious!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here more than a couple times and loved the pizzas I got! However, my recent visit was pretty bad. The place was packed with people and the line went around the entrance. I feel like when it's busy, the employees feel rushed and more focused on getting things done than making things good. 

All the toppings I wanted on my pizza were literally thrown on there. Not spread apart evenly and definitely not enough! Just because there will be several toppings on the pizza doesn't mean you should put half a handful of each and throw it in one area. I was really disappointed. I asked for a lot of mushrooms and had to ask again to put more because the guy barely put any the first time. I got it to-go and once I got home, the chicken was barely cooked! It was squishy and looked RAW. I had to take each one out because almost 90% of the chicken was like that. I was disgusted, sadly, and barely wanted to keep eating it. Definitely a waste of $8. I actually enjoyed this place before, but I don't think I will come back.

I definitely do not recommend getting the chicken and coming at a busy time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best pizza place ever! I grew up believing I wasn't a pizza lover. Now that I know of a place where I can put pesto sauce instead of tomato, veggies such as artichokes and spinach, an assortment of cheeses, and a wild imagination of toppings on top of the dough, I can't wait to have pizza. No more boring pizza for me. My only wish is that there were a few more cheese options available, but I am still very happy with what they have. Have fun when you decide to try it out -- experiment and you won't be disappointed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love love love love this place!! It's fun, fresh and cheap! 

If you don't like the way your pizza comes out, that's on you!!! Because you basically make it yourself. No one else to blame and if the pizza comes out fantastic, then good for you for picking a winning combination. 

The best way to describe Pieology is "make your own pizza" kinda like subway or chipotle. All the toppings to pick from, all kinds of meats, sauce, veggies it's very impressive. You pick it, they put it on your pizza and it goes into the oven! 

Little reminders: 
* Less is more. Sometimes piling up the pizza with tons of toppings makes it soggy and not so great. 
* Get the dessert pizza to split with friends!! It's yummy. 

This place was absolutely perfect for me and my man, because I like mushrooms, he's allergic, I like onions and bell peppers, he doesn't. So he gets his own pizza and I get mine and everyone is happy. A pizza for $7 and your stuffed! It's a good deal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I found the place fun and pretty good. The pizza is delicious if not a bit thin. I like the freedom, though I definitely recommend looking at what's there before ordering. Also, the only thing really not great about this location is that the parking is tight and people drive like jerks, forcing you to maneuver in weird positions and block traffic at awkward spots. Get there a lil early and it's a nice place to be.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the concept, everything is Fresh, and they have gluten free &a vegetarian options.  Everyone gets their favorites!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's a great concept; step up and create your own pizza with plenty of topping options. However, the first thing you need is flavorful sauce. The flavor just isn't there.  We ordered a full veggie pizza and added pepperoni and sausage.  It was bland. 

I also ordered a salad side which was fine, but it strikes me as odd that a place that makes pizzas to order would serve prepackaged side salads.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome place...   There is always a line but the line moves really fast. We are regulars here because the service is always excellent and the pizza taste good.   They get so many orders and I don't know how but I've never gotten my order messed up.   You get whatever you want on the pizza and they never complain or give you an attitude.    Would definitely recommend....    Thank you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">DELICIOUS ! MUST TRY ! 

It was my first time at Pieology and it did not disappoint. It was truly an experience. The pizza is very flavorful. I recommend chicken bbq or chicken alfredo or both! The employee who made my pizza was very genuine and sincere in their suggestions for my half and half pizza. Also I signed up for their emails where they will send coupons or heads up on promos. And tbh Pieology is quite a drive from where i live but it is so good that i would not mind driving there when i get a craving for pizza which is quite often lol also it was 9.13$ total for one create your own (half and half). Can't wait to go back!!! 

PS I would love it even more if they added options to create a mac n cheese pizza...*hint hint*<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place. None like no other. Other Pieologies burn my pizza. Not good. The corona location off of the 15 fwy south and Ontario ave. The management here at the Fullerton location are amazing the staff is awesome blossom. It's always clean. Well picked up. Go 2-3 times a week. Always fresh. They work as a team. Always welcoming everyone who is there eating and who comes through the door. Hoping you guys truly don't loose your magic. Really great for families. Great place to hang out. Thank you Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Here you go, If you don't like the food you have only yourself to blame, kind of the Subway of Pizza, you pick all your stuff and they cook your pizza for you, and fast too. The only beef I have with this place is when its crowded its LOUD in there , the corporate architects of this place should take that into consideration when building these places and get with a sound engineer to make the place quieter by using sound deadening panels and non opposing surfaces, its like a gymnasium. Well I guess it makes some of us leave sooner to make room for more customers,, well played Loudology.....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is just like chipotle, but actually much more efficient and even the quality of food is better too. But comparing the two is like "apples & oranges". 

The pizza is thin and thus, low carb, so that's great! For the price you pay, and the amount of topping you can add, its a great deal here for lunch and dinner.

I would like to come here again, and I am hoping they'll open up more locations through out the OC!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My family and I decided to have pieology and we all got sick. My younger son vomited  twice and it all came out. My older son and myself were not able to sleep due to upset stomach and we both had diarrhea all night long. I'm convinced that it has something to do with the dough not being properly cooked. This took place on a Saturday night right before they closed.  Employees looked like they were ready to leave because they removed several of the topping trays and it was a quarter till nine. Again not sure what happened but will not  visit establishment for a long time. Update, it's now Tuesday and We all still have diarrhea and had to call out sick. We need to be next to bathroom.  Going to dr.'s today !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went to Pieology for the second time today and holy crap was I impressed.  However, my first time I thought it was so-so probably because I ordered one of the pizzas on their menu rather than putting one together myself. Clearly, the trick is to be creative here.

I ordered half red sauce/half herb butter and pesto with mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan cheese with chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic, olives, and artichokes.  

It was beautiful. (I will say the herb-butter/pesto mix was better than the red sauce though, but that's more personal preference than anything.)

The line moves unreal fast and the employees are really friendly and didn't mind as I spent a disgusting amount of time deciding what sauces I wanted. For $7.50 I dare you to find a better deal for a pizza this size, with this many fresh toppings-----impossible.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology is very similar to blaze with their unlimited toppings and fast fired pizzas.  This is another excellent pizzeria and it is conveniently close to school.

Food:  SO GOOD!!  Excellent crust, amazing variety of cheeses (mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Parmesan, ricata, vegan, and others).  They also have a huge variety of veggies and fruits (artichoke hearts, olives, kalamata olives, broccoli, spinage, tomatoes, onion, pineapple, roasted bell pepper, bell pepper, corn, cilantro, oregano, carrots, and more!).  They also have all the meats but I wouldn't know too much about that one because I'm not into meat.  This beautiful masterpiece of a pizza is then cooked to perfection in enough time to get back to work before my break ends.

Cost:  Less than $9 for unlimited toppings!!

Customer service:  Awesome they are always so sweet and accommodating even when they stare at me like "you really want more toppings?"  YES UNLIMITED IS FREE!

Building:  nice I love the quotes on the walls and the decor is very modern.  The kitchen can look quite a mess sometimes (took off a star for grimy floors in the kitchen not in the dinning room).

Overall I will be returning to Pieology for more pizza!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My first time at Pieology was so cool! Unlimited topping and the service was amazing! The workers are willing to go the extra mile to help me cap my drink! I was speechless LOL. Very Gentle-Man like when they even opened the door for me. ^-^<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is another place that has been on my bookmark list for months and months, and I was so excited to finally come over here----with all of the hype and awesome reviews........

And I was very underwhelmed =(    I thought the setup is cool--you can pick out every single item for your pizza and they will make it for you, similar to a chipotle setup. If you have special diet needs then this is the place for you!  

Here is the problem; to me the pizza wasn't very good. The sauce was tasted very watery, cheese was just ok. They were stingy with the toppings and with the pizza being so thin I was still hungry after eating a pizza. The pizza I requested didn't even look good, maybe it was just a bad day.  If you are looking for a health conscious pizza then I guess this is your place, you can get it gluten free, with artichokes (yuck) and other hippie toppings.  Also, if you are a college student on a budget, I can see how this place is golden after eating top ramen all week. I think this is who this place is for, college students who are just hungry lol.

But if you are looking for a pizza tasting pizza then I would recommend going to a traditional pizza place to avoid the disappointment. There are too many other rocking pizza places nearby to come back here.....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been wanting to try this place because I normally go to Pizza Studio wanted to see who was better... The biggest difference is the crust for sure.. Because Pielogy uses a brick oven versus Pizza Studio uses a conveyer belt style oven the crust at Pielogy is nice and crispy and taste better then Pizza Studio. The reason for the 1 star reduction is because they were a little stingy on the toppings.. Other then that I will go back if I'm ever in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">6:30pm: This is the time this review was started, the point at which we entered the back of the long line at Pieology in Fullerton, CA. 

This restaurant is Chipotle. I mean everything, the exterior facade, the interior dining area tables and chairs right down to the open ceiling with exposed ventilation ducts. This could easily confuse an extremely hungry person like me who is waiting in line. "Yes I will take one chicken burrito, white rice pinto beans...Oh, this is a pizza place? Ohhhh ok. Cool. Give me all of that I just mentioned on a piece of dough that is not wrapped please. Thanks..."

6:45pm: We r about 1/3 of our way to the front counter...

7:03pm: We have now completed our order and r seated waiting for pies to be delivered to our table...The order process is exactly like Chipotle. I'm still convinced we r at Chipotle and a cameraman will appear any minute to inform us we r on an episode of "hidden camera..."

7:07pm: Ok so the food came out really fast. The trays for the pizza look just like, you guessed it, Chipotle.

So the pizza was ok, I hadn't ordered anything crazy, some ham, bacon, chicken, olive oil, parmesan/mozzarella cheese and red sauce. But I was disappointed that I could not get a good taste of the red sauce. I was hoping for more flavor from the red sauce. Pizza is always about the sauce.

I would recommend trying this place at least once to see what you think. I probably would not return as compared to other pizzas I have tasted, I put this towards the bottom. 

I'm just gonna bring my own pizza to Chipotle and pretend I'm at Pieology,

Thanks,

CJ<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Looking for affordable, good quality pizza? Well you are looking at the right place!

This place is only 10 mins away from me, and if i REALLY want some GOOD pizza, this is it! Mainly if i'm craving thin crust! This is the Chipotlie/Subway of pizza parlors, but with really fresh, good quality ingredients that makes me feel like I'm eating fairly healthy pizza (weird right?) 

For only $7 you can get your own pie with whatever ingredients that they have available! I usually go for garlic herb, maranaria and add some chicken with TONS of veggies like olives and artichokes, YUM! Also a must try is their Garlic Herb "bread sticks" - they basically use their whole pie and slather up their garlic herb on top and cook it as bread sticks, so good!!

Whenever I go it's usually crowded but it isn't too bad finding seats since people come in and out pretty quickly. Love the atmosphere, it's roomy and especially love the quotes on the wall! It's just something nice to look at while chomping down on some delicious pie! So what are you waiting for? GO TRY IT! :D<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The concept of making your own pizza has been around for a long time, but a few things make Pieology stand out. 

I'm normally a thick crust guy, and am usually reluctant towards thinner crusts, but here, you kind of forget about the crust and focus on the toppings. It's almost like you're designing a flatbread. 

You're not going to find all the toppings in the world here, but for $8, you can experiment with different combinations. Try the spicy chicken. It's all the same price anyways.

Lastly, the personal pizzas come out quick. The guy manning the oven probably has the most important job in this establishment. You won't have to wait forever to dig in (that is, after you order).

Classic salad was okay. It's nice to have something else to munch on besides pizza.

Line at Saturday 5:30 PM was about 30 minutes. At 6:00 PM, it looked like it was an hour long.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First assembly guy: What cheese?

Me: Everything. 

First assembly guy: Your pizza is going to be disastrous. 

What the heck did he say? Disastrous? This guy needed to go to SERVICE-OLOGY.  

Ended getting all the cheeses, but the way he commented about my pizza (which tasted devine by the way) was intently rude.

Ok, I did not ask for his recommendation and if he was Chef Bobby Flay telling me, I would understand. But coming from a guy who'd probably eat a ham and cheese sandwich as his last meal, then no. 

I enjoy variety. I'm always experimenting with new combinations and for that day I wanted all the cheeses. Do I have to explain myself? 

I learned my lesson from my first visit not to order every single topping which I didn't. Got all the meats and some light vegetables. 

I'm starting to believe the word, "everything", is blasphemous in there. 

You just don't say it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm sure there are already plenty of reviews of this place here so I'll keep this short.

Pizza made to order, how you want it, what you want in it, for a fairly decent price.  The selections are all pretty good.  Herb butter is a must.  This place is just too busy sometimes.  Expect to wait in line for about 20-30 min during dinner time... when I see a line wrapping around the walls inside, I've had to walk out a couple times because of this.  Fortunately, there are plenty of other options nearby, but if you're craving a pizza, Pieology is not a bad way to go.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle concept meets pizza?  Genius!  I had Pieology bookmarked for a while and was excited to finally try it out.  I think overall, the potential is there to create a really tasty pie.  At $8, the pies are affordable and can easily be shared.  They'll even allow you to split the toppings on your pie (i.e. 1/2 pineapple).  The bf and I came here for a snack and loaded up our pie with probably way too many toppings.  

The pie came out rather quickly and we dug in.  I couldn't really taste anything, but again, that was probably our fault because we loaded our pie with practically all the toppings. 

My main gripe is that the crust is thin-granted this probably ensures a quick turnaround for cooking.  My second gripe is that with so much staff around, they could do a better job in keeping the tables wiped down.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really enjoyed the friendly AND EXTREMELY HELPFUL staff!  The food was good but the atmosphere and the little open area near the window facing State College was really sweet.  It reminded me of an outdoor pizzeria.  Definitely a great touch. 
For the food, it was similar to a Chipotle.  Very fresh ingredients and a good array of options.  I would've given this place 4 stars BUT the staff really did make this a 5 star place.  The manager cleaned up after previous guests in order for us to take a table in the shade away from the window and spoke to us about our day and the location and we were pleasantly surprised by his friendliness.  The pizza was good, mine could've used a little bit more time in the oven because the middle came out a little soggy, but the edges of the pizza were great and crispy and just awesome.  So for the awesome staff and the good pizza, I give this place a 5.  Thanks to all the staff for their kindness and suggestions on the pizza!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not a super big place but good food. When I came with my boy friend and his mom it was somewhat crowded and the line to get food was somewhat long but eventually it all died down. 

What makes this different from your regular old pizza place is the fact that you can create your own pizza for a flat price. Whatever you want and as much as you like without having to pay extra. (Very nice!) my boyfriend being severely allergic to any dairy products can have pizza any way he likes it without worrying about getting sick. 

The pizza is very delicious I admit (of course I design it )  but there was some downfall to this place. My pizza's crust was just a little too crunchy for me. Then the sound inside can get a little too loud. Other than that everything seemed to be great. 

We all had a wonderful time and it was nice see an employee cleaning the tables every time a group left. So you know that you are getting a clean table. 

I will definitely be going back there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the pizza. The people that work here are pretty friendly and on top of stuff. The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars, is that I prefer the dough from blaze.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Chipotle of Pizza.   Design your own pizza.    Fast easy.  It's really a no brainer.   

Famous for: Personalized artisan/custom personal pizzas for $8<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It doesn't take a rocket scientist to make quickie pizzas! 

I like to call Pieology a fun pizza place:

- Stay in line, maybe a long line, but it goes quick!
- Look at the menu, decide what you want, you can customize your pie as well.
- Now your in striking distance in front of pizza artist to full-fill your request like a Subway.
- Then Pay, my order was a Thin Crust with chicken, bell peppers, mozzarella cheese and jalapeños cost me about $7.50 not bad for a good personal size.
- Last but not least within 5 mins. they take your order to your table calling out your name.

My Verdict is that the pizza tasted alright...yeah and I mean Aiiiiiite...!!! Maybe because the pizza was too hot to bite and my tongue was burnt by it to fully grasp the flavor, but I am not going to make that slide a bit. The ingredients were average and the pizza left greasy with the oil being a bit much.

But hey I was able to finish my pie and my stomach left me bloated. I tried to stop eating but my foodie ego says "Man Vs Food finish it!!!"

Like I said its fun pizza...just not authentic.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We LOVE Pielogy.  Always a GREAT experience going into any Pieology.  We didn't know that this place was the 1st/ original location.  We've been to many different locations, and all of them are always good and such a GREAT value.  

From our experience, it seems that this location doesn't "pack" the pie as much with toppings compared to other locations like the one at Irvine Spectrum.  But unlimited toppings and a personalized pizza for under $10, how can you really complain?  Thank you Pieology for the great value and fresh, tasty pizza pies!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is my love. Pizza is my life. Pieology is by far the best pizza joint I've ever been to. I love the concept of being able to customize your own pizza according to your preference. Love that the pizza itself isn't too greasy. Overall an amazing place! Definitely worth a try if you've never been here. 

P.S. Get the pesto sauce. It's good on anything IMO<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Frikin amazeballs!!!! Holy frikin moly!!!!! Love the choose ur sauce n any amount of toppings   Love pesto w onions n bell peppers. Don't like change of pepperoni.  A little spicier than before.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everything was good! You bet your sweet bottom caboose I'll be back! They'll deserve SIX STARS when they start serving libations/vivations (you know whaaa I'm sayin)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Pieology is not a union run shop like the Pieology location in Carson. No. This Pieology is a well oiled machine that runs at max output.

Line? No problem. It'll move fast, trust me.

Happy employees? No problem. They will cheer up your day even if you are down.

Fast service? No problem. They are speedy little robots here!

Clean tables? No problem. The robots are always on patrol to clear off tables and keep them nice and tidy.

Proximity to CSUF? No problem. A little more crowded but also perhaps why they are used to being so efficient.

Of course the pizza is consistently well prepared, not a lot to screw up with their quick assembly line!

Good stuff!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It seems this place is ALWAYS packed, luckily the line went by fast and was able to find a table for 3 by the time the pie's came out!

I ordered half #3 and #6 - but it somehow got lot in translation in the very short, 3 man assembly line.. -_- I ended up basically with a #3 (BBQ Chicken), with 2 different types of cheeses. I had the sense to add some jalapenos and bacon to my concoction and it was still glorioussssss

The crust is so good, flat, and crispy. Perfectly seasoned. The ingredients were fresh. BBQ sauce they drizzled was bomb. Jalapenos were the kicker. The bacon was aite (sadly).

The "after bake" stuff seemed completely out of the question at the end.. I think partially because they're just so busy... I know someone wanted to add pesto on their pizza but didn't get the chance to.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you see something at Portland 5 (e.g., Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall), the program has a coupon that's 2 for the price of 1. Get it however and go to town with as many toppings as possible.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely best pizzas! What i love the most about this place is that you can custom design your own pizza with whatever ingredients you like! The taste and flavor is not boring because you get a chance to modify it every time. 5 different cheeses, lots of vegetables, meats and dried fruits. Served under 10 mins and the stuff is very friendly! We usually split one with my husband, where he gets the ingredients he wants on his side and i on my side. Great meal for two for under $9!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is the Chipotle of pizza and it is bombbbbb. 

I can't tell you what to get since to each their own..if you like chicken then get chicken..but I will say adding herb butter to the edges and marinara in the middle, gives you a herby, buttery crust that is delicious!! -1 star for not having anchovies..sorry not sorry, but they're my fav :/<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology was so goooood! It's an 8 sliced pizza for $8.95 including tax with UNLIMITED toppings! My pizza was a thin crusted mountain of sauce, cheese, veggies, meats, herbs, and more. I split the pizza with a friend and we still had leftovers for the both of us. But, the pizza was so good that I probably could have finished the pizza on my own if I hadn't practiced some self-control. I would compare Pieology to chipotle because you work your way down the line adding all of the condiments and toppings you want. You then pay and wait for your pizza to come out of the brick oven. I highly recommend Pieology and definitely wish there was one closer to where I lived. It's a great place for pizza lovers and for those who enjoy making their own pizza too! Pieology fits any pizza craving in the moment whether it's original or creative/unique.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ate here a total of 3 times. I dont know why everyone said the pizza is only good if you customize it correctly.  I think i want my pizza to taste good no matter what i put on it.  I even had their suggested toppings and still not impress.  Pizza is floppy and bland.  I think its the sauce.  I made my own pizza at home with cheap frozen crust that tasted a lot better.  

Don't get me wrong.  I love the concept but its not for me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">BUILD YOUR OWN PIZZA & i guess pizza's only as good as you can make it (unless you order off their menu)! BUT judging on their crust, its crispy, oily, & thin, just not as thin as my fav pizza places in NYC

$7.50 for any menu pizza OR your own custom (just tell them what you want, chipotle assembly-line style) 
---#4 w/ added tomatoes: yummy, liked how it wasn't too heavy since it was light on the cheese
---my CUSTOM pizza: (pesto sauce, mozzarella, garlic, mushroom, & basil): WAY too much mozzarella, i guess i just trusted the workers would know how much was enough! ALSO wish they had fresh buffalo mozzarella

i'd probably stick to the menu pizzas & just change a topping here or there because they might have a better idea of the ingredient proportions!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hey Beautiful People!

So you know how very often, the "original" is always the best? Pieology is no exception to the rule!

Owned by Michael Chang (yes, THAT Michael Chang) and his older brother, Pieology exploded onto the OC foodie scene very much like how Michael exploded onto the tennis scene a few decades ago.

Since then, there have been so many imitators, including Blaze and Pitfire; yet, Pieology has managed to stay on top because it offers customers everything they want...with a smile! :o

I've never experienced burnt or soggy crust at Pieology, nor have I ever been served by anyone who looked unhappy to give me more toppings. (Yes, this has happened at other places!)

I also appreciate that they handle their crowds well, and in 5-10 min, the people at the end of the line out the door are now in the front.

So what toppings do I recommend for your Pieology experience?

1.) Herb Butter - Get your crust buttered with this!

2.) Pesto - You can get red sauce anywhere else--be a little adventurous! ;)

3.) Mozzarella, Ricotta, AND Parmesan - Cheese lovers UNITE!

4.) More Chicken. More Bacon. - Don't be shy!

5.) Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, Ham - You get the point. ;)

6.) Garlic and Fresh Basil - Garlic because it's delicious; Basil to counteract your beastly breath after you're done eating.

When you get your pizza, it might just look this divine:

(Or, it could look like a hot mess, but either way, it will still be delicious! ;))

Thanks for reading!

P.S. If you want a slightly healthier, less excessive pizza, you could make this:

(But that would probably defeat the purpose of coming here. :p)

P.P.S. Was this Useful, Funny, and/or Cool? Let me know below!  ^_^<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Eh... I suck at customizing pizzas. This is what I learned after tasting my poorly created pizza. I just added all these random meat toppings without balancing it out with enough non-meat toppings. Fortunately, my friend was better at this whole pizza creation thing and I got to see what a good custom pizza should taste like. I'm convinced that it needs pineapples for one!

I felt like there was a bit more grease than there should've been and perhaps that could've been because of my meat toppings. Also, my bottom was a little too burnt; my fingers were covered in black of the charred crust...

Being the good yelper that I am, I remembered to ask for side of their pesto sauce that I read about which made the pizza eating experience much better. A few drops on each slice of pizza did the magic and really improved it.

In the end, I think 3 stars is a good average of my poor pizza and my friend's good pizza. I guess this place is only as good as your pizza customizing skills...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Location: near Troy High School and Cal State Fullerton

Parking: Too many 30 minute parking slots in the vicinity!

Price: 1 personal pizza = $8.10 (includes tax)

Pizza: Red + Herb Butter Sauce topped with Mozzarella + Ricotta Cheese, Bacon, Ham, Sausage, Pepperoni, Olives, Mushrooms, Artichokes, Tomato, Pineapple, Basil, and Garlic 

*See pic here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton?select=SgbSHLKXUI3dOk9MebKEDw#SgbSHLKXUI3dOk9MebKEDw


Service: Could be improved--my gripe is that the employees don't always listen to the customer's preferences (my friend actually just wanted ricotta cheese but she wasn't able to tell one making her pizza because he had already doused the pizza pie with mozzarella).

Wait time: at least 15 minutes to get through the line

Bottom line: Go here for your pizza fix if you can stand waiting in line.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! Think, chipotle for pizza.

PARKING: Kinda sucks, a lot of the spaces are marked 30 minutes or 60 minutes so you have to watch out and the line at Pieology can get kind of long so plan accordingly.  Otherwise, I just park near the supermarket area and walk over.

WAIT: The wait is usually long, especially during lunch hour.  I've gone at 12pm on a Friday and 2pm on a Sunday and it's STILL a long line. I think it's because it takes people a while to order and get through the line.

ATMOSPHERE: Looks like chipotle, feels like chipotle.  With the metal chairs and wooden type booths and tables in the center and the line that you can order at.  It's casual but fun, something unique.

FOOD: I always choose my own toppings/make my own pizza. If you're one of those people that like to get the most out of your money you should do this because it's the SAME price for the pre-chosen pizzas (where they already list out the toppings) but for lazy people or those that don't like too many choices, the pre-chosen pizzas are good too (my boyfriend said the BBQ chicken was really good).

Anyway, I get half and half, because why not?! I get half the herb butter and half marinara and put sausage, mushroom, onion and bacon on the marinara side and chicken, pesto, sundried tomato and garlic on the herb butter side. mmm so good.

Don't forget they put the pesto on AFTER they bake the pizza.

You pay and then wait for your name to be called and then dig in.  Each pizza has about 8 slices and they are pretty big.  Think about your pizza combos before you make them because some things just don't go together so don't become too eager.  The pizza crust is thin and sometimes can get kind of oily so beware of that too.

Overall, I love this place, customizable, fresh, tasty, AND they also have gluten free options. A win overall :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Perks of going to school right next to this pizzeria. It's so rare that I go bc you'd expect to eat here on the usual but not so much. Pizzas good love it here. I don't even think I can finish a whole pizza by myself and it's pretty small. You get to put your own toppings and sauce which is pretty cool. I add a lot of meat bc I'm a meat head :D my friend Tracy gave me a tip to get pesto sauce on the side and extra garlic :) mm mm mm so good<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">ordered online for takeout. online order process is fairly easy. i found the pizzas very tasty and thought the toppings were pretty generous. solid value for the price. the main disappointment was that the crust (except for the edges) was not very crispy. it may be better to eat in than doing takeout. also, if you're REALLY hungry, one pie doesn't quite do it and 2 is overkill, so you may want to arrange for a salad or appetizer. notch bigger pizza and crispier crust and this is an awesome casual dining destination. went before csuf started, so it might be a zoo during peak times right now.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I lovelovelove the concept of this place. Basically it's like a Subway but for pizza, and some darn good pizza at that! You can build your own pizza or choose from a preset list which kinda makes you doubt your own ability to build a good pizza, lol! I really enjoyed the #5 and I think the thin-crust is terrific! Finishing one pie by yourself is pushing it a little bit but the price is right so you might as well NOT share and save the rest of it for later. Fresh, delish pizza for an affordable price. YES PLEASEEEE.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">had my first "pie" the other day. it was amazing. it's made fresh and directly in front of you. the different doughs, sauces, vegetables, meats, condiments, you're literally able to make thousands of combinations. it's good food and a pretty good price. whenever I'm craving pizza I'm willing to come here and get a pizza I created myself.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Cheap, good and you can create your own pizza.
It's not like THE BEST! But it's good enough so we eat here every once in a while. 
It's like a 3 and a half stars for me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome place for pizza!! It is like subway, but for pizza. It's pretty simple, build your own pizza just the way you like it with UNLIMITED TOPPINGS and enjoy!! Come check this place out<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My cousin says this place is always busy, but what do you expect, it's a college town!  I really like their model.  The layout of the place and how the food is made in front of you makes this the Chiptole of pizzerias, which means it's going pretty darn good with Chipotle franchises popping up everywhere (my bad if you HATE Chipotle).

For about $8 you get a bigger than expected personal pizza, and you tell them what you want on there starting with the sauce, cheeses, meats, veggies, and other toppings after it's baked.  I had the herb butter, red sauce, all of the cheeses, peperoni, sausage, mushrooms, olives, peppers, and pesto after it was baked.  It's a thin crust, so it doesn't take very long for them to bring it out nice and hot.  It was a very good pizza for a phenomenal price, and pretty cool atmosphere but no tvs, so it's not really a place to go with folks to grab a pie and watch a game.  But still, great vibe, good food, and good company.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology is definitely the most Chipotle-like customize your own pizza place. There are a great choice of toppings and the staff is very helpful in helping you order. The wait time was a little longer than I expected, but the finished pie was SO delicious. 
 I advise going early in the evening. The line gets really long during peak dinner time!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">4.5!!!  I'd give it a five if they had sun dried tomatoes!!! I got a pizza with red sauce, mozzarella, parmesan cheese, bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and fresh basil.  After 5 minutes, it came out, i took a bite of it.  Something was missing. They were super nice to add bbq sauce on it and that totally hit the spot!  I think my second visit here was even better!!  I'm coming here more often now!  

I tasted the other pizzas that my group created and the sausages were delish as well as the roasted peppers and pepperoni!  YUM YUM!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't know much about history
Don't know much "Pieology"
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the "Italian" I took

An adaption of an oldie but goodie, just like this place which kind of re-invents a very old food concept.  Sometimes less is better.  When I was in Rome earlier this year, I had a "Roman" pizza at a tiny place around the corner from the Vatican.  I had never heard of a Roman pizza.  All it contained was chicory, anchovies and a drizzle of olive oil on a rectangular crust:  I thought it was the best pizza I have had in my life.  Similarly, I never took Italian in school, but what I did learn was self-taught via a dictionary, verb book and phrase book.  I wanted to impress a girl I was visiting.  After 6 months of e-mailing her only in Italian, she decided she liked me better speaking English.  WOMEN!  There went my $50 in books!!! - LOL

I came here after reading my Yelp sister Maila H.'s review (she's Hawaiian/Filipino just like me - She's also much better looking!).  The menu is very simple as are the pizzas.  They have pizzas, salads, drinks and ding dongs (Yeah, you heard me right, ding dongs for a $1.50!).  You can make your own pizza (including gluten free crust for $1 more), or you can choose from the seven standard pizzas, including an eighth which is the Pizza of the Month.  All of the pizzas are $7.50.  Full salads are $7 and half salads are well, half price.  

The Pizza of the Month was Thai Chicken, which reminded me of CPK, so I ordered the #5 instead - Mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta, basil and olive oil.  Pizzas are made to order and come out in about 5 minutes.  The crust is super thin, which is fine by me.  I prefer to taste my toppings vs eating a gutbuster Pizza Hut version that is all crust.  The cheese is super fresh and the combo of mozzarella, parmesan and ricotta was well thought out.  The basil and olive oil are a nice touch because I don't care for red sauce on my pizza:  4 Stars.

I also had a half classic salad that came with walnuts, cranberries and feta cheese.  The salad was a nice finish after the pizza which, as you can imagine was super rich with all the cheese.  My entire meal was $15 (with a $1.50 soda and tip), and I was pretty full afterwards:  4 Stars.

The ambiance is minimalist, but pretty clean.  The Manager stopped by to say hello.  The staff is very friendly and efficient.  The place was packed at noon on a Mon, so I was glad that I arrived early.  This place is about a 15 min drive from work and well worth it.  I can't wait to learn more about Pieology! (As for the Italian, maybe I need to find a new Italian gf - LOL!).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology in Fullerton 

I love this place.  I'm a regular here go just about every week and get the meat lovers and I'll try different build my own. It always comes out just right. 
I love the thin crust. I usually get half red sauce and garlic herb.  Every pizza I get here has me coming back every time. Tip to avoid the crowd go around 2-4pm weekdays.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The Subway of pizza. Love the ability to customize my pizza and load it with all of the things I want! Great price for it, considering I stuff my pizza like nobody's business!

Great that they have a gluten-free crust when I wanna get healthy with my pizza slightly! hahah<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome.

Chipotle style custom personal sized pizzas.

Get in line and pick your crust, sauce, cheese and toppings. They have really good gluten-free crust and tons of different choices to customize your za.

It was just about the same price as Chipotle would cost ($7-$8) and you get a good sized pizza. 

The décor looks pretty damn close to a Chipotle with its own little personalization (random quotes on the walls and shit).

I loved it and will def come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I totally LOVE the concept of this place! Exactly what most of everyone says - think Subway/Chipotle style ordering but with pizzas!

Located in the bustling area of Chapman and State College next to What's Up Men, this place rocks. Don't be threatened by the long lines, it actually goes by pretty fast.

The menu's not that big. They offer 7 types of pizzas to order from OR you can customize your own. Either way it's $8 and if you don't want carbs they also offer a salad alternative. The pizza's are thin and portioned perfectly for one person. I almost always order a #3 which is basically a BBQ chicken. A delicious BBQ chicken at that! Sometimes I feel rebellious and customize my own but most of the time it's the #3. I also order the cinnamon sugar strips which are sooo sweet and cinnamon-y!! It's a great appetizer or dessert. Either way it's bomb!

Looking for something cheap, fast and real good? College student on a budget? Couples on a budget? Fulfilling a pizza craving? Fulfilling a carb craving? Pieology's PERFECT!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">For the longest time, I could not understand why people rave about this place. So I caved in and we came to try, despite being lactose intolerant ;)

Their pizza is awesome and for only $7.95! You customize it, any way you want it. More chicken? Sure here's more. More pesto? Sure he's more! More mushrooms? Sure here's more! You get the point.

We usually get one pizza with mozzarella, pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeno and another pizza with pesto, chicken, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, extra garlic with extra pesto to dip. Two pizzas are more than enough to feed me, Mr., and the tiny tot (who's not so tiny anymore).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome joint. I am not a huge fan of pizza (I know) especially thin crust pizza but this Chipotle concept is awesome.

So the concept is build your own pizza, or you can choose one of their concoctions. But basically you pick and choose what you want on your pizza. As many or as little toppings as you want and its all only $7.50. It's a small pizza about 11" or so but it can be packed with goodies.

It's not too big of a serving, as I was able to eat the whole thing myself (I am a fatty) but I normally have only 2 slices of thick crusted pizzas. Good eats, fun spot, and great quotes on their interior wall decor. Methinks I will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Four stars for gluten free pizza! Went here to have lunch with a friend, and ugh, my pizza was so good! 

$22 for two pizzas, not so bad. =)

Will definitely be coming back here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love my experience here, and build your own pizza? build your own any food should be a win win!

You come in lining up as other's said (Chipotle style of pizza) 
Once greeted up front you then start building your pizza, 

Starting off with the sauces (your choices): 
Red Sauce
Herb Butter
Olive Oil

Cheeses:
Mozzarella
Ricotta
Parmesan
Gorgonzola

Toppings Meat:
Pepperoni
Sausage
Meatball
Chicken
Ham
Bacon

Toppings Other:
Black Olives
Mushrooms
Red Onions
Green Peppers
Artichokes
Tomato
Pineapple
Jalapeños
Fresh Basil
Cilantro
Garlic



I had the medium size (about 7.50, all the toppings you want) I had extra red sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, olives, mushrooms, cilantro, and garlic.

I also ordered a side of "herb bread" i loved it! with a size of marinera (free) 

the service is quick, fast, friendly. The greatest part is that it truely tastes fresh! doesnt feel like your drowning in heavy oils of pizza. thin crust wins!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Subway/Chipotle version of Pizza! 

Pros:
 A++++ for Originality
Inexpensive
Variety of topping choices
In and out less then 10 min

Cons:
The asian girl working there was rude. I asked her for extra cheese and she looked at me as If I was dumb. She was probably just mad cause she was Fugly.

Overall, with the exception of the female worker I would come here again. My pizza was DELICIOUS and inexpensive. Can't go wrong.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is legit! Normally hyped up stuff gets me skeptical but as soon as we bit into our pizza, our eyes widened in satisfaction. It's a perfect thin crust, and all the sauce/ingredients were fantastic! Being such a thin pizza, it came out super quickly as well, and delivered to you at your table. I really like that you can customize your pizza any way you like, assembly style, and it's all one flat fee ($7-8). If you're not too hungry you could easily share half of it to be even more cost friendly, or enjoy the entire thing yourself. Since I'm a fan of not so overwhelmingly red sauced pizza, and I looove garlic, this place really is great for me with all of the choices! I'd love to try different combinations. I really dig this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology is still the best tasting build-your-own pizza chain I have come across.  Sometimes it is so crowded that the line goes out the door.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You have to go at the right time or you get crazy lines, and rude staff in a hurry. But they have the world's best gluten free pizza. I love the BBQ chicken one- makes this gluten free thing almost bearable. Although half the time they forget to put BBQ sauce on my BBQ chicken pizza so I have to take it back to get it fixed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It took me 20 minutes to order and the line was not long at all. Then it took another 15 mins to pay and receive my pizza. I would have gone to a sit-down restaurant if I wanted to wait 35 mins to get my dinner. I don't usually write reviews but I had plenty of time to do so since I'm waiting for my pizza. However, the bar servers were nice and the pizza tasted pretty good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It was my first time here last Sunday and I was amazed! $9 for a full pizza and you get to customize however you want it to taste like! What threw me off though was I thought we could choose our own dough but the lady already had it pre made already.. Definitely coming back here this weekend!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is awesome!  Great pizza (s) for a reasonable price!  

They have their signature "Build your own pizza" for roughly $8 plus tax.  You can choose as many toppings as you'd like and the options are great. They also have a cinnamon sticks for roughly $3 as well. 

If you go here,  just be prepared to wait a little while due to the long line of hungry customers!  Overall,  this is a great pizza joint for a reasonable price!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place serves really delicious pizza if you make it right. But if you make it wrong, then you will have not so delicious pizza. What I say is correct.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I decided to check this place out since I saw high ratings on Yelp.

Stepping inside, I felt this whole Chipotle vibe. The colors, the set-up, seating arrangement. Everything just reminded me of Chipotle. There's also quotes on the wall.

Basic premise is you choose whatever toppings you want on your pizza for a flat rate of $7.50. That's like super cheap. They also have preset orders if you really don't know what to choose. Like the #1, #2, yada yada.. Once you're done with your topping selections, they put it in a modernized brick oven. 

It wasn't crowded at all when we went, which was great! We went around 4pm-ish. There were lots of seating available. We waited around 5 minutes for our pizzas to get cooked.

I admit I was skeptical at first because of the way it looked before it was cooked and also I was never really a fan of thin crust pizzas. But oh wow, once I tasted my first slice, I was sold! The red sauce, the cheese, the toppings tasted great! The only problem I had was that the crust was a little burnt. Otherwise, everything was good.

Will be back here for sure!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yeah this is the Chipotle of pizza...

This is not a gourmet pizza place, they never claimed to be a Neapolitan style conformist so I won't roll up on them for anything like that.  What they are is a Chipotle-style assembly line complete with minimally interactive robotic humans that will assemble your pizza to your specification;  not hating, but I understand that they're just slapping together pizzas for the masses...

For my initial attempt, I got the closest thing to a Neapolitan pizza off of the standard menu:  a #5.  It came with large tomato slices which I could have probably told them to hold off, and the basil was a rough chiffonade instead of whole leaves which is also fine http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton#pM77KS_KDektewqyM4vVSA.  The #5 also comes standard with garlic, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese.  Not bad, just a bit sloppy;  I wish they would cut it into smaller slices like 6ths instead of just quartering it, I think this would go a long way towards holding up better http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton#Fgv5cN7kW2SLBtY4sl5XXA.  Aside from that the plastic utensils are barely of any help...

My better half got a #3 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton#5IKdIfAIQILDYcaaboCcTg and added some roasted red peppers to it to kick it up a notch.  The BBQ sauce and chicken, along with the gorgonzola and cilantro, was mighty tasty... 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton#VnFkEfzdrZt0-wrNrrKb5g

The Ding Dongs threw me off.  I bought one mainly of curiosity, but they're nothing special.  I can buy 12 of them on sale at the market occasionally for $2.50.  Although they also have bottled drinks, I can say that the syrup/CO2 water ratio is working fine at the help yourself soda dispenser... 

The five stars is for a fully customizable individual pizza for the incredibly reasonable price of $7.50;   at this price everyone in your party can get whatever they want.  The crust is slightly on the thin, closer to a flatbread side.  This is particularly significant if your "eyes are bigger than your stomach"  and you start to pile it on with the variety of toppings available, perhaps beyond the point where the crust can easily support it all.  They do have a $6 cheese pizza for minimalist cheapskates and starving students to go with their menu of a half dozen preconfigured pizzas for the decidedly undecided...
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton#hHkH2-jqHQXwU24J_4G1aQ

The dining area has some warm touches like leather lined sofa booths to go with it's otherwise simple furnishings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton#DQDGecqmc9V8G7uzRMM9vg.  The sayings and proverbs on the wall encourage interesting topics of banter http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton#4ufdJ1vzzDrDsJy2QczH6w.  The clientele is mostly early 20-somethings perhaps from the nearby CS Fullerton student populace...
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton#ClNf07m37JUd5x8Lcr49Jg

The food is probably more like a four star, but the value and convenience brings it up to five stars.  The idea is catching on with other places like Blaze Pizza at the UTC at UCI.  I will be back...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pretty darn good.

I prefer the taste of 800 degrees in Westwood's crust. But, Pieology wins at toppings. They have a bigger variety, and it's unlimited!!! I am a big fan of asking the worker to pile on ricotta & sausage.

I don't do pizza very often, but I'd definitely return.


*I do wish they had sambal though. :'(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tasty, quick, easy, friendly staff.  I don't go often, but when I do go I always have a good experience.  There can be times when the line is long...but it moves quickly enough and it's only long because the food is delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Think Chipotle but with pizza!  If that doesn't intrigue you, we cannot be friends!  Decided to stop by for lunch on a Saturday afternoon after passing this establishment several times, it peaked my interest.

Upon entering you get the very familiar sense of chipotlesque set up, etc.  There is music, lots of patrons and the aroma of pizza deliciousness.  There are several popular pizza options, as well as making your own pie. They have what seems like an endless list of ingredients to choose from.  Just like Chipotle, you are greeted and asked what you'd like to have, you simply let the pie artist what you'd like to have that day and they whip it up right in front of your eyes!

I ordered: Ricotta Cheese, Parmesan, and Mozzarella Cheese, Garlic, Pepperoni, Green Peppers and Basil on regular crust.  This pizza was delish!!!  Freshly baked and big enough for two people to split and enjoy!  It makes me want to come back again and again.  The price stays the same regardless of toppings, its great!

Pros:
Fresh Pizza
Gluten free options
Tons of choices
Clean
Friendly staff that seems like they truly enjoy their job
Great Food
Nice feel to the restaurant
Great for families and kids
Pricing is great!

Cons:
Location is sort of weird, the way it faces the street and not much parking close to the establishment.  Other than this not-so-important con, there is nothing to complain about.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fast service and always great quality!! Love the organization and cleanliness so much more than Blaze pizza!! Would pick every time!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is awesome! You can choose to make a custom pizza or choose one of the several selections that they suggest. And all for under $9! They also have salads too.

The crust is a thinner crust and big enough to have a couple slices left over if you are eating one by yourself. 

You can choose from garlic butter, olive oil or marinara sauce as your base (or a combo of these). I asked for garlic butter around the crust and marinara in the center. Yum! Gorgonzola, Ricotta, Parmesan, or mozzarella for the cheese options. For meats, theres pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, bacon, ham, chicken and spicy chicken. As for the veggies, they have the typical ones as well as cilantro and garlic. They even have several things you can add after your pizza bakes!

They also make a dessert pizza with cinnamon and sugar and an appetizer pizza with garlic butter. And the pizzas really dont take long to bake. 

If you havent tried this place, then youre crazy, because its really that awesome!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Finally popped my Pieology cherry last night. Its pizza Subway/Chipolte.

Pick from one of the standard issue deals or make up your own as you go along. Pretty cool concept. Except the same lame problem that others like Chipolte and Subway have. The staff is just a little below par in the head cheese department.

So I ask for a #2.
 "Two pizzas" she replied
No just a #2.
 "OK 2 number twos"
No one #2!
" A number 1 and a number 2?"
NO I ONLY WANT ONE #2 PIZZA!
"Oh, OK one #2 pizza"
Yes you got it. (Finally as they begin to still make 2 pizzas)
"Hey (insert name) he only wants one"
Guy stops making second pie.

Felt like I was doing the who's on first thing. 
Have them add shrooms onions and jalapenos to my #2 meat lovers pizza.
 Then to top it all off the cashier asks me if I wanted 2 Iced teas to go with my pizza!
Did I have a #2 tattooed on my forehead while I was sleeping?

But after a short wait I got my pizza. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/X_4ILa4wqmiw445WBUGBgg?selected=zlJMAxUOBwCiNG_StFb0Yg#v_jxMixm0p_JwS5dsRNdXg
Hey this pizza ain't half bad, tasted good and had all the crap I like. The guy who dreamed up this pie must be a genius. Not so quick smarty. The onions and peppers are hardly cooked, just eat it and remember next time to tell them to cook it just a little longer  4+****Star food

Take my word for it this kind of pizza will be the Subway of pizza, these things will be popping up like Starbucks. Whats not to love? Cheap, quality pizza, that you can customize to suit your on tastes!

Service 3***Star (they finally got it right)

I'll be back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been trying to call for the past 15 minutes, however all I hear on the other end is a busy tone. Guess I'll have to go to pizza press...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">C'mon. Someone lend me the bucks to get on board with a Pieology franchise! No? Then please, please, please Pieology ~ come to Tucson!

My sis-in-law and her family love this place so when we were visiting Fullerton, she took us there. I just love the concept and how fast and delicious the food is. I understand the lines can get really, really long especially at this location but it wasn't too terrible when we arrived. The line was to the door but it moved remarkably fast. Pieology has a list of seven regular pizzas but you can also make your own...which I did.

All pizzas are just $7.50 - no matter what you put on it! Amazing. You start with a personal size thin crust and select traditional sauce, olive oil or herb butter. Then you slide down to the cheese station where the choices are mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta or gorgonzola (!). Scoot a little further down to select from the various meats such as pepperoni, chicken, ham, sausage, meatball or bacon. More toppings await such as cilantro, jalapeno, fresh basil, sliced tomato, bell pepper, mushrooms, pineapple, red onion, black olives and garlic. Oh yeah, artichoke hearts too. Then they slide it in a very busy oven and within a few minutes your pizza is ready to eat in-house or get it boxed to take home. Incredibly delicious, incredibly fast and incredibly cheap!

I desperately want Pieology to come to Tucson and could see it being wildly successful down on University near the UofA.

So please, someone do it. If you won't lend me the money, let me be your partner. Or at the very least, give me free pizza for life to thank me for making you a millionaire.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hours are listed until 10 p.m. They have doors locked at 9:43.  Completely disappointed and will not come back to this location. If your hours are lists as 10 pm your doors are unlocked til then and customers are welcome in. Complete crap.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I wish I had discovered this place a lot sooner! If you love pizza like I do, then you have to give this place a shot. You basically get to customize you pizza with various toppings and sauces (think of it as like a Subway, but for pizzas). The price per pizza is only $7-8 and the pizza is decent (bigger than a personal size pizza). Most people get full from one order although I usually end up taking 2-3 slices to-go since I also order their cinnamon pizza which I also recommend (it is only $2-3!). The garlic slices aren't that good since they lack any strong flavor. This place gets packed with CSUF students around 11-1 p.m. (lunch time!) so just keep that in mind. If you can't wait, there is a Panera Bread and a Ramen place nearby.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You get to build your own pizza for the low price of $7.50!

When my friend told me about this place, I was pretty excited to try it. Request as many toppings as you'd like without extra charges? Sounds good to me!

Man was I in for a surprise.. When I got there, all hell broke loose. I was like a kid in a candy store. I seriously pointed at EVERYTHING and the staff member was very patient with me going back and forth in the trays of toppings when I spotted another cool thing to add to my pizza. After all that ruckus, they pop your pizza into a BRICK OVEN! I love brick oven pizza! And you wait for them to call your name when it is ready. You may also request for your pizza to be more well done if you like it crispier.

Seating might be a little problem because this place can get pretty busy, like... out the door busy. I suggest teamwork, one person orders while the other person hunts for a table.

My friend also recommended the cinnamon sticks, which comes in a pizza form but they slice it into strips. I saw many customers with this on their table and I fully regret not trying it.... It smelled so good! Maybe next time I'm in the area.

OH! And they have cute quotes from celebrities on the wall :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is genius!  For 7.50, the world, or pizza, is your oyster.  Choose from any number of toppings, or if the choices are too overwhelming, select one of the pizzas with already predetermined toppings.  Also for that price, you get a nice amount; I'd say around a foot in diameter; which can easily feed 2 people if you're not too hungry.  .  Naturally, the first time I came, cheap me got every topping available to fit on that pizza.  From the pepperoni to the basil, you get a plethora of flavor, and various taste buds firing.  I ended up eating the pizza all by myself because I willed myself to, it was that good, and I hate taking food home!  

The second time around, I shared the pesto and basil (#6).  With flavors concentrating around the basil, tomatoes, and pesto, you would be able to fully appreciate the tastes that comes with them.  It was a light pizza, and pretty delicious.  For dessert, we got the cinnamon sticks, which of course, is shaped like the pizzas.  It too, was light and not too sweet. 

If you're in the area, this place is worth a try as its uniqueness, quality, and bargain price is all great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Build your own pizza? Hell yes.

Unlimited, fresh ingredients to make your own pizza. Or you can choose from their 7 classic pies.  

#4 mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta, fresh basil, black pepper, olive oil: Sounds freaking delicious,but it was only okay. It lacked flavor compared to the other ones. 

#5: tomatoes, fresh basil, mozzarella, parmesan, garlic: Okay, this one was pretty good. Better than #4.

#6: pesto, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, parmesan, garlic: SO DAMN GOOD. OMG. My friend ordered it first and I tried a bite and it was better than what i had gotten. I was mad. So the second time around, I ordered this and it was delicious as ever. 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton?selected=jUKvkbvcoSkmZ8Hg-I00Wg#K4qerjkHHRnJk4qWB7JtIw

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pieology-pizzeria-fullerton?selected=jUKvkbvcoSkmZ8Hg-I00Wg#AK-7JRcqUIMitnot6VKvGg

My custom one was pretty good too. You just need to know what ingredients go with what. The first time we went, my friend threw all the ingredients on there. Way too much and he said he couldn't distinguish anything. So I suggest don't put every single ingredient on.  

And you can half-half your pizza. All for $7.50. Good price if you ask me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A custom designed pizza for $7.50. What more can you ask for?

I asked the worker for more bacon and pepperoni on my pizza and he didn't even judge me. I will most definitely becoming back here soon! Well, maybe not to this particular one since there's one open in Irvine now!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is by far the best build-your-own-pizza type establishment in LA or OC. It's owned by the brother of former tennis pro Michael Chang. Props to the food.

Why is it the best? They pile on the sauce, cook it to perfect temperature, and use fresh ingredients. Props to the founder. 

Think if it like Chipotle for pizza with the assembly line setup. It can get hectic in the end when they're popping out pizzas left and right. There has been more than a few incidents where my pizza got lost in the stack or was never made. Management is hit or miss. No props to management.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place, and have loved this place since the first time I came a couple of years back. Friendly staff and great food! Who doesn't like pizza on a budget?!? It's the Chipotle of Pizza!

Atmosphere: Always busy and noisy, if you need your quiet time during a romantic dinner this is NOT the place for you. Expect to see people of all backgrounds enjoy their food and buddies. 

Food/Drinks: The good thing about these type of places is that the food can taste good or bad, but in the end it was your choices that caused this. My advice is to add some Gorgonzola and Garlic to your pie. It adds to the flavor complexity. Also if you are looking to change things up add some BBQ sauce!

Price: $7.50 a pie! That's not bad, even for those of us that are more frugal than most.

I have also been to the one in Irvine & Puente Hills East... it never disapoints!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First let me say I have been coming to Pieology for several years now, and I love the Pizza.  There have been a few changes for the good, and a few changes for the bad.

This time I will have to say, it wasn't the most positive experience.  The pie makers this go-around were just downright unpleasant.  Yes there was a line of people, and yes we waited in line.  That doesn't mean you have to rush through, and keep trying to skimp on toppings, and making nasty faces when I ask for more.  When I ask for peperoni or ham that is what I want.. not just two or four tiny pieces, I want like a good amount.  I just want the management to know that we are watching, and have noticed the decline in speed, and amounts of toppings.  Is it really that hard to ask the customer if they need anything else?

Pizza was good as usual, but staff is on the decline.  Management better watch.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I give this place five stars because honestly there's a bunch of places like this where you make your own pizza and what not but this is just the best when it comes to taste,quality,and price. They've added new items! Only bad thing is there isn't one in every corner!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Customizing your own pizza?? I love this idea! You can throw whatever you want on and it's only about $8. I couldn't even finish the whole thing. My niece had ordered one and they gave it to somebody else on accident so not only did they make her a new one, but they also gave her a coupon for a free pizza for next time. Wish it wasn't valid only in Fullerton. Guess we have to wait till we visit there again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had pieology about 2 years ago and I thought it was good...I wanted to try it again and it didn't taste the same. Me and my friend's pizzas were all burnt on the bottom and outside on the crust and the toppings didn't taste very fresh. Pretty disappointing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am very picky about pizza but here you  can pick what ever you want.  Delicious pizza with wonderful thin crust dough.  You will get your pizza in 5 to 7 minutes lovely. Will definitely come again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizzas are good. Definitely should try once if you haven't. Service is terrible, however, especially during rush hours. Prefer Pizza Press over Pieology because employees are nicer and the atmosphere is a lot better over there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Finally I had my taste of Pieology. I heard about this place when it opened from my cousin who attends CSUF. It's within walking distance from her apartment too. So every time I drive up for a day in Brea/Fullerton, I go for a new treat of awesomeness that Pieology has to offer. 

Make your own pie or choose one of their signature ones, either way it's $7.50!! What a great deal. especially for the students who are mostly broke. Thin crusted and so tasty. You can add as much or as least as you want, however you want it.

It's quick and  friendly service. I'm a big fan. Another place added to my list of awesome places to eat at while in Brea/Fullerton.

I want more!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place!  It reminds me of a Chipotle, but with Pizza.  You pick your toppings and sauces all for a flat rate of $7.50.  Not too bad if you ask me :)
Usually I can get two meals out of my pizza, so it's definitly worth it.  Try out this place if you like pizza and unique eats!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Overall: 
This is like the chipotle of pizzas meaning you can create your own perfect pizza for ~$7.50. This is also a thin crust pizza, which is great for a light, but filling lunch/dinner. I'm giving a 4 for the food, but this location had bad service. I don't care even if they are busy at night, it would be better to be more considerate to every customer regardless. I might just take my business to another location, I heard Irvine had better service and is more generous with their items. 

Food: 
Of course the thing that lured me into this place was garlic!!! I was so excited to create my own pizza because sometimes I like certain items more than other. I was spiltting a pizza with my friend so on his side, we added sausage, pepperoni, bacon and every meat item that they had. On my side, I added EXTRA mozzarella, purple onions, pineapple, olives and TONS of garlic! I was a little disappointed that they were so busy to ignore the extra request of garlic I had asked for. It only took my pizza a few minutes to cook, which was awesome. 

Drinks: 
Bottled drinks or refillable soft drinks on the side

Service: 
I don't know if they were just busy that night, but I did not care for the service at all. First there are like 5 people handling one pizza. I think the first person ask how many pizza you want and the sauce, and then after they slide it over to the person to add meat, and then again to the person to add vegetables. I felt a bit rushed and they were kind of impatient with my order. I know they were busy, but it was my first time and it was really rude that they didn't even give me 5 seconds to pick my food. I had to keeping asking them to put certain condiments on my pizza. 

Environment: 
I heard this location is larger than the Irvine one. There were about 20 tables. My 20 friends and I were able to come here for a birthday party and still sit comfortably, even though we had to save a bunch of tables.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worth the drive and the wait if you like pizza with custom toppings for a fair price. Sometimes it is hard to find a seat..... Plan a trip there then stop at Smart and Final (in the same parking lot) and stock up on school snacks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is pretty solid.  The food is CHEAP, DELICIOUS, and comes out FAST!  Now that I have your attention, let me explain how it works. This place is like Subway but you are making your own pizza.  

Anyway the way it works is you pay a fixed $8 for a personal pizza and you are granted the option of putting ANY toppings on it at no additional charge (similar to Subway).  They have a huge options of ingredients you can put in like ham, bacon, mushroom, garlic, basil, red peppers, pesto, etc.  Once again you can put as much of this on your pizza at no extra charge.   

They have pre-made options like Meat Lovers, BBQ chicken, etc.  I'd recommend picking a pre-made option and adding the stuff you like on top of it.   I picked up the meat lovers pizza and added garlic, mushrooms, and some bacon on it and it was pretty solid.  My friend did the #6 (pesto, red peppers, roasted garlic) and added LOADS of basil, mushrooms, bacon, and some chicken on it.  Both were good.

Anyway the cook will throw all your toppings on your pizza, they put the pizza in a FIRE (yes fire!) oven and bake it four about 3-5 minutes.  Me and my friend literally just got our utensils and sat down and they called our names up within 2 minutes of paying.  The pizza comes out super fast.  The pizza is thin crust so It's not super oily, but if you are a big guy it may not fill up your appetite either.

What I like about this place is if you get bored you can always try new stuff by making crazy combinations of pizzas.  

I feel like people who are under "certain influences" (lol) *wink wink* will  dig like this place 'cause they can put EVERYTHING on their pizza and BLOW THEIR MIND AWAY at the concept!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We were searching for pizza in the area and Pieology came up highly recommended. Forwarded the info and a couple of our friends went to go make a pizza run.

They came back with 3 pizzas. Evidently, you can make any concoction for $7.50. Yes, any... 

From what they told us, the pizza was ready in less than 10 mins. It was super busy, but they made it out very quickly.

The 3 pizzas we had were the meat lovers, BBQ chicken and artichoke. I really LOVED the meat lovers pizza!!! 

Cheap and fast. We liked the pizza so much we were even craving the pizza the following day and we considered going back for lunch!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizzas good.  Salads meager so order only if you're dying for greens.  Chipotle for pizza is perfect description. Great service. Very loud. Kid friendly. $6 cheese pizza is even better than round table!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A bit pricey but the pizza is slightly better than mediocre.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">NEVER AGAIN.

I used to go here when I'm craving pizza, but the quality has just depleted. The second to last visit I had, the pizza was not fully cooked! It was soggy and was not enjoyable.  

The very last time I visited was on 10/1/14 at around 6PM (Wednesday Night).  The pizza again was not fully cooked, but this time I had the worst food poisoning.  I have never had food poisoning before so this was a traumatic experience for me.  I went home around 9PM (after class) and I felt very ill.  I actually did not sleep at all, but instead spent hours vomiting out the meatball, bacon, and some other toppings and being on the toilet.  I could not sleep at all because my stomach was in so much pain. 

Now I'm infuriated because I have to skip my quiz this morning because I'M STILL in pain.  

Maybe someone sneezed on my pizza or something happen, but this is absolutely unsanitary.

I would definitely not take the risk of this happening again.  Such a disappointment.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Even though my pizza was enjoyed by another patron, (just a mix up) the manager was super nice and apologetic! She made me a new pizza and gave me a dole whip (they are testing them out here) to enjoy while my pie was being made. Excellent customer service! I'll definitely be coming here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The only downside is that it gets super crowded during peak hours. Reasonable prices, fast, completely customizable pizza.  The Subway/Chipotle of pizza. You have to try it. 

This is THIN crust pizza by the way!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So if you've never been to a Pieology, think of subway but instead of sandwiches you get personal pizzas. 

It's a great concept, you walk pick the crust, sauce, and toppings. If you're not feeling creative you can order off their favorites menu. There are plenty of meats and veggies to pick from and you can even get fancy with the bbq chicken or blanca (all white pizza). At around $7-8 its not a bad deal considering that you can probably get two meals out of one pizza or split 1 between two people. 

I'd classify pieology as a fast food joint, you order off a board and have your food in about 10 minutes. Being close to CSUF, the place can get packed around lunch time. The desert pizza for $3 is worth checking out. They bake a smaller pizza and toss it some cinnamon sugar and glaze for a great after dinner treat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It was busy when we got there, but we still beat the rush. We ordered a custom pizza and custom salad and they were AMAZING! I can't wait to go back!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place never ceases to get old. Service is solid, pizza is on point and I think you could last lunch and dinner if you do it right.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I want to make it clear, this is a weary 4-star review. It was a good experience, but my heart longs for so much more. Christina V. put it best: Pieology is definitely the Chipotle of pizza places. Tell them what you want, how you want it, get it, eat it, and enjoy.

Pros
+ It's a fun, creative, and tasty experience.
+ You can have everything on your pizza for 1 low price.
+ $8.08 for every pizza, unless you add special stuff (which I'm not aware about).
+ Chicken, bacon, tomatoes, basil, mozzarella, onions, mushrooms, and a little bit of parmesan on red sauce LIKE A BOSS.
+ Savory, sweet, saucy, juicy, and the right amount of cheesiness.
+ Thin crispy crust.
+ When the line isn't horrendous, service is PRETTY QUICK!


Cons
- Thin crispy crust.
- I could easily eat 2 of these. Maybe 3.

If you love pizzas and you're a picky eater, Pieology is a good time waiting to happen in your mouth. I would definitely return, but even though the pizzas are sized appropriately at a meager $8, an any size, any crust, and an any-way-you-want-it-pizza from Pizza Hut for $10 is just as tempting.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology 101: the study of delicious pizza

Located right by Cal State Fullerton, it's a clever food option for the hungry college student.  Made-to-order thin crust pizza with all the toppings you want for $7.50 +tax, it's definitely worth the price.

I took the advice of my friends and tried not to get too greedy with the toppings.  It's like going to an AYCE restaurant.  Just because they say its "all you can eat", we really shouldn't be eating ALL that we can -- for the sake of our health and the button on them new skinny jeans.  With that in mind, you CAN add all the toppings you want -- I'm not going to stop you.  However, if you do that, you risk the chance of the veggies not cooking all the way through.  Not a huge deal, but the crust is super thin and the pizza only stays in the oven for about 5 minutes. FLASH BAKE!  I suggest you stay with your essentials for the best tasting pizza.

What did I order?? The best pizza I've had in a long time. 

Used option #5 to start off my pizza.  A simple mixture of tomatoes, fresh basil, mozzarella, parmesan, and garlic (perhaps too much garlic... I was burping that up for a few hours).  I added some sausage on there because I need my protein -- but this was a simple yet VERY tasty pizza.  Their pies are sauce free and just dressed with olive oil -- tomato or pesto sauce are optional additions.  

Yum yum yum.  My own crispy rendition of the classical Margherita pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quick Review: Not a thing really wrong with Pieology, they make adequate, custom made, thin crust pizzas that satisfy a craving. I just think Blaze is slightly better in every aspect.

Pros: North county location (bc Blaze is in Irvine), relatively affordable, tastes kinda like Blaze

Cons: Is not Blaze, is just missing that ineffable quality

I walked into Pieology with high hopes because my first custom pizza experience was at Blaze, and I did not like Blaze. I knew Pieology's reputation as king but from the minute I walked in I was put off.

I think their menu board is less user friendly than Blaze. Blaze offers a lot of premade selections, suggestions and you can build around those bases. Pieology is far more, build as you like and with the sheer number of toppings available, you could end up making a terrible pizza.

Everything is is hard to pinpoint, its just all the subtle qualities in the service, the details that doesn't really have as much character as Blaze but mostly in the end, the pizzas taste very similar. I went back to Blaze after and found their taste slightly more in my preference, without being able to describe what it is.

Essentially I think the pizzas are technically the same quality, and about the same price. I think Blaze might be slightly cheaper but its negligible. For what ever the reason, I just didn't find Pieology very satisfying, but I wasn't unhappy with my orders.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm a fan of the whole concept and though Pieology is the originator from what I have heard, they are not the best.
I have only tried PizzaRev to compare, but Rev wins by far!
We agreed the difference is kind of like a Lil Caesars Hot N Ready and a Papa Johns.
Worlds difference in quality.
Pieology has less sauces to choose from but did use pesto when I asked them to, as they have it as a topper at the end.
They only have already boxed Caesar salads that they add chicken to, but did comply when I asked if I could put veggies on there instead of chicken.
Rev, again a big winner offering any of their veggies or meats on there.
The selection of toppings is smaller and really just your average pizza toppings, nothing marinated, sautéed or flavored.
It was still a very good pizza and better than most other places, I was just missing the real wow this is amazing like I thought at Rev.
The line was out the door but moved fast, maybe a 15 minute wait and by the time we paid, there was seating and the food was ready.
The reviews are right, it is extremely loud in there, so  much so that even my son was complaining about it and holding his ears closed.
I'd rather pay the 50 cent more at Rev and get a real gourmet pizza, but Pieolody is also great, love the idea of this, so simple and so good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the chipotle of pizzas!! Fresh ingredients, your order custom made right front of you and all at a super affordable price. You pay $7.50 and you can throw in all kinds of cheeses, meats, veggies on it and not get charged extra!! I love pizza and this place made me super excited and eager to throw in everything I could. For sauces I like the red sauce and the herb butter (that gives my crust a very delicious flavor) For cheeses, all of them!!! Mozzarella, gorgonzola, parmesan, heck even the ricotta, lets do this!! Cheese me up! For topics my favorite are: olives, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and garlic of course. And to make my pizza perfect for me, I choose pepperoni, sausages, and bacon for meats (they also have chicken, ham and meatball). I love the fact that its made to order, fresh and served right out of the oven. You can taste the great quality of these ingredients in your very first bite. I can never finish the whole pizza myself but I like to believe I can if I try. I know a lot of people tend to not like to eat the crust because it lacks flavor, well let me tell you this, the crust here at pieology  is different and its different because you decide what flavor you want in it. The crust is delicious, crispy and awesome to be dipped on the after bakes sauces that you can also request. I like the pesto or the extra virgin olive oil. 

Pieology also offers 7 set options of different pizzas if you don't feel like picking the ingredients for your own. They also sell salads (full and half orders) which are also fresh and crisp. 

The place is clean, a bit crowded on the weekends and has a laid back and relax atmosphere to it. Being that its near a college, it is over flowing of college kids. The workers are helpful as well, especially if you look confused. I probably had that crazy- excited-I- want-everything-cause-I-LOVE-pizza look when I walked in. The girl that took my order explained how it worked and just smiled at me haha. I love this place. Affordable, delicious, custom made pizza that will leave you satisfied. Recommended for any lunch or dinner when craving pizza. You won't get this amazing taste out of any delivery pizzas out there and def not for less than $10.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Finally got to try Pieology!! I loved the pizza and how everything worked. The place was very clean and It was fun being able to make my own pizza. The workers were really sweet and they gave me extras of everything I wanted. Also there is a large variety of toppings!!

I assumed it would take a while to get our food but we got it within like 10-12 minutes after ordering our food. The price is also pretty decent for a whole pizza with unlimited toppings!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is great. Can put as many toppings as you'd like. But the wait time is getting longer everytime I drop by. Love the crispy-ness of the pizza though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love pizza
with that being said
I did not enjoy pieology

i was super excited to try this place out
I mean build your own pizza?!
what da heck!! kewl!!

my eyes popped out at the sight of all the toppings available
as I went from the sauce to the cheese and to all the other toppings my mouth watered and almost shed a tear as I was waiting for my pizza to cook

as soon as I took a bite of my pizza
it tasted like disappointment

the crust was hella thin and flavorless
(im guessing to cut the cook time but still flavorless)

I don't know if it was the toppings that I picked or my unusual high hope for this place but something just wasn't right

I don't know if I will ever go back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really really love this place! I love how you can put practically any topping on your pizza pie and it's only $7.50! It's amazing! If you don't know how to custom make your own pizza pie, you can always pick the ones that they have on their menu and add on other toppings, like pepperoni, ham, pineapples, etc. 

The pizza pie comes out really quick and extremely hot. It's really fresh and the crust is really crispy! It's really delicious. I love how the cheese gets really stringy because it's so hot! Aside from that, the size of the pizza pie is pretty big, well for me at least, so I had to share mine. Nonetheless, it would be a waste to pass up this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Walked in the atmosphere was grand .while waiting , I read numerous quotes as the my mouth watered. Reminders of what toppings you can choose are plastered everywhere .  Once the pie was on my table ...I said grace and dug in. First nibble was a orgasmic experience. And any manners was them thrown out the door. I went hammer .. Ending in a felony... Yellow tape surrounded my plate.. It was a done deal...  I also recommend the cinnamon sticks...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is outstanding!  The customer service is outstanding!!  Clarissa (?) Was absolutely amazing!

Okay, now that I've gotten that out of my system....
We came here because we were dying for pizza but didn't want to settle on one flavor profile.  Here you can build your own "personal" pizza for $7.95 with as many sauces, cheeses, veggies, and meats as you want.  My fiancee chose one of their preselected pizzas (#3), and he loved it!  I got mine with almost everything (marinara, pesto, mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, black olives, onion, bell pepper, garlic, artichokes, meatball, and pepperoni)... it was the start of the show!  I highly recommend it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology's pizza always tasted great, but their service has been improving immensely. I remember when I first came to Pieology, I was met by grumpy workers who gave meager topping portions. But now, I don't see those workers anymore and I'm always greeted with a smile. They bring your pizza to your table after you sit down, and they take the extra effort to ask you if you need anything.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There's nothing wrong with a build your own pizza joint that's totally affordable.  You get in line, and when you reach the front you get to pick between a red sauce, an herb butter, or I can't remember what the other options were.  Then, there's all kinds of cheeses.  Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Parmesan, ricotta, Oh my!  Of course I get ALL THE CHEESES.  Next are your meat options.  Chicken, pepperoni, sausage, meatball, bacon, ham!  Then, there's all the veggies.  There are the basics like garlic, olives and jalapenos, but there's also fancy stuff like artichoke hearts.  After that, they throw your pie into the oven, and fire that baby up.  It's a thin crust pizza, and it usually doesn't take very long.  

There are so many options, I can't recommend just one.  You can also get a gluten free crust for $1 more if you wish.  

I like it, I mean...how do you mess up pizza?  Especially if it's covered with all the things that you love in the world.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Mmmm..Pieology!!  

I'm always craving pizza and what's better than a place where you choose your own toppings!?  This place feels and looks a lot like Chipotle and not in a bad way.  Service is pretty good, but can be slow if you're behind someone in line who asks to pile on every single ingredient possible to their pizza.  There are lots of toppings to choose from ranging from tomato sauce, pesto sauce, lots of cheeses, meats, veggies, pineapples...you name it!  Then they bake it in the oven and in a few minutes, your order is ready!  All for under $10!  It's kind of a loud environment and seating is very limited so it's probably better for smaller groups.

If you don't like thin crust pizza, it might not be for you, but if you're curious and you like to try different toppings -- please check this place out!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This isn't my first time at Pieology, but my first time at the original location in Fullerton! Love that you can create your own pizza or even use a pre-made pizza (can even add toppings of your liking to pre-made pizzas).

Short and simple: good quality, great taste, nice portion size, and best of all, decent price! 3 pizzas were less than $25!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow always walk by this place but tried it for the first time tonight.  For $8 a pie this is as good as it gets.  With an avg 4.5 star and for being just back from eating one of the best pizza in Chicago, I though it wouldn't be fair for me to give this place a review. But I guess a 5star would be a fair score for Pieology.  

The pizza itself is thin crust, there are 7-8 options you start off with by picking what you want as the base of your pizza, then you pick from a dozen plus toppings.  There are no limit of the number of toppings you want on your pizza, but my friend kept it simple with like 4 toppings, I can see myself going crazy and want a little bit of everything on mine.  

I went in pretty hungry, spitted the pizza with a friend but I still got pretty full from it.  Waited for about 10mins for the pizza on a Thursday night around 9pm.  If you got $8 to spend for dinner, you can't really find better place than this.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Three words-
Cinnamon sugar strips.

Delicious.
The pizza is pretty good, too. 

Seating can be an issue when it's busy, but that seems commonplace nowadays. 

Clean place, friendly staff, good food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've never ate at one of these, but the pizza was excellent. The ability to create your own combo at one cost was awesome! Definitely recommend and hope to be back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you're a pizza lover, this is the place for you! Everything is customizable, so you can make the pizza of your dreams. Personally, I think Pieology is better than Blaze. 10/10 would recommend.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Heard about it. Been asked repeatedly if I had been here and if so, was it as good as everyone says. After last night, I can finally answer those questions ... 

First off - when you can have it your way, it's always a good thing. And here, you can have it your way. So, unless the ingredients aren't fresh, which they were - if you don't like the taste of the mix of toppings you put on, it's your fault. 

It's inexpensive IMO and it's a simple concept. One size - choose your toppings, choose a drink and whether or not you want a ding dong - have a seat and wait for your name to be called - then eat! 

I had the #2 pizza, a water and a ding dong - $10 and change. 

Thin crust but not so thin it's like eating a cracker. Sauce isn't overbearing and there's enough toppings so it's not just cheese and crust. I enjoyed my pizza to where I finished the entire thing in one sitting. The cooks tending the oven were on the ball - as it was a steady stream of customers yet my order didn't come out raw or burnt. It was just right. 

I really like this place. I'll be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service was a little slow considering it was post lunch rush but the food was yummy. I split a create your own with marinara and herb butter with veggies and meats. They don't skimp out on the toppings and they tasted fresh too! As we were sitting down I noticed the shift manager (someone in a green shirt) coming to every table asking how we were doing. There was this one couple with a baby and she made sure they were comfortable, asked if she could get them a booster seat and also gave the child a side of pineapple. I didn't get her name but she has long dark black hair and I was very impressed how thorough she was.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great pizza! Great ideas of varieties!
I love the decor inside the restaurant. The acoustics inside make it very loud and noisy though. I brought my friend who is in a wheelchair, and it's not very spacious in here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology is waaay better than Blaze Pizza. The crust is a lot thicker and stronger, so your toppings don't fall off when you're holding the slice. They also slice your pizza better than Blaze does, so you don't have to cut too much of it yourself. You can create your own pizza and add anything you want on it for around $8 or purchase one of their signature pizzas. They have an extensive variety of toppings, and their meat selection is really flavorful. I always top mine off with barbecue sauce and extra virgin olive oil and it comes out perfectly delicious. The pizza itself is not too big; it's enough to serve one person. I usually give a slice or two to my boyfriend though when I'm not hungry enough to eat it all. I wish Pieology opened up closer to where I live, but whenever I crave build-your-own pizza, this is my go-to place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fresh pizza, assembly like style.  That sums it up pretty much, but I'll expand a bit more on the subject, since I gave it 5 stars.

You get in line, use the nifty hand sanitizer they have available for patrons, and when it's your turn, the fun begins!

You can choose one of their specials (predetermined ingredients = boring) or you can make your mind up on your own regarding the toppings.  Choose regular or gluten free crust, doesn't matter which since both are deliciously thin.

Then, the crust will be spread with oil (melted butter?) before they ask if you'd like red sauce on it.  Say yes, it's way yummy, nicely balanced.  The sauce is spread, and they ask you if you want cheese on it.  Choices are great - they have delish mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Parmesan, and ricotta.  You can have one, none, or all, if you choose!

You move on down, and there's an array of meat toppings to choose from.  Pick one, pick two, pick five, hell, who cares?  It's YOUR pizza!  Then you can have them pile on a multitude of fresh veggies (or not) before they pop it into the super hot oven to bake.

You then pay, add a drink and/or Ding Dong if you like, and wait for your name to be called.  The wait time is scant, so I never even bother sitting till after I've got my creation in my hands.

Piping hot, self-created pizza, great service, cute decor (literally hundreds of quotes on the wall) and a nice, clean place to eat ,, I'm in heaven.  Oh, and if you ask, they'll cut your pizza into 8 smaller wedges instead of the usual 4 :)

Definitely my go-to pizza place, especially at about $10 for pizza and iced tea.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">10x better than Blaze Pizza. The bbq chicken is to die for. I also tell them to add pesto sauce at the beginning and it tastes even better with that. Drooling just thinking about it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Because there are so many variations at this place, I will share the two I've had the opportunity to try:

Herb Butter/Parm/Mozzarella/Chicken/Pesto/Garlic - Pesto-liscious.  I am very picky about pesto, and coming from a place like this, I'm quite surprised that the pesto is above average.  Unsure if they make the pesto in-house, however it has a very bright flavor profile.  

Herb Butter/Mozzarella/Ricotta/Mushroom/Sausage/Tomato/Garlic/Olive - YYYYESSSSS If only they had a white sauce like a bechamel, this would be perfect.  Otherwise this combination was packed with good and well-rounded flavors.

Herb Butter: Don't even dare skip this.  It really takes your pie to another level
Mozzarella: Tastes like whole milk mozs.  Melts evenly and strings nicely
Ricotta:  Surprisingly better than most of what you find in a grocery store
Sausage:  Pretty typical.  Really strong on the fennel though.


OVERALL:  I love that the pizza is thin, which results in an extra crispy crust.  I am a texture person and love a good CRUNCH.  I almost wish I had more crust...

Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm a Pieology fan. Even as a native New Yorker (and by nature a pizza snob), the pizzas made at Pieology locations are well-made, reasonably-priced, and made with care. This location is no exception; my girlfriend and I came here before a basketball game at CSU-Fullerton and genuinely enjoyed ourselves.

One caveat: This place doesn't have the best acoustics. It can get crowded, and when it does, it can make for a situation where you hear every conversation except your own. Still, everything else is really solid, so it's a minor annoyance with all things considered.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I finally got to try Pieology after all this time.  My dad is obsessed with this place.  I can see why.  For $8 you get a thin crust pizza with all the toppings you desire!  As much as you want!  I was delighted to see that they even had cilantro as a topping, my absolute favorite whoo!  I'm all about the thin crust pizza so it was perfect for me.  Sometimes it can be a little bit undercooked (especially if you have a lot of toppings) so you can ask to have it extra baked.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great pizza- good prices for what they have, the amount of toppings you can put on but the crust is very thin so plan on folding it.   They can get busy so know not to come during rush hour.  I enjoyed it and the business seems to be holding up, so they must be doing something right. ;)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">FINALLY. FINALLY tried this place!!!

you really cant go wrong with this concept. customized pizza, all the toppings you can possibly want, for a great low price?? my pizza was delicious. the pesto topping i got on the side was a great dip. thin and crispy. and all my favorite toppings. yumyum.

It is a little loud, long communal tables, and employees yelling out customer names to locate their whereabouts for the delivery of the pizza. And there are A LOT of people. so its not the best location to meet an old friend, or to get much talking done. but if you are with a big group and need a quick easy meal, or you just need a quick easy yummy meal, yup this is the place to go!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I fucking love this place. 

Best idea ever. INGENIOUS. 
My friend took me here, and I was a bit unwilling because I had never heard of it before and thought it would take forever.  I usually hate pizza places because I hate waiting 20-30 min. after I order for my food to come.  Pie ology is NOT LIKE THAT. 

Although the line appears long, it moves pretty fast, and honestly you will spend so much time discussing what you want that even when it is your turn to choose you will be flabbergasted. 

We split a pizza ($8) with tax, we ordered t
1) typical mozarella && tomato sauce
 2)EXTRA sausage tee hee 
3) pepperoni
4) shrooms ;) 
5) artichoke hearts ( on half)
6) bacon ( on half) 

so 2 minutes after we paid our pizza was ready, how awesome is that? 
they basically put your pizza in the oven RIGHT after you choose the toppings, and since it is thin crust it bakes super quickly. 

the taste is indescribable, there are so many different flavor combinations you can choose and each one is delicious in its own ways, and since i am asian and cheap next time i am going to experiment and add even more ingredients hehe since it is unlimited toppings. 

i wanna try the herb butter sticks next time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">LOVE this place. You get to make your own pizza. I call mine "The Garden of Eden" my goal is to get them to add it to the menu. Lol

They have a great selection of ingredients to choose from and they now have whole wheat crust (my personal choice).

Only downside is that there can be a bit of a line if you go during rush hour lunch time. Should be expected given that each pizza is hand made to the customers' preference...it's worth the wait. 

They also get bonus points from me for having THE most generous military discount of any restaurant I've been too! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here on 5/7/15 and to my surprise the line was almost out the door, the furthest door from the counter. There were about 50 people ahead of me but for some reason I decided to stay. It was well worth it because even though the crazy crowd never got smaller, and their credit card processing system was down, the employees still had a great attitude and were working as fast as possible. Even though I had to wait 45 minutes for a pizza, it still felt nice to see a smiling face from all the workers.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Likes: An $8 thin crust pizza with all you can have toppings of your choice?!?!  LOVE!  I got all six meats and almost all the other toppings (except for the base sauce which I stuck with herb butter because I figured mixing sauces would taste weird.)  Overall delicious. I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  

Dislikes: I had my dad try some and he said it was salty.  I GUESS it could be...but I still love it<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love the whole concept of Pieology. You get one pretty hefty individual pizza with ENDLESS amounts of toppings ALL for $7.50!!! ! Now you don't have to contemplate between the pepperoni or the mushrooms or the ham or the chicken or that extra cheese. JUST GET ALL OF THEM!! Pieology also has a menu with their signature pizzas that you can just choose from or just get all of your creative juices flowing and make your own. I got the #5 with basil, tomato, mozzarella and added ham and jalapenos. 

The best part is, that the pizza is thin crust so  it was literally ready in less than 4 minutes. you HAVE to ask for the pesto sauce on the side. The cheese was oOey gOoey and the pesto added a creaminess to it that just hit all of my taste buds!!

They also have friendly employees as well! Very helpful for first timers and did not hesitate when we asked questions!

I can't wait to go back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was very impressed with Pieology! The portion, quality, and price ($7 for ANYTHING) are all great reasons to not only try this place, but also come back again and again.

Personal pizzas are often too small, but this is definitely the biggest personal pizza I've ever seen. I was full after 3 slices! 

The Chipotle/Subway style assembly is really brilliant. How come this concept hasn't come to pizza before?

I got a pizza with red sauce, extra mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and red onions. The char on the bottom of the pizza was great. 

If I had to make one suggestion, I think the sauce could be more flavorful. Next time I'll ask for more of it, and more pepperoni. 

All in all, a great dinner. There will certainly be more check-ins to follow at Pieology.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One star... Not for the food because the food was about 4 stars however the service was horrible.  

The pizza was great loved it but an employee I think Richard was his name killed my experience and I will not return.  

As we were finishings our pies this employee reaches over me without warning puts his underarm in my face and his ass on my daughters shoulder to take an empty tray.  Wait it gets better! Again this guy comes to wipe the table down while we were still sitting on it pushing crumbs on mine and my brothers leg.  Now I hate hate hate getting stuff on my clothes so you can imagine that I was close to losing my temper. 

I run customer service based businesses and I would be very upset if my employees treated my customers like that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pizza is great and extremely cheesy!! The staff was very sweet to me but a bit dry when talking to my girlfriend. The atmosphere is nice and pizza is ready quick but I would have to say that Blaze Fast Fire'd Pizza takes it in the end with quality and customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been a regular pizza fan of Pieology for long time. I regularly visited Irvine Spectrum location but since I got introduced to this location by one of my friends I have been driving almost 40 miles to eat at this location.  Reason are many, Professional,courteous and smiling young people working at this location.  Great management and serious sense of customers service. BEING pure VEGETARIAN I so not like any contamination in my food. While the Irvine store always gives disclaimer that contamination with meat possible, I found people at this store go above and beyond to cater my personal need and help me follow my beliefs. This is great example of respect to Diversity in our country. 

I loved that since I requested the lady who made my pizza changed gloves, made sure put clean vegetables from fresh supply and also the pizza oven handler made specifically special cleaning to make me feel better. WOW.I am impressed.  The store is managed well and if I am writing this review on my busy day at work one can imagine how good it might get..go on people go to pieology in Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Personal pizzas with a slew of toppings? It's amazing I went as long as I did before trying Pieology (and similar dining spots) a few years ago. This location is always busy, although not unbearable, even if the line reaches the door (the wait time really isn't bad as the turn around for prepping your pizza doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes). If you have genuine gluten intolerance or food allergies, the staff will change their gloves (although you'll often get a few eye rolls; many people are just ignorant to the ugly truth about food intolerances and allergies and how much havoc they wreck on people's bodies who have them), and they are relatively on top of avoiding cross contamination. I'd encourage management/leadership to encourage a greater understanding of the risks with gluten intolerance and Celiacs to promote a more positive service-environment for those who love the corporate idea of Pieology.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">$7.50 for a build your own pizza with UNLIMITED toppings is so perfect for a college student. There are so many of these make your own, hand rolled pizza places popping up everywhere lately -- 800 degree in LA, Blaze in Irvine, etc. etc. 

You choose every step of the process: 
-Base Sauce
-Meats/Cheeses
-Toppings
-After Bakes

My most recent concoction consisted of: 
- Herb Butter Base
- Sausage, Meatball, Ham, Mozzarella 
- Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Green Peppers, Olives, Peppercinis, and Garlic 
- Pesto Sauce 

You really can't go wrong with making your own pizza, just throw on whatever you like! But if you're having trouble, there is a nice list of pieology specialties ready to order.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A solid 5-star in my book!

I was told by the bf that this is the Chipotle of pizzas and the moment I walked in, I found out exactly why that is. You can build your own pizza for $7.50+tax, you definitely CAN'T beat that, especially with the unlimited choices of topping.

The way it works, you pick your:
1. crust (regular or gluten-free)
2. sauce (red/tomato, herb butter, butter)
3. cheese (mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan)
4. meat (chicken, meatball, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, ham)
5. vegetables (cilantro, mushroom, bellpeppers, artichoke, tomato, jalapenos, pineapples, garlic, basil)

My creation:
Regular crust, herb butter, mozzarella cheese, sausage, bacon, cilantro, mushroom, artichoke, garlic, basil

I love that they don't judge you when you keep naming things to put on your pizza and that you can do half/half that way it's easier to share. I would recommend sharing with another person unless you want to feel like a whale afterwards. The bf got his half with tomato sauce, sausage, meatball, chicken, extra bellpeppers and jalapenos so we were both happy campers with our halves.

It's definitely hard to do a dine-in for pizzas but they definitely got it down so thumbs up for that! Also, they have the little tables area for little kids that are closer to the ground - super cute and comfy (from the look of it, I didn't sit there, of course!). Oh, and they accept credit cards!

My tummy is extremely satisfied and so is my wallet (:<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hands down my new favorite pizza place! The line may be long some nights, but it's always worth it (and moves quite fast) :)

Great service, great crust that is crispy on the outside but chewy and soft on the inside! I always get the garlic herb and the marinara sauce combined :) You can pick from pre-designed pizzas or make your own! They'll even do 50/50 for you. I tend to make my own Hawaiian or Supreme or BBQ Chicken style pizza. The price is a flat $7.95 no matter how many toppings you add too! They also have topping sauces you can add in like pesto, etc.

The salads aren't bad either, and the cinnamon sugar dessert is so good, but so much for one person lol

It can get a bit loud inside the place if you're eating in because of the metal chairs/echo-ey environment. Pizza and service is still amazing though :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of our family's favorite places. We make sure to bring all our friends in to try it. The food is fresh and just how you like it, and the manager Clarissa is fantastic! Very welcoming and friendly!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is 4-5 stars!  Excellent thin crust pizza and super fast prep and line wait!  Salads are excellent too!  
I'm giving 3 stars because of the atmosphere. Even with the seating half full, it was so loud you had to yell to hear the person sitting next to you or across the table. On top of that, the metal chairs when moved on the concrete floor made a screeching noise like nails on a chalkboard!!!  FYI...the bbq Ckn pizza comes with blue cheese or Gorgonzola which is not typical for that kind of pizza and half of our table didn't like it. 
Next time, I will do take out because the pizza is excellent!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Well this place disappointed us tonight. We thought we'd give this place a try based on the high reviews.

Don't expect a quiet dinner here. This place was very loud and full of screaming kids. 

This is like the Subway of pizza joints. You stand in line and tell them what you'd like on your pizza and you get to watch them prepare it in front of you. 

While your pizza is cooking you seat yourself anywhere you'd like. The problem was we couldn't find anywhere to sit that wasn't near loud kids and/or dirty.

We finally did find a spot with only a few crumbs and old napkins on the table. We wiped that mess onto the floor and made ourselves at home.

We hoped that the taste of our pizza would be so divine that we'd overlook everything else. Sadly this was not the case. We found the thin pizza to be a bit undercooked and rather tasteless.

If this is the type of pizza parlor you enjoy I'd recommend Chuck E Cheese's. They even have games for the kids.

One good note is that the staff was pleasant and friendly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time to this place and I loved it! Create your own pizza is the best idea and for $8 it's a steal. Very tasty crust, fresh ingredients and super friendly and quick service. I will definitely be coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Like a Chipotle but of pizza!
I love this place - it's so innovative. I don't know how they manage to allow customers unlimited toppings for $8.00 but they've done it. And the overall quality of the pizza hasn't been compromised. It's an individual-sized, thin crust pizza for anyone wondering... 

I top mine with: tomato sauce, ricotta cheese, artichoke, onion, mushroom, cranberry, fresh basil and pesto sauce. It's meatless but full of flavor! I like sweet, savory and pungent notes in my food so this creation really hits the spot. 

Definitely will be  frequenting this place since it's such a good deal! The entire pizza can feed me twice =P<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OMG LOVE THE PIZZA HERE! The crust is perfect and you can put whatever toppings as much as you want for the same price. The pizza costs around $9 including tax but it's so worth it! I will definitely be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Make my own pizza? Challenge accepted.
Customization is all the rage now and pieology scores high points for allowing us to create our own special pizza.
It reminds me of chipotle with metal dining tables and chairs. 
Perhaps they're related somehow?
The line got long fast but the workers here get you out of there fast.
You go in, pick your sauce, dough, and cheese then it gets passed onto the next worker to choose your toppings.
Really cool and ingredients are fresh and you can see them in front of you.
Then the next worker works the oven and your pizza gets baked.
It's a thin crust style pizza and the worker will call your name to deliver the baked pizza to your table.
As for the taste? What's better than to eat a creation filled with your favorite toppings? 
I took my left overs home and even the cold version was tasty!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When I read Chad A's review a couple weeks ago, I immediately began to crave the pizza he had. So last night I went over to Pieology with a friend. I ordered the #6 and added chicken and bacon. My friend ordered a #2 and added roasted red peppers. He also ordered the Herb Strips.

As stated by others, this place is just like a Chipotle for pizza. I thought it would take forever, but it is actually a really efficient system. When I was done paying for my meal, I went to get a soda, and before I was done filling it up, my pizza was ready.

I liked my pizza. It had really good flavor and the thin crust was really good. It was also super cheap, for $9 I got a good sized pizza and a drink. I didn't care for the Herb Strips, there was some flavor that I couldn't identify, that I just didn't like. 

I would definitely come back here again when in the mood for some fast pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had to come here because of how good this place is and I was not disappointed. The lines are long but I didn't have to wait too long and I was able to get my pizza order within 5 minutes. I got mine made with garlic herb butter, marinara, mozzarella and ricotta cheeses, all the meats except for sausage, mushrooms and peppers. The worker topping the veggies ended up forgetting to add tomatoes but I guess it's ok.

The place was packed but I managed to find a seat. The workers shout out your name so holler back when you hear your name or do what I did and wave to the worker.

As soon as I took my first bite of the pizza I was blown away on how good it was. The perfect thin crust crispy texture with the garlic herb butter and the fresh ingredients made me savor each bite. 

I used the 10% off yelp deal when I checked into this place as long as I bought a drink so it was all good. $7.50 for all the toppings you want is a pretty damn good deal.

Restrooms were nice and clean. Staff was friendly except the guy that was on the veggie station. He didn't look too happy at all.

Only bad thing is the parking since there's a buncha other places here. Definitely worth coming here to try this awesome place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The comparisons to Chipotle are not far off. Pie-ology has the same logo concept, same cafeteria-style ordering system, same junkyard decor, and the same novel spin on a popular immigrant-American fast food.

The menu offers some appealing suggestions, but in my opinion the whole point of coming here is to DIY -- that is, to do it yourself.

Once you place your order, you are given a range of toppings from which to choose. Unfortunately, nothing too innovative or unique here. The choices are pretty much what you might find at any pizza joint. But there is something very empowering -- and certainly very American, I'd say -- about being able to customize your food. Maybe that's why places like Subway, Yogurtland, and Chipotle are so popular these days.

For my pie, I chose to go with bacon, red onions, tomatoes, and basil on one half; and pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapenos on the other. It was fun. It was liberating. And the combinations were pretty darn tasty if I do say so myself.

Having said that, I thought the pizza, as a whole, was just OK. The crust was nice and thin, but even though it was baked from scratch, it kind of had a frozen pizza quality to it. There was no blistering, no char, no chew. Ultimately, no big deal.

But I think Pieology is a great concept. In 5 years they will probably be as ubiquitous as Chipotle.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food:  I order the pizza with herb butter, various meat and veggies.  Can't really go wrong with customizing your own pizza.  

Price:  Average cost per pizza is $7.50.

Overall:  I think the pizza at pieology is decent.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Build-your-own pizza and then have it cooked to an irresistibly thin, chewy and crispy texture in the extremely hot pizza oven.  I love this concept!!!  We tried the #4 and #6, and the best part is that they let you add as much toppings to your heart's desire.  And cheese, lots and lots of cheese please! 

If you order the pesto pizza, the pesto is added AFTER it's cooked so it's nice and fresh & full of flavor. Yum!

We also tried the cinnamon sticks which turned out to be a whole dessert pizza for only $2! The same crispy/chewy/thin quality of the pizza in a cinnamon stick. So so delicious!!!  I love it here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Needed a quick dinner before heading to a pregnancy class at Kaiser Anaheim and saw a few friends check in here before.

Realized i've been to a place similar (PizzaRev) and found out this was the original quick order pizza joint. 

We kept it light on the pizza and went with a vegi pizza and a half salad (which is awesome).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It was good and the price is great.  Overall, not my favorite because it's very thin crust and I like thick crust pizza better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great place for made to order thin crust pizza. It's already been said many times in other reviews that this is the pizza version of Chipotle and that's exactly right. You can have one of their creations or make your own by choosing the toppings you want. My only advice is to limit your toppings. You may want to overload your pizza with every topping you see, but this will only create a soggy, limp pizza. Trust me, just choose a few toppings you love and you'll love your pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Piology is delicious. I definitely recommend it. This establishment in Fullerton is my favorite because of the excellent service. You also get many options to make your ideal pizza, but the people working there are just very polite!

I do have to say, however, that I wish they had an option for a thicker crust. I also wish they had cherry coke!!!! I had to settle for regular coke. Lol. 

I definitely recommend piology. You have to try it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Like Chipotle, but with thin-crust pizzas. 

$7.50 for a flat rate pizza, with whatever you want! Want 5 different meats on your pizza? Go for it! Vegetarian pizza? You got it! Whatever mood you're in, Pieology will deliver. Cinnamon strips are delicious as well - they use their pizza dough base, add cinnamon sugar and frosting, yummm!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ah, the Chipotle of pizza places. Brought a couple friends here for their first time since they were craving pizza. 

FOOD:
By Chipotle of pizza places, i mean the ordering style. You basically choose your own sauce, cheese, and toppings to place on a pre-made, pre-cut THIN crust dough. They then cook your pizza in a stone oven and 10 minutes later you have your own personal pizza. Lots of combinations you can make. The crust on the pizza came out perfect for me- nice crispy edges that aren't overly burnt. 
As a tip, don't go too crazy and add too much toppings or else the center of the pizza gets soggy. 
Overall: 5/5

SERVICE:
The employees are nice, although the line can get long because it's right next to CSUF. The pizza comes out pretty fast for a on-the-fly order type system. Self-service for most of everything else after you pay.
Overall: 4/5

DECOR/AMBIANCE:
Chill, casual atmosphere. Great for friend, family, or for a quick bite. The place is clean and neat. Not much decor on the walls besides quotes about how great Pieology is haha.
Overall 4/5



If you like thin crust pizza your way, this is the place. Endless combinations to create whatever you crave. The parking lot sucks because all the spots are so tight and the line can get long. But other than that, the food is great and worth trying if you're craving pizza.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best pizza I've ever had...... That's because I had 100% control of what I wanted on it.  One of the best places I've ate at in a while. Must go<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I LOVE PIZZAAAA!
I'm so happy to have finally tried this place!

I seriously could not decide what to put on my pizza that I was stressed out! lol, but luckily the pizza tastes good no matter what you put on it.  I literally put every ingredient on my pizza except chicken, bbq sauce, and pineapple.  My creating was a huge mess, but it was delicious! Thank goodness!

I love thin crust pizza, so it was perfect for me.  The crust was so tasty.  When I came in I saw a girl order the crust by itself and it cracked me up so hard I even took a photo of it, but after trying it I understand why.  

The place was super packed and I thought I'd never get my food, but they are surprisingly quick which makes me a happy girl!  I finished only half the pizza, so I think it's a good size to share for 2 girls.  

I really enjoyed reading all the quotes on the wall too, very entertaining. 

Enjoy!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Build-your-own pizza for $7.50? BEST IDEA EVER! After finding out about this on Yelp, this place has been on my bookmarked lists for like everrr. I FINALLY got the chance to try it with the best friend the other day for lunch. It's pretty easy to find with its huge sign and its situated on the corner of State College Blvd and Chapman.

So yea, build-your-own pizza? Can't go wrong with that! The crust is thin, which is no problem in my book and the way you get it built is sort of like assembly style, where each employee will add your various toppings onto your pizza. You can pick different kinds of cheeses, meats, vegetables, etc and it's all for only $7.50! If you don't feel like building your own pizza from scratch, you can order one of the pizzas they have off of the menu for $6. They have some other items like desserts as well, which I wasn't really paying attention to, but will have to check into next time. Anyways, with a drink, my total came out to be a little under 10 bucks. Pretty good deal if I do say so myself! I definitely enjoyed my pizza. It was too much to finish it all in one sitting (even though I was STARVING). I only managed to finish half and took the rest home to eat the next day.

The service was really good. The workers were really helpful when I didn't know what kind of toppings I wanted. And I didn't have to wait long for my pizza to come out of the oven either. I am DEFINITELY going to be coming back to this place soon.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology is righteous and for around 8 clams you get your own pizza the way you want it.  I prefer to number 2.  It comes standard with pepperoni, sausage, and meatball.  Pretty damn good way to start a pie.  I had the number 2 with extra garlic, mushrooms, and basil: 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/X_4ILa4wqmiw445WBUGBgg?select=5UE6F5Xg07GXhKKyR7-jOA

I know you could fill your pizza to the brim, but I'm traditional.  I like a pizza I could pick up with two hands and not have all the topping fall on my lap.  I really enjoyed the crust.  Echoing my friend Anita, it was just the right thickness.  I don't like too much crust.  It takes away from the toppings.  I don't like too little crust.  I don't like pizza crackers.

The inside is spacious.  There are a few tables with ridiculously short couches.  I'm guessing that's for all those lounging pizza eaters.  They also opened up the garage door while I was there.  It comes with a screen to keep those pesky flies out.  So far there is just this one super busy Pieology in Fullerton, so I hope they franchise all over the OC.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you never had a pizza from here then your missing something special. Personal pizza where you can customize your own topping and sauce and you don't have to share with anyone. Even though there's always a line it goes quick. If you like thin crust pizza than this is the place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place specializes in pizza and they do it really well. So don't go here thinking that their dessert menu is where their strength is at. 
Their business model is outstanding and they have very reasonable prices. 
I could write a full fledged review on it but won't waste your time. So far at the date of my post this establishment is rated at 4 1/2 stars. Whoever brought it down by that 1/2 point must not 'get it'.
If you're a true foodie... Go here. It's WELL worth the commute and experience. 

Word of advice: It's busy here. Very busy.  So if you want to have fun while waiting in the long line, look across at KFC which is visible from the left-side window.  You can have a good laugh trying to figure out why nobody's in that restaurant.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">YAY! Finally got to check this place out. I've got to say one of the few places for great custom pizzas.  Totally reminded me of Chipotle. Stand in line and pick which toppings to go in your pizza right in front of you!  I got half bbq chicken pizza and the other half built my own.  All for just around $7.5. The total wait around dinner time was around 15 minutes.

The meats already seemed like it was precooked, so all they need to do is just pop it in the oven and it's out within 5-10 minutes; Just so that the thin crust can be cooked, melt the cheese, and heat some of the veggies/meats.

My favorite was the bbq chicken.  
If you get the pesto sauce, makes your pizza a little oily~ but up to you.

If you get a lot of toppings (which I did.. oops) you need a fork and knife.  The crust won't be able to handle the heaviness. LOL

Btw, it was really cold inside the restaurant during dinner time, so make sure to bring a jacket.  Only downside is it made my pizza go cold really quick... 

All pizza lovers unite :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm addicted to this place. I've been gluten-free for nearly a year now so this is my splurge. I get the gluten-free pizza crust and top it with LOTS of the creamiest ricotta cheese. You can keep asking for more of any topping. I'm only bummed because I got excited when I thought I saw Italian squash, but it was cucumbers<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">*************Pieology..Finger Stickin, Licken Good!***********

4.5 Stars!

Make your own finger stickin, lickin good pizza: One Size, Any and All Toppings, Fresh Ingredients, Made by Hand for $7.50! This place has a doctorate in making pie..Pizza Pie! Chris D and Steven N, "Thanks Bra!"  

I ordered two Pizzas:
1) "White" pizza with olive oil, mozzarella and feta cheese, pepper, garlic, fresh tomato and artichoke hearts. Cheesy, mouthwatering good.

2) For the little one: meatball, pepperoni, sausage pizza with fresh tomato. I also ordered their dessert pizza which was AOK. Sweet cinnamon on dough covered in frosting.

~5 Star Service: This place has "Sam the Man!"
The guy that helped me was super nice. He was giving me free ding dongs and said the owners love ding dongs so they put them out on the silver platter. His name is Sam. Yup, Sam the Man! He reminded me of this actor from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." I hope the owners appreciate him. He walked me through the steps. It was his service that will make me come back. Thanks Sam!

~Location
The location is by Cal State Fullerton. There are two Chapmans so don't get mixed up. It is in the same plaza as Office Depot.  The interior is modern and actually kind of cool. I would prefer eating here than taking out. Easy Parking, Baby!

Pizzas were just my type. I love fresh ingredients especially the fresh tomatoes and artichokes. Can't get enough! 

Pieology, where pizza is" finger sticken, licken good," Fullerton...another reason the OC is the best place to live!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is the chipotle of pizzerias.  For those complaining that you can't order over the phone well its not that type of place.  Plus the pizzas take less than 10 minutes to cook.  If you want a quiet sit down family restaurant then this isn't the place for you.   This place is almost always busy and it can be nosy inside.   A lot of college age people hang out here but it's also great for the kids as you don't have to worry about them being too nosy.   This place is cheap, for the same price you can get all the toppings and extras you want.  I love the BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple and bacon.   They have good quality ingredients but I wish they got better cheese.   Give this place a try, you'll be happy. 

Pros: Cost, taste, atmosphere. 

Cons: Long lines, some unhappy staff<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Crowded. Our pizzas crusts were on the burnt side. By the way, we went there within the year but more than 5 months ago.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">sorry for the short review, here is the longer version:

its really really really good shit and its even better when theres no one around and no crazy bums starting trouble.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you're in Fullerton and craving pizza you can create your own customizable pizza at a reasonable price here! This place looks exactly like a Chipotle, except with pizza instead of a burrito. I like that there's lots of seating, that they have a lot of toppings, and that it is pretty cheap! Highlights for me were the wheat dough and the $2 cinnamon dessert pizza. 

I would say the location is kinda out of the way unless you are a CSUF student, so its definitely not worth it to drive here unless you are less than 10 minutes away. The service was good and the pizzas were done pretty quickly. Crowd is mostly college students, and you can probably expect a small line but not  too long of a wait. I wish they had an oreo pizza or ice cream pizza, but maybe that would sacrifice efficiency. 

Overall, this place is pretty good. Not as good as 800 degrees, but I'm a little biased since I'm a Bruin :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just ate and Daniel allowed us to try their cinnamon strips. "Oh My God" they were good. Don't eat here without trying them. They are the best. Great service, great food and great people.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Assembly line style pizza.  Its pretty good.  
And for as busy as they are, they get you in and out in a decent amount of time.  

Been here numerous times and and they are consistent.  Ive tried a few different things on the preset menu and made my own creations, but i just keep going back to their BBQ Chicken.  The thin crust, with chunks of chicken, and topped with red onion and sweet/tangy BBQ sauce hits the spot.  

Not the greatest pizza ever, but its consistent, quality, and reliable.  Ill continue to patron this place over and over.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Damn...... the hype is real. BELIEVE THE HYPE! This place kicks ass. Pizza connoisseurs Chad A. and Dave G. even gave this place 5 stars! 

As others mention you walk in and choose a pizza you want off the board. You then add anything you want to it Chipotle style where you see the ingredients in front of you and the assembly line person custom makes your pizza. 

I had the #2 which is a meatball, sausage, and pepperoni pizza with mozzarella and pizza sauce. I added blue cheese, mushrooms, and garlic at no extra charge. I couldn't believe the mountain of toppings they put on top of the crust. I don't know if they're being generous to gain word of mouth or what... but man, so much food! My friend also ordered the #2 but added bell peppers, jalapenos, blue cheese, and olives.

These pizzas were done within minutes. The bottom of the crust was nice and crispy and the toppings were cooked perfectly. There were so many effen toppings on this thing I had to fold up the slice to eat it. Very tasty! I loved the blue cheese. They didn't over kill it so you just got a nice blast of flavor once in awhile. The meatball topping was ground up and tasted so good. I could barely finish my pizza(but did of course). This could easily feed two people. Even my friend suggested the idea we share one next time. 

The seating is a bit lame..... I guess they're trying to be hip and cool. Strange low to the ground couches, stools bolted to the floor, communal tables. Not really my thing but oh well, the food kicked ass.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OK,  finally tried this place with Maggie. 4 stars! It was delicious! The sausage tasted similar to Domino's Pizza though. The red sauce could use some seasoning, but overall this place was great! Can't beat the price and you can ask for as much toppings as you want? I'm definitely coming back! I'm so stuffed. Thank you Maggie for taking me here! It was pizza yummilicious!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is awesome! Basically a build your own pizza place and you can add as many toppings as you want and it's the same price! How awesome is that? I loaded my pizza with tons of toppings and topped it off with pesto sauce. One pizza is pretty big for one person but just do it and take the rest to go.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like pizza.  We ordered simple, just a couple of ingredients on each pizza.  One with sausage and pepperoni and another a Marguerite.  Nice crisp thin crust.  At $7.50/pizza, a pretty good deal, as they are about the size of a medium pizza at any other place.

You can put all you want of ingredients on your pizza.  The lady in front of me put everything.  Everything.  Not sure what that mess was going to taste like.  

You order as you come in.  At lunch time, it is a zoo.  Wait in line.  Tell them what  you want.  Pay.  They bring the food to your table, and pretty quickly, as they have one of those super-hot ovens.  

This is not a place for date night, as it is very casual, but it would be a good hang-out for a group.  Pretty high noise level.  

Big Complaint, however: How is it possible to have a pizza place and not have beer?  It just seems wrong to me.  Maybe take-out is the only way to go.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best pizza around! 
It's like a subway but for pizza!
A must try if you are in the area!
It's really close to cal state fullerton. About a 5 min walk.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pieology is delicious. I love that you can choose your own toppings. It's quick. And, because I have celiac disease, I greatly appreciate that they have gluten free options. More specifically, they have separate sauce and cooking boards so as to prevent cross contamination. My family and I went to Pieology last week and the manager wasn't impressed with how my gluten free pizza turned out; he said the edges were too burnt (it really wasn't bad at all). But, he insisted that he make me another pizza free of charge. He was beyond friendly and helpful, making sure that my pizza was again gluten free and up to his standards. Thanks, Daniel!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food and the prices are good but holy crap is the line SLOW! Plan on spending at least 25 mins plus in line. Fix that and I would rate 5 stars<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Still my favorite create your own pizza place!! What makes it even better is the fact that they have WHEAT CRUST PIZZA now!! There are also new toppings as well, not sure which ones though but they're stepping up their game big time especially since there have been new create your own pizza chains opening up. Real good move on them to add wheat crust, it really makes them stand out against the others and is a great healthy alternative :) ps. They also have a new 3 cheese Alfredo sauce, I haven't tried it yet but I can say I'm impressed on the new changes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow. A place where you can create your own pizza!  They have so many options that are out of this world, they make it in front of you, they're not too slow, and in the end, they have a completely satisfying taste and are even light enough for one person to finish a whole pie!  What more can you ask for?  If you love pizza and are looking for some place where you can create your own and mess around with experimental flavors, by all means check out this place!<p>
</p></p>
