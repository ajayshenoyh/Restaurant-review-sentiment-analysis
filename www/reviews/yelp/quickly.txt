<p itemprop="description">Came in today and was totally impressed by the service!  I used to frequent this location in high school, and today was my first time going since.  When I arrived, I was greeted by two friendly employees and ordered boba milk tea and fried popcorn chicken.  My food came out quickly, and the quality was top notch!  Delicious!  WOW!  The young asian male employee even reminded me to get a straw to drink my boba!!

10/10 would recommend.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Waited half an hour for my boba today. Quickly needs to hire more staff. The poor girl was making drinks and then helping a customer in between. It's way too much for one person.
I can't wait 30 minutes for a drink when I can just walk over to the two other boba spots and get my drink in a fraction of the time. 
I used to love Quickly but lately, it's just been too slow for my fast paced life.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always willing to try something different and in the mood for some teriyake chicken and chow mein, decided to try this location.

Worst idea.  Chicken was disgusting.  Chow mein tasteless.  As soon as I took a bite, my stomach twisted, literally.  My wife had the teriyake plate with rice and lettuce.  She had the same affect with the food, onl took two bites. The almod milk tea didn't make it better.  After only three bites, I was done.

Walked out, never to return.  Will stick to chipotle across the street next time.

Worst $30 I have spent.

Now I know why its called "quickly".... As soon as you see and taste food, you want to " quickly " leave...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great customer sevice tonight by the girl with orange hair ? Ordered popcorn chicken and wow the pieces were huge! I go to a lot of quicklys...this one by far the best with the chicken. 
Drinks are the same as other stores so the consistency is good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Way overpriced for college students. One milk tea boba is 3.50$, in garden grove I can get 2 milk tea boba LARGE for that price. Also shrimp fried rice and most plates are like 9$ or 10$. The straws aren't even sealed , they're unwrapped, for all I know they could just be washed and reused . Not coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here excited to try their boba and popcorn chicken. Sadly both were disappointing. My almond milk tea tasted like diabetes and my popcorn chicken had no flavor. I could forgive these as maybe having ordered the wrong things on the menu but there are better competitors in the area, why wouldn't you ensure better flavors to keep up? But I was more upset with the service to be honest.
I came to study for midterms and asked for the wifi, integral to the cafe. The lady behind the counter told me they had it but she had no idea what the network or password was. She literally shrugged at me and walked away! I thought that was pretty unprofessional as she made zero effort to resolve the situation. 
Simply put, not worth trying.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a nice and super clean location with great service.
I went with a blueberry slush and it was amazing!
Such great flavor and so refreshing on a hot day.
Prices are really fair and they have huge sizes available to hold you through for hours.
Drinks come out quickly and there is plenty of easy parking, worth the stop while in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First time and also last time. Here's why:
Service: super quick. I ordered, paid, and just about to sit down, they called my order.
I ordered popcorn chicken and honey milk tea with boba and grass jelly. 
Food: was okay. You know, not good but not bad. However, the total was $11.25 for freaking popcorn chicken and milk tea. I repeat $11.25. Never again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you read any of my reviews you'll know all my reviews are long but this one I'll make pretty QUICKLY.

I find it pretty ironic for a place that is named QUICKLY that it took 25 minutes to make my milk tea boba and popcorn chicken. Maybe they should think about renaming this place to slowly?

Did they have to go catch the chicken first? Just when I was about to cancel my order, my order is ready. The milk tea and popcorn chicken both tasted good but simply not worth the long wait.

Price:
A little pricer than your average boba spot. Also, a $.50 fee to use debit/credit if under $10.00

Tip:
Go somewhere else that will make your drink more QUICKLY. 

Location:
A shopping plaza surrounded by restaurants and several other businesses. Quickly is right between 99 cents store and Bank of America.

Experience:
First and last time for everything. Thanks but no Thanks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Got boba milk tea here. Pretty good, up to Quickly standards. Run by a polite older Asian man, soft-spoken, wished me a nice day. The orders here seem to take a little bit longer than most Quickly places, maybe cuz the only people working were the older guy and maybe one or two other people. Nice atmosphere.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Boba milk tea is yummy. Food...low quality home style. Service slow but friendly. Pretty mediocre.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here desperate for an afternoon boba tea after a rough day. I was quickly greeted by a friendly employee, and my milk tea was ready within a minute! I was so satisfied, and grateful for good customer service after a bad experience at the bank next door!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">How this backwards town yelp rates their local establishments - I will never know.
For the area this is THE PLACE to pick up a boba drink.

PROS:
Fairly priced, balanced and well made boba drinks, snacks, and Chinese take-out food.
I have ordered boba milk teas, iced coffees, flavored teas (hot - but not hot enough to burn your tongue! +++ & cold), smoothies, popcorn chicken, and some of their entrees (I don't recall which I have ordered). The staff is always very friendly and prompt to get an order started, sometimes there is a wait as they only staff one person through parts of the day, but its overall not an issue. Parking not bad, shared lot with other stores/bank.

Semi-CONS:
Personally, I think the interior design could be better if they used colors to accent the wood room divider (as it's very well made center piece of the room) - it could be a very attractive clean earthy and inviting space (as oppose to the stark blue, red, orange against the wood color scheme). I think they were going with a london or paris theme? I don't see the connection - but it may have been the result of a personal momento of particular meaning to the owner - who knows. 

Although the interior doesn't draw me in to stay - I will likely continue to be a faithful customer here as they really do have the best boba drinks here (personal favorite: hot passionfruit greentea w/ boba).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Haven't been here for years and decided to get a drink because I was next door at Bank of America. Their drinks and food menu still remains pretty big which took me some time to figure out what I want to order.

So I ordered the taro milk tea with boba, and after the first sip, I remembered why I stopped coming to this place. Their drinks are still hella sweet! After a few sips, I just stopped and waited till I get home so I can add ice to it. But aside from the sweetness, I do like their taro flavor and their boba has a nice chewy texture to it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quickly Chinese Cafe 
Chapman & State College in Fullerton

We went here for a boba 

Nice interior that looks more European than Chinese but is very warm and nice. 

Having one person working the whole place, I can't blame her for not fulfilling their name.  However after tasting, maybe they should change their name to yummy...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decent place for boba and a quick snack. Staff seemed friendly enough. However, their milk tea just doesn't live up to the expectations I had for it. Not bad, not great, just okay. I will give them a thumbs up for their popcorn chicken, though! Very tasty, just as other reviews have stated. I would get the 1/2 size though, because it's pretty filling and perfect for an on-the-go snack. Just under four dollars for it! This place is conveniently located across from my apartment complex, so I'll probably be back, but it will not be my #1 go-to place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Beef noodle soup. very yum. 
+milk tea with boba. yum
+fairly priced = will definitely come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's 11:43. Your website says open at 10:30. Your SIGN says open at 10:30. Your neon "open" sign is ON, and the door is locked! Disappointed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really want to give this place 5 stars because I love their Mapo tofu but their customer service is not what I would call great.  Maybe not even good.  A couple of times I have gone there to order my favorite Mapo tofu only to be told that the chef that cooks it was not there.  Mind you I wasn't arriving at a weird time.  I mean if around noon on a weekday is weird.

Today was the absolute worst though.  I had surgery in the morning and my wonderful husband headed out to get me some tofu only to wait for over 5 minutes for someone to even come to the order window.  They then told him that the person that cooks the tofu was not there and would be there at 5:00.  So around 5 he headed back to order my food.  Ordered it and paid for it and headed to the thai place a few doors down to order something for himself.  ( by the way this thai place we found out is super overpriced.  Head across the street to the place next to office depot.  yummy food and way cheaper).  He came back to pick up the food and they told him they didn't have the ingredients to make the dish he ordered.  

So lets see.  He went there around noon cook wasn't there.  Went back when they said the cook would be there.  Ordered and paid for food.  Went back to pick up food only to be told they didn't have the ingredients.  Needless to say he was pretty upset for having wasted so much time only to come home with nothing.

If they could pull their shit together this would be a half way decent place.  The number of times I have been there and ordered food successfully the staff has seemed like they would rather be somewhere else.  A little kindness and a smile goes a long way.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Taro Boba Milk Tea is the best! The staff also friendly. They have the customer punch card, every 10 purchased you can get 1 boba milk tea for FREE!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place makes authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food I crave from the SGV without the drive.

The lunch specials are awesome. I highly recommend the pork belly, the eggplant, and the orange chicken are BOMB.

Their drinks are huge for the price and the boba comes out perfectly. They have free wifi, which is convenient cause if you come during a rush, it can take a while for the food to come out. The workers are really really nice, though so I think it's because there's only a couple of them to make the food. Drinks come out super fast though.

Don't forget to use their stamp card!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went here last night 15 mins before they said they were closing. But when I got there, they were already closed. Maybe next time, you guys should change the hours on the sign because it's false advertisement.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Asian food overall so Taiwanese is no exception. We walked in the atmosphere was kinda slow but who cares. Food was awesome, bigass portion too! The owner and the server were both very nice toward us. Will come back with my gang for sure!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decent enough to do a quick boba run, but doesn't compare to any of the other places like in rowland heights, diamond bar, or garden grove.

But because their boba is still pretty good AND the fact that they are right next to csuf, I give it 4 stars :)

Food isn't bad...but I've had better. Love their popcorn chicken though.

Drink menu is very large. They have a lot to choose from.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't know why people bash on this place so much. It's a typical quick Taiwainese boba/food shop. You come here expecting the worst but this place isn't so bad. Thumbs up for their Interior being clean and spacious. Not sure if they have wifi, but it's a good study spot for sure. Their employee Josh or John (forgot then name, sorry) was super nice too. Although he messed up my order and forgot to add the spice for my popcorn chicken, it was fine because the portion of the popcorn chicken was big, and I have a huge appetite. It was not as plain as most people said it was, even with no spice. Sweet and sour sauce seemed watered down though. For my green tea with aloe vera and popcorn chicken, I paid about $9-10 but it was very filling. Would most likely come back again to try other foods. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually just go in for boba. They mess up my order more often than they get it right. They always seem in a rush, even when it isn't busy inside. If they slowed down and listened, I wouldn't have this problem.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">"Yum!" We thought, as we devoured shrimp chow mien, orange chicken and stir fried veggies. Friday night seemed to be a good night for Chinese. "This may be the best take out Chinese in Fullerton!"

WRONG. 

Fast forward through the miserable weekend to MONDAY night, as husband and I have been making trips to the restroom EVERY SINGLE HOUR -- no joke, we realize.... How wrong we were. 

If you want to sweat, growl, bubble and feel like absolute feces, by all means -- go eat here. Otherwise stay back. 

I am literally writing this from the bathroom.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not your regular Quickly that I'm used to. I'm used to Quickly being a boba cafe with light bites like popcorn chicken, calamari, etc. This location is a full on Chinese restaurant with a full menu including all the boba drinks and appetizers you would find at any boba joint. Their prices were a bit higher than other locations, so I only tried their popcorn chicken and milk tea with boba. Their milk tea tasted alright. Not consistent with other Quickly's milk teas that I've had, but not awful either. Their chicken was tasty and came out in a timely manner. I did like that they had a few appetizers that they offered a 1/2 portion of for $2.95.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best milk tea boba anywhere, and the large size is a great value for $3+ something. They also have the most honest staff. I accidentally left my wallet there on on 1/22, they called my AAA and Chase 800# to let them know I left it. There was cash in my wallet and it was left untouched. Thanks so much Quickly staff!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I come here regularly. Not sure about why there is bad reviews? They are always very nice and they have the best boba in town compared to other places in the nearby area and I've had a lot if Boba in my life around the USA. The popcorn chicken is great... Reminds me of Tapioca Express's. I've only ordered the food here once [broccoli beef] and it was excellent.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I used to come here a lot, and spoke with the owner when I would come in. However, this time coming here the employee that rang up my order was quite rude. I do not know if I will be coming here again after this..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the priciest quickly that I know of. Otherwise it tastes about what the rest of the locations that I have been to are like. It is also the only Quickly I have found in the OC. Granted I havent looked hard either.

I have had the popcorn chicken here a few times and I have also gotten both slushies and teas. The popcorn chicken is very good and tasty and includes the fried basil with the chicken as most other Quickly's provide. My coworkers have had a few of the other grub items here and everyone seems to enjoy what they have to offer. 

Pro Tip: You will get a $.50 convenience charge  to use your credit/debit card for an amount of $10 or less I believe. It may be $7.50, but i dont think so.

The boba is quite good and on the teas like lychee and mango you will find a lil bit of the fruit mixed in as well. That is always a great tasty surprise to me. Its in a giant parking lot and is also near a BofA (if you need an ATM for cash).

So hit it up if you need some boba in North OC cheaper than other places but not up to the standards of the SGV... it is OC afterall =\<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I should've turned around and left... I should've gone back into my car... I should've drove across the street to Guppy's or 85 Degrees then my tastebuds and stomach wouldn't have had to suffer tonight. 

I happened to be in the plaza already and I've been to a few Quickly's in the Bay Area so this place can't be too bad. Oh, how I was wrong. 

Nothing could've prepared me for the greasy onslaught of the Combination Chow Mein. I knew something was not quite right when the noodles kept slipping off the tines of my fork. Just a slimy, oily mess. Tasted like noodles dunked in canola oil. 

As for my Rose Black Tea, it was oddly a bright orange color.  I have a feeling it was a concoction of brewed tea and Tampico. 

The kitchen being walled off is a little suspicious. The only openings were the order and pick-up window. Do you have something to hide back there?

Nope. Never coming here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Man,  I don't know what but every time I eat their orange chicken, it is sick to my stomach.  I just had orange chicken today because I basically forgot that this will give me stomach ache.  It did.....
Are they using old oil to cook the chicken or what?.
Will not come back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love going to new places to try different milk teas with boba. This review is strictly on the drinks we ordered because I did not try the food. However, the drinks were not good.

We ordered a coconut milk tea and almond milk tea with boba. These are two standard flavors that should always be yummy. For starters the drinks did not have enough ice. From the very first sip it was warm and had little ice in it once we got it in our hands. They did not taste sweet or even have a stronger tea flavor but tasted like water. The boba was soft but did not have a sweet flavor like others I've had. 

Maybe it was an off day for them but I do not see myself coming back. From what I saw the food looked good but it's like fast food so not sure how fresh it will be.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Only place that I like getting boba.  The boba here is perfectly soft.  Other places, its dense as a rock.  I like how they still rocking the stamp card.  Buy 10 drinks and get the next one on the house.

I like getting the popcorn chicken here.  Extra spicy please!  

To the owners:  BOBA IS GREAT!  DONT CHANGE ON HOW YOU MAKE IT!  THIS IS THE REASON IM A REPEAT CUSTOMER!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Drinks: A bit pricey. Their boba is not cooked. Its hard in the center and crunchy! GROSS! I am a huge boba fan and am disappointed in their boba. Also their tea drinks are way too sweet and you cannot even taste the tea. Their slushes is too thick. 

Food: Popcorn chicken size and price is a rip off. Garlic fries did not taste like garlic at all. The only good thing on the menu is the eggplant dish. 

Service: Way too slow! The girl was just taking her time when there was a line. I ordered a to go order for drinks and they said you can only order to go for food. Like really common you guys take forever!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to most Quickly's and every one of them are the same to me. No big surprise especially living in Alhambra/Monterey park.. Boba's in every corner. A couple weeks ago after Ramen, my boyfriend and i decided we want some boba so we came to Quicklys I ordered the Peppermint milk tea it came out too sweet so we had them adjust it. Not knowing what they'll do but they gave me back my drink and it was just awful! I am lactose, but I can have a little of milk but this adjustment was straight milk and it was gross so i send it back. After the taste of milk I don't even want my drink anymore. Stick with the easy stuff like Almond milk tea and/or Milk tea with boba.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Coffee jelly milk tea is the best! They also have delicious popcorn chicken too, but I wish they would have a better version of sweet and sour sauce.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review is for the iced lychee yogurt drink and garlic fries. The drink was pretty alright - there were very tiny lychee pieces inside which made me happy. But the garlic fries were way too salty and I didn't taste any garlic at all.

Watch out for the $7 minimum credit card charge. Also, make sure the cashier reads back your order to you because she kept getting mine wrong.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I asked if they had honey Green Milk Tea drink and the cashier man (seems to be the owner) says yes and what came out wasn't what I ordered. I mentioned to him that he made me the wrong drink but he says it's just Honey Tea since honey and milk tea doesn't mix together..... Wth ....i should've just went to another establishment.

And I would be less annoyed if my accidental drink was good, but it was horrible!! Do not order honey tea. It taste literary like plain sugar water. 

And he did not offer to fix my drink even though I was obviously unhappy. 

I will not bother to come here ever again..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is only a drink review. Their thai tea was excellent and the boba was perfect. There was no one in the restaurant so we got the drinks super fast. The passion fruit tea with boba was really tasty as well.

Refreshing and just what we needed.

The staff wasn't too friendly but I applaud them on their boba skills!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just had a fried chicken steak lunch platter and it was terrible.  Before I ordered the platter, I asked if the steak was made of white meat. I was told yes, but what I got was a soggy piece of fried dark meat chicken. 

The lunch platter came with fried chicken, corn, an egg, and cabbage kimchi. As I have said before, the chicken was very very soggy soaked woth grease. It was just gross. I had two small pieces, and ended throwing it away. What ever you get here, do not get what I got. Disgusting.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review is for their spicy beef noodle , it's the worst beef noodle ever ! The meat taste like rock , you cant even tell us the beef or it's the pork , the soup is way too sweet , the veggies is not fresh , has a wired taste , definitely not a good choice , don't waste your money on it !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Terrible service. We arrived when they opened and the guy at the counter would not accept a food order from us. He said the litchen wasnt open yet even though they literally had food on the counter for a large party they catered for. They obviously dont have their sh!t together if they cant even sell food when they are open. Ive never heard of a restaurant that would not accept my food order when they were open. They must not like making money.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is definitely better than most Chinese food places around here. The orange chicken and fried rice were delicious. Also the service was great. The cashier/server boy was super sweet and made sure we had everything we needed and I really appreciated that. The cream cheese wontons are not the worst but not the best. The boba drink was really delicious but the boba itself was a bit strange. Some pieces were too hard, some were too soft. That wouldn't affect my review though since this is a Chinese food place not a boba place. Also they don't have soda unless you want to buy it as a can. I bought a soda from Subway instead since I drink quite a bit of soda. Other than that, I would definitely go here again and would recommend it to you if you're in the area. Definitely better than Pick-Up-Stix. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Orange chicken is great, so is the chicken fried rice. Boba is hit and miss, but the drink itself tasted good. They only have sodas that come in a can, so if you want refills I'd recommend going to subway next door and buying a drink there. This place is better than most chinese food places out there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Haven't had the chance to stop by here for boba tea for a very long time but as I was in the area, and hungry, my friend and I stopped by for a quick meal of hot noodle soup.  I ordered the combo noodle soup with shrimp, chicken and no beef and half salt.  The guy at the window was helpful and guided me to my final selection.  It was awesome and had a mild spiciness that was just right.  The vegetables and chicken were bite size pieces which are easier to eat and much better than other places where the chunks of vegetables almost need a knife and fork.  Nice and clean interior that doesn't feel claustrophobic.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Come here from time to time. They have a huge selection of drinks. I try to get something new everytime i come here. I have tried their food as well. 
The spicy beef noodle soup was full of flavor and tasted very fresh. The beef was tender and the veggies were fresh. The broth had a great taste to it. But what it did lack was the SPICY! Sadness for the non-spicy factor. Yes i know i can put hot sauce on it but thats not the same.

Overall the best thing food wise would be the orange chicken. I get it to go and the wait time is overall is not bad.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quickly is definitely my go to place in Fullerton to get to go boba drinks.

As far as the slushes go, I alternate between strawberry yogurt (yum! ) or taro slush. Both with boba.

Slushes here are smooth, soft, and very blended. Hardly any ice fragments, and the fruit here is always blended  finely (so no fruit chunks). 

The taro is sweet, and is a little above standard of what a taro slush needs to taste like. 

The strawberry yogurt is VERY creamy, great flavor, and is one of the best slushes I have ever had. 

Boba is the right kind of chewy, good sized, and never clumped together.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My sisters and I just came here for drinks and are really pleased. They are a reasonable price for $3.85 and the regular sized cup is bigger then other places. The young lady was really nice and the decor is so cute! Definitely will come again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has ripped me off so many times before. They are so cheap with their popcorn chicken sauces too! 

They charge for sauce, and when I got mine, the sauce container was sticky and had sauce all over it. When I ate the popcorn chicken, it was mostly just crumbs on the bottom and fat inside the big pieces.

Also, their tea and slush quality is below average. Teas are way too dark and strong (sometimes bitter), and slushes taste like ice. I am a boba addict, but their boba tastes days old.

I really wish there was a decent boba place in Brea/Fullerton...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">THEIR DRINKS ARE SO NASTY... First of all I ordered jasmine milk tea and strawberry yogurt.. Ok so we thought the strawberry yogurt obviously had yogurt in it right ? Nope. It's just syrup so we asked for the strawberry milk smoothie and when we got it, it was TOO SWEET LIKE SUGAR WATER. And my jasmine milk tea .. TASTED LIKE SUGAR WATER TOO. 
The girl that took my order was nice but the this other girl .. Wow she was rude. She walked away from my friend when she was trying to talk to her. Like ok are you serious? 
We asked for a refund for the strawberry milk because my friend didn't drink it so we did get a refund. The manager or the boss asked if anything was wrong and ofc we told him that it was sweet and the girl was being rude. So he brought her to the front and while he was talking she walked away from him.. so rude that's your own boss sweetie. 
One star because they re-made our drinks and one more star because at least we got a refund.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This was just a terrible experience. My first and last one with this chain. The drinks took forever to come out (after the food even), and the food wasn't very "quick" either.

When we did finally get out drinks, my milk tea still had chunks of sugar and the drink was just not mixed very well altogether. When I mentioned it, they remade it and the second drink was no different. And they refused to give a refund for a drink they failed to make twice now. 

The food was average, nothing too special you couldn't get at another Chinese place, but a bit pricier than most. Definitely would not recommend<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered a Strawberry Yogurt fruit drink with Boba.  I was disappointed because it tasted like strawberry juice only.  That being said it was over priced for just a cup of juice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Taiwanese food, but this place is so overpriced. It's located right near CSUF and obviously targeting students, yet their prices aren't student friendly for what it's worth. 

Their milk tea is A-OK, but I still prefer Lollicup's milk tea. I like how it's more milky than having that strong tea taste. Their chicken fried steak doesn't look like it's been breaded at all and at $8.65.. I don't think it's a good deal. They have a 3 entree for $20 deal, but it doesn't state that it's only valid on certain entrees on their menu(mostly Chinese options). I go here since it's the closest to my work and it satisfies my milk tea cravings. They only have a large and extra large size option.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Under new management, this Quickly has blossomed, though it's still not quite as up to par as it could be.  The service is good, with friendly and efficient staff, and there's usually plenty of parking, even if you have to walk a little.  Nothing wrong with that - you can burn off the milk tea calories on your way back to the car if you parked far enough away!

The menu is a lot nicer looking too, and it looks as though there are enough food options to have a meal here, though I haven't done that yet.  This review is pretty much for the drinks.

Lavender milk tea - perfect amount of sweetness, but the tea overpowered pretty much the entire drink, and I could not quite finish it.

Watermelon juice - great watermelon flavor, but very, very sweet.  I'll ask for less sugar next time.

Honeydew milk tea - tasty, but again, a bit too sweet.

Otherwise, the place is clean, and nearby, and given the shortage of tea houses in Fullerton, I'll give them another chance soon :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I decided to look for a Quickly nearby and found this location in Fullerton.  I ordered several dishes and a boba milk tea.  I was so disappointed after I took a sip off milk tea.  The drink was watered down and this is after I asked for easy ice.  I thought, maybe the food (minced meat on rice) was going to compensate for the the drink, but to my dismay, the food was so awful! I have never had this dish taste this bad.  The meat had pieces of fat and hardly had any mushroom.  They charged for .50 extra to get it with a boiled egg, which I have never had this dish without the hard boiled egg.  The meal was bland!  I also purchased some fried rice but I am afraid that it may be a disappointment as well.  
I will not be going back to this location again.  I only decided to try this place because it was near my house.  I do not recommend this place.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in because I was craving popcorn chicken and milk tea. The man who helped me was very nice. My milk tea was delicious. My popcorn chicken was mediocre. Some of the pieces were way too large and had the taste and texture of the low-quality chicken some Chinese places use. I asked for a medium level of spiciness and I don't think what I was given had any spice to it at all. I asked for more and he handed me the shaker and I added some spice and that helped a LOT! I had sweet and sour sauce on the side and it was fresh out of the refrigerator. Freezing cold! I got used to having ranch with my popcorn chicken at Tastea, so I was a little sad they didn't have ranch here. Yes, I'm THAT white... :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good boba and good orange chicken entree for around $8. The boba comes in various sizes and they even have an XL option if it can fit in your cup holder. They have a wide selection of milk teas and slushes and are conveniently located in the Big Lots Plaza although they're a lot closer to the 99 Cents Store and Bank of America. Don't forget to ask for a stamp card to get a free drink after you've bought ten!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came in at 9 to get food. They close at 10, and their "chef" had already gone home. Wtf. Poor business practice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You only come here for the milk tea or other beverages. If you're coming here for their food then you're doing it wrong no sane person comes to a tea house to buy their entrees just like no one goes to a Mexican restaurant for their sushi.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">BOBA - I really liked their boba and they have two sizes, which is good if you're REALLY craving one. I've tried the green apple tea, and the lemon tea with boba. The lemon tastes like candy, which kind of turned me off to it. The apple green tea was great. The have a ton of extra add-ons, like aloe jelly, and red beans. Been here twice already.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love the milk teas and the prices! And the different boba and jellies ;P
The super cup is great for sharing and so is the popcorn chicken snack :)

The staff is friendly and the wait isn't long. I've yet to have a bad experience at Quickly's. I like to stop by here for a sweet treat after eating at Pho Olivia ;)

I recommend the strawberry, honeydew, and taro milk teas! :D<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I tolerated this place because it had decent portions for popcorn chicken, but now I will not be coming back because they raised their price AND reduced their portions. Their garlic fries were about 4 dollars and just tasted like plain fries. Also, all of their food prices were covered with tape. I seriously would not recommend this place and will not be coming back. They charge for small containers of ketchup for god's sake.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would give 0 stars if I could.  I called 20 min before they close and hey refused to help me.  Not cool<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went here craving Chinese. This was my first time here and I took a risk as this is not the typical chinese joint where you can see the food before you order. At least at those places if it looks old you don't order it. If you're looking for typical chinese (half and half orange chicken beef broccoli combo type of place this place is not it. they told me they don't do that. so I went for the Teriyaki chicken with rice and veggies box. and thai tea came out to like $12 bucks! the chicken was super dry for sure it was not fresh maybe day old chicken. The teriyaki was not sweet. overall it was really dry and salty. the side of veggies was overcooked cabagge. and corn and peas. I did not care for this meal one bit. I totally regret coming here wish I would have gone to subway next door! overpriced stale yucky. the Thai tea was fine. a little too sweet for my taste but OK. If I ever go back it will not be for the food that's for sure.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place used to be my favorite for dinner, but not anymore.

Prices went UP and quality went DOWN.

The container they serve the mapo tofu in is a horrible joke.... Granted the older man behind the counter warned me to keep it flat, after literally 4 turns it still leaked all over the bag and some into my car rendering the napkins and chopsticks useless and me furious.

The counter is walled off as if they are hiding something....it never used to be like that and makes the whole experience very awkward.

All being said, the mapo tofu was still tasty and good but I'm sorry to say I'll never be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was highly disappointed with this place. Right from the beginning the young lady did not understand my order then she told me they did not have the Chinese food until 4:00 pm. I said I will wait the 15 minutes and she said not is until 5:00pm. They seemed to be overwhelmed with the work even though the place was nearly empty. The patrons that were here seemed to be annoyed and now I understand why. The chicken was super dry and had no flavor. The popcorn chicken tasted like it had been sitting there for a minute. Overall bad experience. I will continue to go to the one in Covina. This is the first time I am disappointed with this company. $47 total for inferior food and dry chicken.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So. Slow. Seriously??????? And the tables were dirty. Gross. I only come here for convenience but get disappointed while waiting and having to see how dirty the place is. Gotta remember next time to just drive across the street!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">2 stars for milk green tea and for the nice owner who made our drinks on our first visit. 

On our second visit, the owner was not there... so.. 

This worker kid was moody or something because he refused to make our drink hot (even though on the sign it says make any drink hot with no extra charge). 

I would come here if I dont feel like driving far for an asian drink. But dont get anything else.

DO NOT GET FOOD HERE. It's terrible. We got chow mein. YUCK. 
And we got orange chicken YUCK.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ive only had Quicklys milk teas & they are excellent! My favorite is the hot almond milk tea! Ive tried there coconut milk tea also & both were delicious. The only thing I don't like is they have different staff every time I go so for some reason I have to explain to them how I want my tea extra hot so its not cold by the time I drive out the parking lot. Some of them get it, some of the don't, some of them will have to make my drink over again! ALSO NO BOBA, MEANS NO BOBA! I never order boba with hot tea, I make that clear at time of order but they seem to forget & therefore Im pissy because lack of them paying attention to the customer results into waiting for them to remake my drink. UGH!!! Just pay attention, not that complicated, its only a drink! Nevertheless the dam drinks are good when they are made right; so Ill always go back if I'm in the area :-/<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Has a minimum of 7 dollars to use your debit card. They refused service. Even when I said I'll pay the 2%visa transaction fee. Hope management gets a chance to review this. This is unlawful in the state of California. I won't got as far as saying it violates my civil rights but it you can understand where this could lead if you continue to reject modern age debit card use.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Spicy tofu is super good and their super sized drinkd are enormous. Pretty cheap too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They take forever to make and theur boba isnt good. The food isnt good either. It looks good on pictures but when you eat it...... Especoally thwir beef noodle soup an popcorn cchicken.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place was an OK place to get boba before 85 degrees opened up. I've only come here a few times for their boba, not their food. The boba was OK, not the best but it'll do if there's no other places around. It does take some time to get your boba, funny cuz the place is called quickly. Better to have cash because they have like a $5 dollar limit if you wanna see your credit card.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Please don't waste your time coming in here....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sunday 3/8/12 5pm

Been waiting for my order for more then 10 minutes! Poor customer service. First one to Order out of 3 people and I'm the last one to finally get my drink. Not coming to this place again & I don't recommend it to anybody else.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Being from the 626, I'm often very deprived of boba and cafes when I'm at CSUF. This is as close to my boba cravings as I can get, unfortunately. The prices here are so much higher than at home. About $4 a drink for the regular. They have those Half & Half fat cups here for another $1 upgrade. This Quickly is located on the plaza corner of Chapman and State College. It is completely walkable from the CSUF campus. Not the best, but seems to be the only decent boba shop around.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First of all, THE PLACE IS UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP

Food quality has improved significantly.  I had the noodle soup and enjoyed it very much.  The drinks are great too!  The boba is perfunctory fanfare for most; but they also have a wide assortment of jellies and fruit!

I love coming here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wow! This is the only Quickly that is sub-par.  I've been a Quickly fan ever since they started a long time ago.  

I go to this Fullerton location because its near a family home.  I also go the one in Rolling Heights.

In January I stop by this place for a lot of food to go for the family to eat on the way home.  Bought some boba drinks, fried pork chop on rice, popcorn chicken, fried rice and a few other items.  IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT!  The fried pork chop on rice was SMALL, DRY and lack true flavor you would get for this dish.  Popcorn chicken used to be always good and plenty, this time was a bunch of crumbs, they were dry and lack consistency in the spicy flavor.  Its like they just added the spice poorly at the end.  The  fried rice was a joke.  The boba is the only thing that tasted good after spending $30.  What a let down.  

Stopped by there again last Sunday and ordered 2 popcorn chicken, thinking it was just bad luck last time because this place has never let me down before.  The price went up 25% from $3.99 to $4.99 just for an order of popcorn chicken.  So I ordered 1 mild and 1 spicy.  Waited over 10 minutes and I had to go ask what's taking so long.  The guy said "oh its been done".  Then I see the 2 trays of popcorn chicken sitting on the table.  The same 2 trays I saw about 3-5 minutes earlier and thought it was someone else's order.  They've been sitting there?  He put them in a bag and handed it to me.  I said wow the price has gone up and the portion didn't.  He didn't say anything.  

I asked him if this Quickly changed ownership.  He said yes but its been a few months.  So I told him "I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE".

Got in my car and we started to eat the popcorn chicken, they are DRY!  AGAIN! with LOTS OF CRUMBS and SMALL PIECES!  Not like before when you would get plenty of tender larger chunks.

We are so disappointed.  Looks like the new owner(s) really DO NOT know what they are doing and could be cutting corners.  We will be visiting the Rolling Heights Quickly more often instead.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I haven't tried the food here. I am simply reviewing their drinks only. We love coming here for their bobas never disappointed and love the fact that they have a super size. Highly recommend their peach or mango black or green tea with lychee jelly or any of their drinks. I usually get atleast two drinks so don't forget to ask for a stamp card i believe u get your 10th or 11th drink free. Friendly customer service too!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I come here if I don't want to drive far for boba. I either get thai milk tea or just regular milk tea. Both of them are pretty good for the price/size. The popcorn chicken here is wayyy better compared to guppys.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Got the milk tea boba was really good for $3.18 size large, Going to try the food next time cause the menu looks really good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decent place to get boba, freshness of boba is 40% good / 60% bad at times. It is nice that there's another Taiwanese style boba house in the area but I would prefer Guppy's up Chapman more. I will say you won't get a busy crowd at Quickly's though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I wanna grab my drink and leave as quickly as possible.

Nasty popcorn chicken , I suspect it's been deep fried and just reheated. Tasted as if it's been out for days. I took one bite and threw the pack away .... sucks too, around  4 ish? man i want my money back.

Ice milk drink with coffee jelly
- It wasn't bad. Using the drinks at Half and Half  as a base to compare,  I think the coffee jelly was a tad hard.
- honey boba isn't good 
- on the sweeter side than what I'm use too

Overall
- I wanna say $3.60 ish for the small size drink ( about 16 oz )
- popcorn chicken should be avoided 
- 2 stars instead of 3 because I saw the lady cough around my cup as she made my drink<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOBA PLACES OF ALL TIME!!! I go here at least three times a week, and have tried almost all of their milk teas. They really are amazing! You can't go wrong with any selection! Also, the staff is extremely friendly. You always feel welcomes. Make sure to get a stamp card too, because you will be able to get your 10th boba free!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I live in the area and frequently visit Quickly their prices are decent for a big portion of food. Their chow mein is recommended. Their teas and slushies are soo good as well. Service is always good. Only bad part is the main chef sometimes leaves early leaving them with only certain items on the menu.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My favorite drink with boba has always been thai tea, but the thai there I don't really much prefer because it's sweet and not milky and I prefer it very teaish, a little sweet, and milky. So my alternative choice there is the milk tea. So far it's been my favorite milk tea I have tried because it's very milky. The boba served there are hug sizes which I like.  The service is a little slow even though the name of the place is called quickly.  They give you numbers which they call for  your order to be picked up. I haven't tired the food there, but maybe if I have a half day I'll come by forsure. I've tried the popcorn chicken there and I very much like it. Overall  it's a good place to pick get boba at.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered almond milktea and taro milktea. Both tasted terrible. Plus they give me stomachache too! Should have saved my $9 and go somewhere else. -.-<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This quicklys has one of the most pricy drinks compared to the other quicklys I've been to. The time to make a single slushy takes them about 20 minutes to make, which is pretty ironic. The flavor of the drinks are fine, although some might be too sweet. I will only recommend this place if you're really thirsty and there isn't a boba place for another 10 miles.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Read the reviews and went anyway. Lady at the counter messed up my order! The previous eviews were accurate. I want to add that I was the ONLY customer there and she hands me a number to wait...really! I complained to her and she really did not seem concerned. Also to the man there (owner?) and got a "sorry" only. I won't be back. Simple order should have been taken accurately.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I got out of a three hour class and was seriously low on sugar.  Needed a quick picker upper and found Quickly in the same plaza as the 99 cent only / subway / bank of america / goodwill plaza on Chapman.  From first glance, it looks like they've just opened up because a bright yellow banner stating thai milk tea special waves confidently above their store sign.  

Despite the wide variety of boba drinks - I've only tried their boba milk tea because for one, the tea is delicious. Not too weak not too strong - just right.  Two, the boba is a mix - seriously a mix! One time I got these rectangular ones mixed with squares ones mixed with round boba and mini boba! It was hilarious to eat!  And three - seriously for 2.75 + tax you get a great regular size boba drink that's the equivalent of a large boba milk tea from lollicup.  I say what a steal!!! 

I've gone here at least 10 times but always forgot to do the punch card thing.  Note** Get the punch cards - buy 10 get one free is totally worthwhile.  Not sure about the food... I really only want to grab a boba drink and 'quickly' get out of there. From the minute you order and pay for your drink - boba is at the pickup window in less than 2 minutes - sometimes even more 'quickly' ;]<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service is sooooo slow! How long does it take to make 2 milk teas? It's been close to 20 min. Is there any way to give them negative stars????<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was ordering my food and drink to go because my friend and I were in a rush to a meeting. We weren't expecting the service to be speedy quick because we understand food preparation does take a while. However, they got our order entirely wrong. They didn't notify to substitute my friend's aloe vera with something else, my drink was supposed to be a hot tea and not cold tea and the whole point of me ordering the drink was to help soothe my throat. We ended up just taking our order and leaving right away despite all the errors.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Came here around 8:30pm, was really craving boba and they ran out. What boba place runs out of boba?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I remember when the boba craze was in full swing, and boba joints were popping up left and right.  Within the one to two block radius of the Chapman/State College intersection, there were three separate boba places.  Now Quickly seems to be the last man standing in that particular area.

My boyfriend and I usually go to Quickly for Almond Milk Teas with boba, which we love. A word of caution: they're extremely sweet, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into. I love them, though, because they taste almost like cherry. Mmmm...delicious, and so filling!

Typically if we order food, we call it in for pick-up. We actually went there for a sit-down lunch the other day, and it was decently busy. Being that CSUF was on spring break at the time, I'm sure it was actually somewhat of a "slow" day for them. We got our entire order in about 10 minutes.

Their popcorn chicken is pretty good, but doesn't come with a dipping sauce. Boo. I love fried tofu, but would skip it here because it's hard to eat and is a little bland. They use the silken variety, so it falls apart pretty easily when eating with chopsticks (or the little wooden skewers they provide). Maybe stepping it up to a medium firmness would fix that issue. The tofu is also without sauce.  :(

I guess Quickly's "claim to fame" is their orange chicken, which is lightly breaded and totally scrumptious. After hearing so many Yelpers rave about it, we decided to try it. I'm not a huge orange chicken fan, but I liked it, and my boyfriend was head over heels for the stuff. We shared it the first time, but when he had a full order to himself, he did note that it was hard to finish because it became "too sweet" about halfway through the meal. I enjoyed their Ma Po tofu, but it would be nice with a little ground pork on it. Their kung pao chicken was also tasty, but nothing to write home about.

Be forewarned: they asked how spicy we wanted our food, and we ordered our popcorn chicken and fried tofu 'medium'. By the end of the meal our noses were running like crazy. Thank God I had the milk tea, because my mouth and lips were on fire!

On a final note, the portions here are a bit overpriced and small compared to other Chinese places I frequent, so I probably won't make it a point to return for food. Since it's the closest boba place to me, I think I'll stick with the drinks only. If you're interested in quality Taiwanese food for a fraction of the price, you might as well venture over to Rowland Heights. It's a mecca over there.  ;)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">IN with the new, OUT with the old!! 

The store is totally remodeled and is under new-management. With that, more better drinks &  food (but I honestly don't recommend the food. On the pricey end & a bit salty for my taste). 

Don't be a boring person and get the usual "milk-tea," try the CARAMEL milk tea instead! Has more flavor and is sweet :)

I love that they have a stamp card too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My friend from the bay area wanted Quickly and so we came to this location.  Personally, I had never heard of Quickly.  When we got there, the place was completely empty.  The service was okay and the avocado shake I ordered was pretty good.  We also had popcorn chicken, which was okay (very similar to Guppy House).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's a pretty hidden Quicklys, compared to the one in Rowland Heights. It's a bit of the same layout, but this one is pretty deserted and less bright. Maybe it's the lack of lights and bright accents, or that the location is pretty bad and the staff is usually the woman who works at a marathon pace. It feels like she only wants your money and wants you gone from the site.

The milk tea was pretty cheap when they first started, but then it got expensive, but then there was the super cup deal, which I always get. I know my mother hates this place, because they used to literally scoop the milk tea out of this large metal pot that was on the floor from like a water container, the asian kind, if you know what I mean. She always said she'd call the health inspectors and tell them how unsanitary it was, but she never did. I like how its not too milked down, and how you can taste the tea. Although sometimes, I do feel like my stomach is battling with the boba, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels like this. 

Their menu is quite large. Sometimes, when I don't feel like getting the usual super cup deal, I'll look up and read it and get lost, and then decide why complicate my life since I can't read Chinese, and just go with the super cup. I really think they should minimize and put an english version of their menu out, considering that they aren't in a full asian community, and most of the students around fullerton aren't all asian. 

It's an alright place if you just want to get your boba fix for under $5. Coming from Irvine, and how the closest boba is Cha for Tea, this is actually quite cheaper, and you can taste the tea, instead of the sugar. But if you're looking for taste and quality, I suggest taking a boba adventure.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">According to other viewers, this Quckly location has undergone new management. I visited this location with my boyfriend to try their drinks. I honestly wasn't expecting much because I've read old reviews about this location, but when I got my almond milk tea (with no boba) for $3, in what seems to be a 24oz cup, I was really surprised. Some of their drinks can be really sweet...I had their iced milk drink with caramel, honey boba, and pudding (which tastes exactly like Rowland Height's Meow Meow version) and felt that it was a little too sweet for my liking. 

The only food items I've had is the fried tofu snack, and their eggplant entree that comes with a side of rice. Both I feel are really good :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Terrible customer service at this quicklys location. The person who helped us would not allow us to make our drink sweeter. He said it was not possible. Then he decided it was ok for a $1 more. Ok, whatever, extra charge. When the drink finally came out the person gave us the wrong drink. We told him and he said nothing to us and went and told them to remake it. After this, he told us that it was going to cost us even more. They messed up our order and did not even offer an apology. We waited and finally got the order it was horrible.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have not eaten out Chinese in a while.  It was good to get my hands on something tender and delicious today.

Being a young Mexican-American dude without a broad range of authentic Chinese cuisine knowledge my review will serve a different purpose, for the common eater, the average joe.

I had the chicken fried rice and a coke to go, my co-workers brought the food back to the office.  The chicken fried rice was enjoyable to me as the rice tasted moist, soft and thick.  There was not too much chicken which was ok, good amount of egg, could use some more green onion.  Anyhow, I just finished eating the styrafoam tray of rice.

The coke to go was a can of soda with a boba cup and boba straw.  I finished my meal and took a pic of my chopsticks.

With a location near Fullerton College & Cal State Fullerton I can imagine this place stays busy.  I will need to try thier other menu items before deciding to rate this place a 3 or 4 but for now I will say 4.

PS:  I hear good things about thier boba and ice tea, but did not try it.  I do not typically drink boba unless I am eating out with an asian female and she forces me to.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Got the broccoli shrimp and my boyfriend got the orange chicken. We shared the veggie chow mein. YUM! We had been looking for a quick but good Chinese place and this definitely satisfied us!  We will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love their jasmine green tea with boboa!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review is for the boba solely. 
$1.50 milk tea with boba!!! Cannot beat it. I like the milk tea here. Tried other drinks and they were good also. 
Had the papaya milk shake but somehow it tasted so much like coconut?!?!? Wonder if they took the wrong order but I saw some pieces of papaya in it?!?! It was good so I kept it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I bought ice almond milk tea here and almost threw up. Inside everything looks ok, a bit dirty but acceptable. Service was like in any other fast food restaurant. But the drink...Terrible aftertaste and feeling that milk powder stuck to my throat. It was NOT a boba tea. It was disgusting. NEVER AGAIN!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Boba milk tea and fried tofu for snack.  Those are the only two items that we buy for our niece.  Have yet to try anything else.  My niece loves the fried tofu, but I am not too crazy about it.  The boba milk tea was okay.

The restaurant itself was clean, and the staff was kind.  There were a few people hanging out using their laptops and drinking tea.  Maybe they have wi-fi?  I noticed that everything on their menu from food to drinks were all under $10 so the prices appear reasonable.

They are worth checking out and giving your opinion on.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Meh. Drinks are ok. Food is BLEH. AND my friend found a long strand of hair in her food. Probably not coming back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What you'd find out "Quickly," about this place is how quickly they can disappoint you. I came in one day and ordered a simple honey green tea with no boba or anything inside it. It took me 25 minutes to get my drink. Everybody behind me was getting their drinks, and when I walked up to the window it turns out the girl forgot to give the staff my ticket so she completely forgot about me. 

Every time I come in it takes forever to get my drink. There is maybe two people in the kitchen to make food and drinks if you are lucky, but they don't have a system down at all. It's all done in order by ticket so I think if you just ordered a water cup you'd still have to wait 15 minutes just to get it. You'd think they'd know how to juggle drink making and food but they are really slow about doing everything. 

Yes it's under new ownership which seems to draw in more college kids than it did before, but this place was terrible on service before and still terrible now. They seriously need to hire more people that know how to manage orders.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Its not BAD but its not good by any means. I mean I was craving milk tea boba and I feel like they met me half way...by giving me milk tea boba. 

Good milk tea boba? No. 
Bad milk tea boba. No. 
Milk tea boba that fills me with happiness and joy? Well still no. 

I just kind of drank it and that was the end of that. No opinion.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great tasting milk tea boba, which is priced well, but they definitely over-charge for everything else. The orange chicken is very good, but they hardly give any rice and if you ask for chow mein, they will charge another $2.50 to $3 because they make it when you order it...and they will add it to the $6.99 they already charge for the combo of an item like orange chicken and very little white rice. I would definitely return for the boba though :) 

Also, bring cash or there's a $7 minimum to use your debit card.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We get chow mein noodles maybe every month or two.  Normally the noodles are fresh and tasty and the shrimp is grilled and so delicious. Today the noodles were soggy and clumped together the shrimp was like they took old shrimp and fried them. Gave me a stomach ache. Not happy especially since they are normal fresh and delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Terrible drinks and horrible service! 

I came here with a party of eight. We ordered a variety of drinks including boba milk tea, almond milk tea, strawberry slush, lychee slush, and honey green tea. We all hated our drinks! They were bad tasting, sickly sweet, and artificial. They were extremely sugary even though we asked for "very little sugar." Everyone passed their drinks around and gagged. My friend said their drinks "literally tastes like cleaning products." 

Service was extremely rude. When we were ordering, the old lady worker said loudly that we "always cause trouble." My friend politely asked for additional ice in his drink because it was too sweet, and the workers started defending themselves and arguing with one another. Worst customer service I have ever encountered!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you don't already know, I'm on this sick obsessive boba craze. I don't know what the heck is wrong with me. The second I walked out of Starbucks all I could think about was getting my hands on a nice cold black tea with boba. That's when I whipped out the all amazing Yelp and looked for the closest boba place and Quickly is what it gave me. It's located inside a plaza next door to Subway which just so happened to be more busy than Quickly.

Now I can't vouch for their food and I gaurantee they aren't 5 star quality but I do know they are Chinese so they should know a thing or two about cooking up some decent Chinese food. The lady was super nice it was like talking to my aunt back at home. The black tea totally hit the spot. It quenched my thirst for some good tea. Boba consistency was right on. This place is very spacious but the table I was sitting at was kind of sticky. Regardless, I will most definitely come back when I'm in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i noticed that most of the 4 & 5 stars  are given by the Laowai: non asian folks. LOL.What the hell do you know about drinking teas.

I arrived and to my amazement [S]He-Man w/ glasses greeted me in a heavy mandarin accent 
" What do you want!" 
I reply, " give me a thai tea," and 
[S]He-Man let out a howl and slowly said "god loves me."
"What?" I replied.
Handed me the drink.
"fu lu shou xi  guairen," I said, or thank you freak of nature.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Bomb ass popcorn chicken. That's all I got to say!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is abnormally SLOW!!!! They take forever to make one drink even if you're the only customer there! And they have pretty horrible customer service!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Slowly! Always mess up my orders. 90% time the drink is way too sweet for me. Even though the owner is nice, I still can't really satisfy...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">this is my first Yelp review, was compelled after this experience. I can only speak to the food. We didn't try the beverages. 

We ordered shrimp and broccoli and Kung Pao chicken both entrees came with white rice and cost $7.99. We also wanted egg rolls, but they were out of egg rolls. Seriously out of egg rolls. When we opened the boxes the ratio of rice to food was ridiculous, a mountain of white rice and hardly any entree. We counted six small shrimps in our shrimp and broccoli. There was virtually no difference in the taste of each dish. When we gave our order the girl asked how spicy we wanted it. We said medium,  it literally had NO FLAVOR. Again, no taste difference in between Kung Pao chicken and the shrimp and broccoli. Also, the Kung Pao consisted mainly of celery, onions, and carrots. Very little chicken. 

This was a total rip-off and we will not be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">my favorite is the milk tea boba. The milk tea by itself is delicious! The boba from time to time seems be inconsistent. The boba can be really fresh and warm or it can be abnormally chewy... BUT the popcorn chicken is mouthwatering! There is different choices between mild, medium, and hot. I choose mild because I'm a wimp. Aside from the boba being inconsistent, the popcorn chicken is four stars hands down.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Have you ever had those cravings where NOTHING will taste good until you satisfy that craving? I've been told by a few guys that they don't get what it is to have a craving. Maybe its a female thing, I don't know. Most recent craving, MANGO SLUSH! 

Unfortunately I don't live in an area that is abundant in Lolicups, Tea Zone, Tapioca Express, and other such establishments. (I live across the street from Placentia). I didn't want to drive all the way to the 626, and I remembered there was one in DTF, still a small ways to go for my slushy.

So sitting at home, cause that's really what I've been doing since my accident, I saw QUICKLY on Yelp. Really, a boba place near close to me?! I so gotta try it.

I ordered the popcorn chicken mild ($3.99) and a mango slush regular ($2.50), no boba.
Popcorn Chicken: Maybe I should have had it hot vs mild. Lacked that kick as well as flavor. A little disappointing when compared to Dolphin Bay in Cerritos/Rowland Heights. 
Mango Slush- A little too sweet for me, didn't satisfy that mango slush craving for me.

Of course they have lots of other items, I'm curious about their squid balls as well as some of their main dishes. Also need to try the taro slush. 

I'm just happy I found my boba place nearby without having to haul ass to the 626...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yeaaaaaaaaa so I think it's about time I write a review about this place. The only drink I get from here is Thai Tea just because I know it's a safe drink.

Scary thing is this one time when I ordered Thai Tea with boba, and literally..I mean literally, a min later... THAI TEA WIT BOBA READY!!

I was waiting patiently and I was like WAHHH?? already?? FFFFFFFFFFFUUU I swear that one time, it tasted like shiz );

-1 for such an empty place next to 99cents store..so empty...
-1 for the menu because it looks so complicated. Yes it's written on the wall of China but dayyumm! Can't they put it together to it's easier to read?
-1 for the atmosphere. Yes if you're hanging out with your friends here..that's quite sad
-1 for the owner? every time when I come in, there's this man/woman? what wears the pink tees. I questions myself all the time...is that a he or she....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm no joke. FML

+1 for taking cards. I have to admit most asian places only do CASH ONLY and don't accept cards.  

I want my drinks to be done in a decent manner..not in a Quickly manner );<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I missed the old owners that were super nice and friendly. We use to come here a few times a week so we can have boba while we study. The old woman was super generous on the boba portions and gave us extra most of the time. The prices are pretty expensive but that is because it is one of the only boba places in Fullerton and near campus. This place started to get pretty crowded this year compared to last year when it was empty. They also remodeled the place so it's a little bit more hip. Sometimes they mix the big and small boba in the same pot and that irritates me since I only like the big boba!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Now I've been going here for the past 4 years... 
Drinks are decent
Food is nothing special

So whenever I was hungry and didn't want to go to starbucks to study, relax and yet have the same lounging environment, I'd come here...with a 3 star service in my opinion

TODAY is a 1 star and now I will avoid this place....
It was empty like normal and I order a jasmine milk tea (no boba)
one lady took my order and a guy made my drink. upon receiving my drink the lady looks at me and says no no! excuse me and asks me to had over the drink...because...get this.. THEY GAVE ME A LARGE INSTEAD OF A REGULAR.. AND THEY POURED THE CONTENTS INTO A SMALL CUP AND HANDED IT TO ME.. WTF?! EWWW... 
Greedy and RUDE.

I'm sure the $100 I've probably paid in the years isn't much but WTF?! you don't do this to ANYONE!! if you mess up say "you've been upgraded! thank you"... argh.. :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place used to be pretty good, but recently they changed ownership sometimes in June, and it has been a big disappointment ever since. If you see reviews with 4 or 5 stars, they were probably given to the previous owner, whom I would've given a 4-stars.

They are very skimpy on food. I ordered a ground pork on rice, I got a box of rice with a small sprinkle of meat, to a point where it was just a box of rice with only soy sauce. It was during the first week of new ownership, so I cut them some slack.

I went back to give them a second chance a month later. Same dish, they gave me a tiny tad bit more meat this time, but significantly lacking in comparison to all other asian restaurants that serve the same dish. Not to mention, the rice was so hard, part of it felt like it wasn't cooked through. The taste is nothing to brag about.

They also frequently run out of ingredients. I used to get papaya milk from there all the time (with previous owner). With these new folks, they didn't stock enough papaya. Watermelon was in the season, so I saw a lot of those sitting in the back behind the counter. They asked if I would want a watermelon smoothie instead. I don't even know what to say.

Don't waste your time. You will be disappointed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had a boba craving and this was the closest place from my friend's house. It's a big location compared to other Quickly locations; tons of seating. The place is clean as well but there was no public restroom. There's a hallway where the restroom is located but it was blocked off by two large box trash can things (like the ones at McDonalds).

Looking at the menu, it was so confusing. It had the typical menu you'd find a normal Quickly. Now, imagine a bunch of pieces of paper labeled with "Large" and different pricings all over the menu, items covered, items added, menu made out of paper listing more items and different flavors, cup sizes, etc.......... so, yeah. Okay.

I ordered the large strawberry milk tea with boba, almond milk tea with boba, and the BBQ pork fried rice. The strawberry milk was good, made just like other places I've been to. The boba was not fresh and was very chewy; not good. My friend didn't even finish half of his almond milk tea and threw it away. The BBQ pork fried rice confused me. It has some pieces of BBQ pork but had more chicken than anything. There weren't any veggies (carrots, peas, etc.) in the fried rice, the rice itself was very brown in color (too much soy sauce) and there wasn't much. $6.99 for like half an order of fried rice from an actual Chinese restaurant... what a waste.

Customer service was all right. Nothing spectacular.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually come here when I'm on a break at school. I think their boba is decent. I like that they have a large selection on their menu. I've only had their popcorn chicken and garlic fries so far. My favorite thing from here is probably the ginormous milk tea boba cup. It's huge!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good place for cheap boba but the quality is pretty bad. The laday that normally is there doesn't speak alot of english and usually takes my order in a rush. 
I didn't give one star because its...decent. But I can't give more because product and service is... Shabby. Id rather spend $2 extra for some good tasting boba. This is why I'd rather drive the way to downtown fullerton, the boba and atmosphere is a lot better. 
On the other hand, it gets 2 stars because I was going here for about 2 years. It was because their milk tea boba was very cheap at the time. Now I can't drink their milk tea boba without feeling sick... Great thing? Their regular is now a large cup and you can super cup for a small price.

I read someone else's review saying they have a large menu... I think that can be bad though. Because you know they don't specialize in making it all... I'm scared most of it is just frozen...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst boba I've EVERRR had. Utter garbage! I know I'm from Norcal and Socal has different flavors from us, but I'm not stupid. I hate this Quickly's for trying to trick their customers with their unsatisfying and ridiculously overcooked mushy sorry excuses for boba. They're super cheap too, they force customers to buy larger sizes, saying they're out of the smaller ones...when their menu clearly says the smaller cups (the same exact size EVERYONE has) are ONLY for juices. 

Their setup is stupid too. No napkins are avaliable, you have to ask for it. When I asked the lady for it, she gave me ONE napkin...I was sitting with a group of 4...are we supposed to split it up or something??

Chicken was good, a little fattier than I'm used to, but its not something to deter me from eating it. At least I know a place close to CSUF where I can get my popcorn chicken on!

Note: We ordered milk tea, jasmine milk tea, peach slush, and Thai teas, all decent, just not the pearls. I have also been to other Quickly's that do a lot better than this trash.

Edit: Went back to give them a chance to redeem themselves...not too bad. Milk tea was fine, boba was fine...egg pudding was NASTY. You're not supposed to give customers the top layer of egg pudding because it gets gritty and nasty...guess what was in my drink? 2.5stars for the "redemption".<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Tried the Chicken entree and found the chicken to be heavily coated in what looks like coarse bread crumbs /cornmeal of some sort. 

Rice well.....not sure what type of steam rice it was flakey<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ok so I tried Quickly Chinese Food tonight for the first time. My boyfriend and we're craving Chinese and our usual place is in Anaheim. But we wanted to try something close to home. So we've done it and it's  good. I got Curry Chicken and Combination Chow Mein. And my boyfriend got Beef Noodle Soup and Chicken with Steak.  I tasted a little of the soup and loved it. The Curry Chicken was of mild taste not to strong which is fine same with the Combination Chow Mein. The best thing out of this is the free milk tea I got......which is absolutely yummy!!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They should change the name to "slowly." We waited over 20mins for Jasmin milk tea and oolong tea...!!! They were out of popcorn chicken and it was only like 3pm...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good place to get a quick Taiwanese bite, especially in the middle of nowhere (I mean Fullerton).  The quality of food is ok, quantity is pretty good.  The drinks are good also.  Only one shortcoming, the A/C is just not strong enough.  By the time I finished the beef noodle soup, I was already soaking wet and dying.  NOT a good idea to drink hot soup - in the summer!  Not here!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's encrypted in my genes to love boba. I tried the tapioca milk tea and it was not bad for $1.50, which is their current special. It came out in less than 5 minutes and the boba all had a consistent texture. However, it was barely colder than room temp and could have used more ice. Ironically, the temperature of the drink matched the server's mood. Maybe if I ordered in Cantonese, she wouldn't have been so angry looking? Asian people love it when you speak in their native tongue...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Rating based on boba--it's amazing! So good. Peach flower tea with boba is my favorite.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My kids and I were craving boba so we stopped here since it's the only place nearby. They should change their name to SLOWLY instead of Quickly! We waited over 10 minutes for 2 large thai tea boba drinks!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm a boba lover and  normally go to Eden Cafe in DTF (highly recommend). We really only come to this location when we don't feel like driving to DTF, or our other boba places are closed for the holiday e.g. 4th of July. 
I gave this place two stars only because
1. Its close to home and they're quick with your order
2. Their regular size is what I'd definitely consider a large and their drink prices are cheap.

That being said, I'll explain why I knocked three stars off:
1. Come here if you want quantity, not quality. Its not the worst I've had, but DAMN. Sometimes the tea I get tastes SO artificial. Their boba balls are generally soft though so it could be worse.
2. I ordered Mongolian beef on one occasion. DO NOT ORDER THE FOOD. The meat was good but it came out so fast I'm pretty sure it was some frozen food dish. Also, the portion of rice to meat was ridiculous! For $7,  I expected a little more than two tablespoons of beef with over half a plate of rice.
3. While I was eating the rice to try and fill my still starving belly (again, because there was hardly any meat), I discovered a hair in it, and it definitely wasn't mine. Yup. Definitely wasn't hungry after that. 

Waste of $7. ONLY go for boba when you need a cheap fix.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst popcorn chicken ever. That's all I had there and it was foul enough to guarantee that there will not be a return visit. The portion was huge and maybe that was an indication that they needed to get rid of it before it went even more off. I do not think I've ever thrown my food away after only a couple bites (& have suffered the consequences through the years), but maybe I'm finally wise enough to know that eating bad chicken just so that I don't waste $4.50 is no victory.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Rude service! And mediocre boba. The food is okay but over priced. French fries were terrible.
Only thing I would get here is the milk tea special $1.50 but don't count on anybody being nice to you.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Cheap boba near CSU Fullerton. Tasty too!

Bottomline: It's helpful that they take credit cards too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">$1.50 boba and fast service - not bad if you're in a rush.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The boba milk tea is pretty good at this location but the price is high.  I felt like I was paying starbuck prices.  I guess I shouldn't complain too much considering the location but I had just visited the Quickly in San Gabriel which was cheaper and I got better service.  They have a supercup of milk tea boba for $3.58, which is a deal, which I should have gotten.    

Also, they had no public restroom, boo.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Cheap...

Watered Down....

Not Good. 

Not much to say...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Decent boba place for a college student's budget. 

If you're hungry, try the orange chicken there. Buuuuut it is over-priced.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Of the three Quicklys I have been to, this one is the best so far. Their sizes are really good compared to the one near my house and the milk tea boba is my favorite. The girls who work there are always super nice and friendly. This is definitely my favorite one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This was my first time at this particular Quickly and I have no complaints. Milk tea was good and boba was fresh.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I rarely leave a bad review but this place is gross. The food is very bad quality! The portions are tiny and everything is very over priced considering those things. To top it all off The service is awful too! Sooooo bad!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered the taro milk tea and it tasted more like taro milk without the tea. It's an extra 75 cents to add boba/jelly. Drink came out to $3.28!! I thought this was quickly, where boba is cheap!?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So I was craving some chinese food and was in the Fullerton area. "Quickly" came up in my search. It seemed to be somewhat busy. I wasn't too impressed with the decor or cleanliness of this place but soon was forgotten when we were helped by the very friendly woman working the register. I have never had Boba so we ordered one of those and then ordered our food to go. We ordered the Orange chicken and a meat dish and some steamed rice. The food was okay, was not totally impressed.
I thought the preparation of the boba was weird, she poured it from a gallon jug which looked very unsanitary but I am all for trying something out. It was good, it was chocolatey and it was so weird when the tapioca balls would come through the straw. I am obviously a boba virgin! I might try this place again. Or maybe try and find a cleaner looking chinese take out.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They have a large menu here full of drinks and food. But I only come here for the boba. This place never disappoints! The boba is sweet and has good texture. The milk tea is a lot creamier than other places where their milk teas seem a little watery.

It's a lot bigger than the other two locations I've been to. The only downside is the fact that they don't have the dollar boba deals like their locations in Rowland Heights and Cerritos. It's still good, so I'm not complaining.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">People are nice. Boba isn't the best but its convenient and the prices are okay.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is usually the place I go if I'm having a boba craving and I'm not in the mood to drive very far. The only real issue I've ever had with this location is the wait time every so often. I've never had a problem when I order my drinks, but I like to keep things simple. Almond, Jasmine, Taro, and Honey Milk Teas with boba are the only beverages I've ordered from here. Overall I would say it depends on what you get that will determine if this place is rated a three or four stars.

I almost always buy lunch/dinner as well whenever I come here. They always make the food fresh to order, so you  can be assured that the food will be hot and very fresh when received. The first time I decided to order food along with my Boba, I chose the Crispy Chicken Rice. I had assumed it would be something akin to a fried rice, however what I got was their popcorn chicken with a generous amount of steamed rice and a fried egg with a small amount of some type of dark sauce on it. It wasn''t what I had expected, but it was good nonetheless. I've also tried their Orange chicken that they seem to be known for, and it was okay, but near the end it was much too sweet for my liking.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here twice, for the food.  I'm sure the milk tea is fine, because that's their main line of business.  The popcorn chicken here is really sad.  It's like the chicken they made it from was sad and hungry.  Well, I was sad and hungry too, after I finished their popcorn chicken.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">OK this place totally sucks but I keep coming back. Whyyyyyy?!? Probably because the friggin giant ass milk tea with boba is $3.89. wtfbbqsauce?! That's cheap as hell. It's horrible and the milk is way too creamy. I suspect they use powdered milk or some really sweet crap, but Hey! You get like a 32 ounce jug for your $4 bucks. I mean, if they're going to give you some really shitty milk tea, they might as well give you a gang of it right? Right?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When my boyfriend I ordered the man at the registered said stated, "This will be the best orange chicken you will ever have." We nodded and laughed and pretty much generally ignored the man's comment. Until, he brought over the steaming hot plate of orange chikeny goodness. My boyfriend took just one bite of the fresh, pan fried, sticky goodness and said, "Oh my god. It's the best orange chicken I've ever had."

This place is a little hole in the wall in a random shopping center, but from my experience these places are usually the tastiest. And man, was I right! The service is fast and the food is inexpensive as well. I've had the egg flower soup, wanton soup and the cream cheese wantons - they weren't as life changing as the orange chicken but still very good.

Chinese food will never be the same now. I hate Quickly for ruining orange chicken for me, but love it because I don't  live to far!  :o)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Terrible drinks, probably one of the worst green tea there is. Tastes like glue in the water.
If you want good taste tea, look else where, this is definitely not the good place to get any kind of tea.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">ORIGINAL & UNIQUE ORANGE CHICKEN! 

If you are looking to try a completely different take on Orange Chicken and Chinese food then you must try this place. This place has one of the most original takes on Orange Chicken I have ever tasted. 

One day I was in the mood for Chinese food and asked a friend where I should go because I wanted something I haven't tried yet in the area of Fullerton. The Hanz suggested I try Quickly Chinese Food because they have some amazing Orange Chicken and it's different. Well after trying it I would have to agree with him. The price was a little more than I cared to pay, but the portions are large enough that you actually get two meals out of it so it's really not too bad. I ordered their Orange Chicken, fried rice, and a small order of egg rolls. Their Orange Chicken came out with a different, fresher batter that was a little harder and crunchier than most Orange Chickens I have tried. It was really good and the sauce they poor over it was amazing. Something sweet and tangy, but not overpowered by sugar like Panda Express or those junk-food chains. This meal tasted a lot fresher, which is why it stood out in taste and style because of the way they cooked and prepared it. It's hard to explain so just go try it yourself!

They also have some great boba teas! They have a huge variety of flavors so if you're not that hungry and feel like a nice little treat boba tea always hits the spot. I love the little tapioca balls at the bottom.


If you love Chinese food and want to try something unique and different then this place is a must try!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Usually if I go somewhere once and it's bad I'll try it again.  If it's bad twice, never again.  However since Quickly is the only boba place I don't have to get on the freeway for..it got a thrid chance.  

There was a few people inside and the couple that owns it was running around like crazy.  I waited probably 15 miniutes for my food and drink.  This time it was actually pretty good though.  My thai tea was actually cold...I think cause the lady was so stressed she didn't realize she put more than 3 ice cubes in.  The orange chicken was really good and a HUGE portion.

Maybe you will get a fourth chance Quickly.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is legit for the Daily specials.
Don't expect the best customer service.
Everything is made on order ( taste like it)
Foods great, I've only had the $1.50 milk tea and that seems average.
overall I would eat here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is OK. It's not first on my list for boba craving fulfillment, but it gets the job done. I like their honeydew milk tea, but there's still bits of the powder packed together when ever I sip. My girlfriend loves this place because of their eggplant plate, which I think is pretty good. It's like Guppies except a little more small and cheaper.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best 'fast food' chinese restaurant I've found near my work which doesn't use chafing dishes. They don't use the best quality rice, but for the price you can't complain too much. Service is very good.

The orange chicken is pretty good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good for college students on a budget.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is okay, the drinks are okay, the food is okay. The lady is hilarious, she can be very mean but sometimes shes super nice, they are not open on Sundays I believe its a family run quickly's and they probably have church on sundays. It smells really asian but I noticed that with ALL quickly's, maybe its just a quickly's thing. okay boba, nothing special, boom done!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have a never-ending craving for their chicken chow mein. Sure, it was a bit greasy, but that's what makes it so delectable. The thick noodles and the chicken are so flavorful that it really takes care of that crave. I didn't expect it to be so delicious that one night when I was starved for anything and came across this, but I've returned again and again... mmm.

The place is spacious and pretty much empty later in the evening, but that just means it's ready sooner!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay, so the drinks are usually sweet (slush drinks). Boba is standard.

Let's get down to the real reason I'm writing this. This place is my little gem for quick, tasty, authentic Chinese. Sometimes I order take-out and just opt to eat there because it's hard to want to wait till I get home.

Spicy garlic eggplant is delicious and piping hot when served. 
The orange chicken is my favorite...the crunchiest and most delicious I've ever had.
The chow mein is also amazing.

Overall, an affordable and quality place for Chinese takeout.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Friends and I had a boba craving one night and this Quickly location was the only place open.  Got the almond snow with boba and I felt like it was pretty standard, no complaints.  One weird thing was that they only sell the "Super Cup" or whatever it is called, looks like the Half & Half cup, and the taller large size.  There was no "regular/medium" type of option.  So, you're kind of forced to get a huge drink.  I'd come back if I was in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As much as I hate Lollicrap, I'd rather have the tea there than here. 

The milk tea I ordered didn't even have a hint of tea--and yes, it does bother me when tea gets poured out of a gallon jug. A pitcher, I (somewhat, hesitatingly) understand, but where did that gallon jug come from? XD

(Then again, maybe I don't want to know.)

At least the name fits. The tea was in my hand quickly, and I was outta there pretty quickly! ;) (Went here once and once only.)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here after craving hole-in-the-wall Chinese. This is definitely the place. I had the kung pao chicken, my boyfriend had Mongolian Beef. It's pretty Americanized Chinese food, not as tasty as Pick-up Stix or Panda Express, it's probably because they use less sodium.  I also got the honey green tea with rainbow jelly (pretty good).

I was originally going to give this place 3 1/2 stars: 3 for the food, 1/2 for the customer service (staff were friendly and patient) but upon my boyfriend's insistence, kicking it up to 4 stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quickly has decent chinese food and decent drinks. Why 4 stars?

- The owner was REALLY nice and friendly. 
- I loved the Sauteed Eggplant in Spicy Garlic Sauce. Ok, it wasn't spicy but nothing a little srichaca couldn't fix!
- Food and drink came out REALLY fast!
- Their milk tea OK. I will stick with their food and maybe try a slushy type drink next time
- I can study here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really like this Quickly. I typically come here after going to the gym. (yes I know it's bad for you.) The service here is great although at times slow. I believe there's only 2-3 workers and that may be the reason why it can get slow during busy hours. The woman that works here knows me pretty well since I come here almost once a week.

This place is one of the few places that actually have Wintermelon Juice. If you don't know what it is, try it. It tastes better with boba I believe.

The popcorn chicken here is delicious and consistent. You have to try the spicy one. There's something in it that makes it so dam addicting. It might be the MSG or something, but it's like eating crack. Top it off with some Sriracha chili sauce and you got one unhealthy appetizer.

They also have Wi-Fi here for your internet needs. Be sure to ask for a stamp card. I think the workers will only stamp for drinks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I got a lychee slushie here and asked for a little bit of boba and lychee jelly.

What I got was 1/2 a cup of WARM boba, a little jelly, and some slushy.

You'd think I'd be giving much less than 3 stars? Well, I mixed the boba in and let it cool down with the slushy and then enjoyed the most DELICIOUS boba I've tasted yet. So 1/2 cup = yay.

Oh and they DON'T HAVE MOCHI. :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've only had the boba milk and passion fruit w/ green tea a few times.  The taste is average at best, each item is overly sweet and the boba could be fresher.  However, they aren't bad, just average.  The prices are pretty expensive as well.  Good grief. 

However, i went in the other night to get shaved ice.  I found out from the owner that none of their materials are fresh.  EVERYTHING is out of a can and the ingredients tasted and looked the part.  I had ordered green bean, egg pudding, almond jello, and one other thing i can remember.  Since i had already paid, i figured i'd give the shaved ice a shot...   

What i got instead of all my ingredients mixed together was two separate containers with 2 ingredients each in them.  Also there was no condensed milk placed on top and very little sugar water in each.   I've NEVER been to a legit Chinese boba dessert store and had my items separated.....

Needless to say, the dessert tasted horrible and i was not told about the splitting of the items.  Awful, just awful.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had come in here a few years back and remember it being not good and pretty expensive.  Tonight I wanted some fast Chinese food that wasn't Pick Up Stix and Silver Chopsticks was closed.  So I came in here after seeing it on Yelp and go the mapo tofu.  It was decent, a bit spicier than I thought a medium would be but I would probably order it again, I do agree that it needed a little minced meat on there though.  The lady behind the counter was nice and the food came pretty quick(ly, lolz).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Even though the prices at this franchise have recently gone up (stupid economy), I still love the food here.  

The Mongolian Beef is saucy and delicious.  

The fried chicken, is the appetizer to end all appetizers.  They make it as spicy as you want, and it is boneless - so it makes snacking on them easier.

The boba is great, but don't forget that they have a HUGE drink selection to choose from.  So don't be afraid to try something new.

The staff is very friendly and helpful too.  Just a great Mom and Pop place to eat at.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Wanted something refreshing before my long night of class.

Stopped by in here (damn the place itself is pretty big, good place to chill and/or study).

Drinks were same price as everywhere else such as Tapioca Express. Had the bubble green tea.  It was good and refreshing.

Can't wait to come back and try the spicy chiken bites. I'm always craving that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quickly's one of my favorite places to visit when I am at CSUF. I come here to get their boba drinks and sometimes I get the lunch special with a boba drink, too! 

They have an array of different choices that come with rice for the lunch special (ends at 3:30PM) that ranges from 4.99-6.99. Such items I've tried are: Chicken Chop Suey, Orange Chicken, and Mongolian beef. The Chicken Chop Suey had a good flavor, but I disliked the celeries that they put in it. Also, the photo of the dish at the store has more vegetables, like green beans and mushrooms, but those items weren't in my dish when I ordered it! The orange chicken is tasty and is not covered in battered with little meat like many other places. The Mongolian beef is also a good choice because it's simple and quick to eat. 

I usually get teas over smoothies. I've tried their strawberry&yogurt slush before and it was a disappointment, so now I stick to teas. I usually get the honey, peach, or assorted fruit tea (strawberry, mango, pineapple). The boba here is pretty good as well; however, it is obvious when you get new or old boba-- old boba is harder to bite, but still tastes good.. in my opinion. lol 

One last thing-- owners/workers are very nice here! They always ask you what you need, how sweet you want your drink, etc. =)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nice friendly place. Budin and Boba drink was unique. Pop corn chicken was great; kids loved them. It looks like a remodel new place. Must be a new owner.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a favorite for chinese food. The garlic eggplant is some of the best i've had. It's not over cooked and mushy. It's perfect and the sauce is delicious. The ma po tofu is delicious too if you're looking for something spicy and flavorful. All of the food comes out extra hot! (temperature wise, not spicy) maybe because they cook it "quickly"? I like it like that.

They have a huge selection of drinks! My favorite is the coconut milk tea. They also have Boba and jellies to add to the drinks. The coconut milk tea with the coconut jellies is just ridiculously tasty.

Everyone has been very friendly, no matter who is at the counter. The older asian guy is especially very nice and talkative.

This place from the outside does not look good, but it really is a hidden gem. This inside is spacious and modern looking. I like the art they have on the walls. There is not usually a whole lot of people in here. I wish this place would get more business, they deserve it. I've been there many times without any complaints.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's really ironic because quickly's was the slowest restaurant I've ever been to. Took 30 minutes or more just to get my popcorn chicken. Boba was watery.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">While the food is not that spectacular, it's good enough to come on occasions for CSUF students! Their drinks are pretty good. It sucks that this branch does not have $0.75 milk tea boba offers like the one in Rowland Hts.

And the person behind the counter is really kind!

The only sucky thing is that their restrooms are usually locked, for some odd reason. So usually you'd have to request a person to unlock it for you. The place is meh in terms of cleanliness<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not worth checking out. Menu is sooooo hard to understand, prices are unreasonable, a lot more than any other Quickly I've been to. Ordered a Thai tea. Tea sits out all day on the counter, server just pours milk in. Extremely sweet too! Makes sense why this place is so empty. Will not be returning.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The boba was delicious and cheap. I got an enormous boba cup wiht boba for $4. Unfortunately, the popcorn chicken was pretty gross and I got it spicy but all I tasted was spice & no flavor. It was like eating wasabi chicken without the flavor just the spice. I just went there because it closed at 10 and was the closest boba place I could find near CSUF.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Cheap and delicious boba in the area ! Of course, there are better Boba places if you are willing to drive, but i think in fullerton this place is the best ! Its a tiny whole in the wall. The help is very friendly. Nice choices of drinks. I didn't eat the food so I can't speak to that, but I definitely recommend for Boba.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a decent place for boba.  The menu is rather confusing because there are pieces of paper written in Chinese taped under the menu.  I'm assuming these are other drinks and food dishes.  I didn't try the food, so I can't say anything about that.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">its has a new owner they revamp the menu more selection and the price went up a bit but overall its the only boba place in fullerton area i dont mind comin back for some nik naks and some milk tea lol<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love their orange chicken. Their boba selection is very wide and delicious. They have friendly service and remember regular customers.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">3 years ago my girlfriend got take out from here for us (our first time trying this place) and on the way back she got in a car accident....hence forth we've both had a thing against this place. 

My typical stop for a quick Chinese lunch or boba would be Tapioca Express across the street and since that AND the other boba place across the street (Tea Zone?) both closed down recently for an L&L (yay!) and Pinkberry (boo!) when I had a craving for a quick authentic Chinese style lunch I had to resort to Quickly. 

When I went in (my first time inside) it was nice and spacious - the lady behind the counter was very friendly with her broken English and automatically switched to speaking only Mandarin when she found out I understood it. I got the ma po tofu and a watermelon juice - the ma po tofu had a good flavor but I was hoping for some kind of shredded or minced pork with it (it was just tofu and sauce) and the watermelon juice was very good, not too sweet and very smooth. 

I'm glad I tried it and I'll be back whenever I have a craving for Chinese food to try the other things on the menu (eggplant in garlic sauce is next).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Because of the review on here in regard to the fresh watermelon juice, I decided to try out Quickly.  So to accommodate my watermelon juice, I ordered a mild order of popcorn chicken.

The watermelon juice was quite tasty and refreshing, I must say.  I don't think I've ever had watermelon juice prior, but that review persuaded me to try it.  It essentially tasted like straight up watermelon, but in liquid form.  I wasn't expecting the texture to be so smooth; it was very easy going down the throat.  No seeds, so that's another plus.  Definitely recommend this if someone wants to try something new.

Onto the popcorn chicken...I didn't think it was that great.  The chicken had this unnatural sweet taste to it, which I did not like at all.  I've never had anything like this, and needless to say the sweetness was just not good.  It just seemed like a strange pairing; I'd definitely get popcorn chicken from other local boba places if I had a craving for it.

Overall, I'm sure you can't go wrong with the drinks.  And who knows, you may like the popcorn chicken too, but it definitely was not for me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They have a promotion going on right now...$1.50 for tapioca milk tea, that is actually a great deal but one thing that I don't like about that place is the service. The lady that works there has an attitude, she gave me 2 dollars extra back and I told her about it and she gave me an attitude, which is pretty weird. The food and the drink there is pretty good just like other locations.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i always get their black peppered beef and ice green tea. the food are quite good, but the service, ehhh its ok, they can be rude sometime tho.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ooh! Ooh! Quickly!! What a fucking treat, I love Quickly.

The food is delicious, the drinks are, for the most part, not too sweet (and I'm particular about sweetness; I prefer subtle flavors). Don't actually expect the food to be as quick as their name insinuates, though. This is a very good thing and I appreciate it - none of that microwave shit going on here. It's all made fresh for you! This particular Quickly has such friendly owners and employees, I always end up smiling and happy while I'm there. I can't help but feel I'm sitting at my grandparents' house sometimes (minus the decor and the giant tv - my grandparents only had a radio, as far as I remember. Oh, and they weren't Asian).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Quickly I have never been let down by one so far. I love this one because it is possibly the one place out here I can go when I am homesick for the bay area that reminds me of home seeing as we have Quickly everywhere up there. But yes this is my favorite place to go I am happy there is one in Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">i'd have to agree with the previous (first) post.  The food isn't amazing- but it's cheap and better than panda express.  It's not really americanized chinese food- but it's not quite all that authentic.   I really like their ma po tofu, which I order all the time w/ a honey milk tea :)

This place reminds me of a tapioca express- but better.  The quality is better and it's never super packed- and the owners/workers are always really nice! I think I am going tonight for a quick dinner! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Better than Panda Express, that's for sure.  I've only tried their orange chicken with chow mein, and that was actually pretty scrumptious.  Friendly Chinese couple runs the place.  Lots of seating for dining and chilling on the couches.  They have cheap, delicious boba here too for when I need a study break.  I will definitely be coming back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I pretty much got constipation from their Tapioca Milk Tea from yesterday. It was my second time there because their boba are better than Tap on St. College. So I ordered a Tapioca Milk Tea yesterday and the bobas were NOT FRESH. It was soft on the outter edges but hard to chew from the inside. So I went back to get another one. When they gave me a new one, they forgot to put in the ice for me. WTH. I could've gotten more than constipation if I had stick with the first boba. 

NEVER going back there again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quick, cheap, and free wi-fi. A couple other Quickly locations I've been to do not compare to this one at all. It's very spacious inside, equipped with couches and a coffee table. The decor is cute without trying too hard. The staff is always friendly to me, especially the owners.

The food isn't amazing, but it's like Chinese fast food that's more authentic than Panda Express. Can't go wrong with fried rice. Their ma po tofu is good, and so is their chow mein.

Their drinks consist of different milk teas, iced coffees, blended fruit drinks, and papaya milk! If you've never tried papaya milk, this is the place to get it. I'm slightly lactose intolerant, so my stomach went a little weird after drinking it, but is that gonna stop me?? Of course not. And who knows, they might even have Soy Milk, I just never bothered to ask. Oh yes, and if you're a boba lover, they have that here, too.

This is one of my preferred locations to chill between classes and browse the web. Not overcrowded like Yogurtland on the opposite corner.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I think this place must be under new management. It used to be really good, but the food I got today was nothing like it used to be. Way too pricey for this quality food. Very disappointed. I won't be coming here anymore.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love boba drinks, this is one of my favorite place!  Though I don't come this area often any more.  I drop by today to get me and my friends boba milk tea, everyone enjoys it!! After long day of work, this is the best pick me up drink..... not as strong on caffeine compare to coffee drinks, and less calories compare to candy bars, and so refreshing.  Yes!  Boba for me anytime  :))<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered a milk tea, forgot to say "no boba" but the cashier lady didn't give me the option. As soon as I saw the other employee putting boba in my cup, I asked if I could have it without boba, therefore making him throw it out and make a whole new cup of milk tea only. I could tell she was irritated by her tone of voice. Service sucks and the drinks are warm and watery.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Quickly offers some delicious chinese food at a low price.  Orange Chicken and Kung Pao Beef are two solid options.  The Boba is good, but the blender unfortunately maybe completely broken.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is absolutely unsanitary and disgusting. I came here once and the lady coughed in my drink... the second time I went, their premade milk tea is in a bucket sitting on the floor and for the second time she coughed in my drink. I told her about the incident yet she still did it!!!! Avoid this quickly in all necessary means!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">the intersection of chapman and state college has 3 boba/food places. the south east side is quickly, i think the lowest rated of the 3 places. this place does have a variety of food as well as drinks, but it's a bit pricey compared to the other 2 and they aren't very generous with their portions.

i do have to agree that the service is great, but that's because it's usually pretty empty in there. the only reason i come here often is become it's quiet and i get free internet!! i come here to study before classes and feed myself.

another thing i like about this place is that it's decorated pretty nicely and it's clean. they have two ikea couches for the people who are doing take out. it's very colorful and modern inside.

oh, and they take credit cards!! unlike tea zone..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I must agree with Peter N.'s review 100%. Wanting to grab a quick/non expensive bite to eat, some of us saw quickly's review on yelp and decided to give it a try since I'm a huge fan of watermelon juice and it's literally down the street from where they live. Not only is their juices fresh, they don't dilute it with water or add nasty sweetner in there which i absolutely LOVE! it's definitely quenches your thirsts after having the perfectly deep fried popcorn chicken bites. Don't expect amazing service, or great decor, but this place definitely deserves 4 stars for a fast food-esque chinese food place, which is hard to find in orange county. The lady that works there can't speak English all too fluently but I felt the service was good for only having 2-3 workers in the whole place. She was super friendly and welcoming. For drinks we ordered a fresh watermelon juice (DELICIOUS) and a green tea yogurt drink which was pretty good as well. We also ordered the beef satay chow mein (delicious!) and the orange chicken with steamed rice ( i felt the sauce was a lil too sweet but my bf thought it was bomb "some of the best orange chicken I have ever had") the garlic toast was to die for, we were expecting a slab of butter and some garlic of toast but they seasoned it with all sorts of herbs and goodness like thyme, parsley, basil, nutmeg which made for a superior garlic toast bread, perfectly toasted... yum... oh yeah, "the popcorn chicken was like crack... sooo gooood, crackcrackadilicious". Also, there are 2 menus, the lady said it was the "caucasian menu" which had your expected orange chicken, fried rice, beef brocoli etc. But there is also a 'Chinese menu" that has more of a variety and traditional dishes. The best part is, everything was from 1.50 to no more than $6 bucks a plate. and afterwards... and afterwards we went next door to the 99 cent store and grab a candy for dessert.. yay :-)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've only been here twice, and both times I got chow mein because I have no imagination. It was really good. Just sayin'.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food seems healthy and their slushes are exceptional. My gf and I ordered the mongolian beef...it was good but the portion size was a bit small to fill me up. Their lychee slush really hit the spot though. I eat ice cream by the mouthful, but their slushes are so cold that even I could not handle them...awesome<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">this place reminds me of home.. i'm originally from the birth of all quickly's! but good stuff i love their popcorn chicken and fries.. i love it with the spicy paprika! and their boba is not the best.. but it'll do<p>
</p></p>
