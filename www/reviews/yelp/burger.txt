<p itemprop="description">I've come here a few times at night - drive through.

The service is great.  Although they're not as fast as other chains, they're super friendly and they make sure your order is correct.

They may be a little slow because its after 11pm, so they may only have two people.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just got back to work from ordering 3 orders of the 10 pc. chicken nuggets from here.
Seems like they cooked it at 6:00am this morning. they are hard and dry and cold. Not good at all. A waste of $1.49. Who wants old hard cold food???<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I when here to try their new hot dog.  I did try the Chili dog and the regular grilled dog.  The Chilli dog was good the Chilli has Beans and it does taste good. I really liked the regular grilled hot dog.  The bathroom with very dirty.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We were on our way out of town and wanted some drinks and a kids meal for our son. 

The customer service is terrible with an employee and her boyfriend spreading mulch and then going to the counter to take your order and to handle your food. 

The bathrooms CHARGE YOU to use them even if you just spent money in there, this place should close immediately what a terrible franchise to allow this to happen.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place deserves no stars, the service is horrible and slow, and they somehow always manage to forget my fork and dressing for my salad or they get the wrong dipping sauce i adk for. It has happened multiple times. The only reason i continue to come here is because its convenient. I give it two stars because the facility is nice and clean on the inside and they have free wifi. Theres also tons of bums that gather outside and the city wont do anything about it so the outside dining area is gone.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just went through the drive thru at this location and did not receive my full order. When I tried to call the restaurant I found out that they don't have a valid phone number. How can a business not have a valid phone line for customers to call on?? I have a 6 week old baby and can't just drive back to the restaurant to get my order corrected. I am missing two 10 piece chicken nuggets and furious over it!!! What are you going to do to fix it Burger King?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We went to this Burger King around 12:30 pm on Sunday.  We went through the drive and it took us almost ten minutes just to place our order, although after placing our order we received the food fairly quickly.  I had a Jr. Whopper meal and the bun was so dry it felt like it has sit out over night.  The server was extremely rude, not nice at all.  She gave us a spoon to eat our salad instead of a fork, and I get it, people make mistakes.  But when I went inside to get a fork, there was a couple ahead of me waiting to order and there were 2 girls working the drive through and no one helping the couple inside.  The customer looked at me and said "this is why no one is in here".  Poor management obviously.  I most likely will not visit this Burger King again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just got an A1ultimate  bacon cheese burger with medium soda and medium fries via drive through. When i got back home. I was disappointed... It looks like they are running low on sauce? They only put tiny bit of A1 sauce in my burger and they omitted ketchup. They didnt even bother to ask me if i wanted any sauce.... These aren't worth over $9...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This burger King sucks. And this is just from coming in for the first time ever in the morning. First, the lady who went and took my order looked uninterested and gave me this mean look for no reason at all. Then, i ordered a whopper meal with the hash brown instead of fries. I ask for the hash browns to be well done and crispy. When i got the hash brown they were not well done and obviously she didnt care about my request. And then, the whopper was horrible. The burger itself was cold and the bread was cold too. The whopper seemed like it was made an hour before and they just gave it. You pay like 7.60 or so for a meal thats crap and service thats crap. I would rather go to a sit down restaurant pay that price and give a tip. This place has enployees that dont give a shit and you pay a high price for crap.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">How do you not have soda!!
Substitute for water and pay the same.

Lost my business .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Bk for some milkshakes for the kids. The drive way was okay, but I am concerned for business owners when their staff is oblivious to who is listening to them. The manager of this store talking with the drive thru rep sounded ridiculous, poor topics and foul language. Two kids in my car and these guys are clueless, they were a poor example for their boss.
Tasty milkshakes though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered a large iced coffee and the guy gave me a small iced coffee. So I told him he gave me the wrong size so he filled up the large with ice and just poured the small coffee into a large cup. There was barely any coffee at all!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love burger king but this burger king was gheeeeetttttoooooo no tokens, no ice, smelled funny . That is all<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">NEVER go to this branch ever again! It is horrible ! They were out of soda so I had to order smoothie instead, their fries was spoiled and bad and the employee said that they looked normal! THE MOST DISGUSTING BK EVER!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Burger King. 
But I will NEVER EVER go to *this* Burger King again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was very good but they are very stingy. They actually charged me for using the restroom! This is Burger King! The same Burger King that moved to Canada with Jim Horton's and moved their money to pay a very low tax rate using expatriating (moving money to another country to avoid paying the U.S tax rate). Bring quarters!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have not been to this burger King since they reopened the food is Burger King food however the staff is nice and friendly nowadays the one thing I did not like well are not used to the new soda machine. I guess it would have been cool if the flavors that I actually wanted had been available<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Burger King sucks. The service is bad, there are always homeless people, and they barely have any soda flavors on the new machine.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was reading a few of these articles... and im astonished by some peoples lack of " brightness...or lack of sense who write the articles. Most often a person can take a minute of their time to walk-in...ask for a supervisor and have most issues or praise be given and taken. How we present ourselves to others is how others will treat us.
with that said, i was on lunch, i work at a next door retail location. So having an eatery just next to us is great. It was on 4/18.2015 midday around 2... the lasy who took my order was by herself and it began to get busy. I understand, food and orders and even just people being who they are... Patience is always good. After several minute i began to work...(15min) and luckily the same attendee checked my order and was apologetic about the situation. I didnt get mad i didnt bother her and i didnt show any digust... as others would probably lose it by now. She finally had my order ready, and kindly said she was sorry it took long and that for my patience she placed a bag or newly hot fries (small) for my troubles. I said thank you and walked out... as i walked back to my location i realized how thoughtful she was, how considerate to know that i was a person and not a number. For that i hope the Management recognizes good people like this... and off course ill continue going to this BK...not only for the food , but also for the service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Stopped by to get a bbq bacon whopper, the bacon was missing!

Informed the white collared black tie, bald Hispanic and no action was taken,

Burger was still good, I just wish it had the bacon<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nothing spectacular, dropped in because I saw an ad on TV for their 2 for $5 deal. I guess its the fact that this place is on Harbor Blvd., but there were a few crazy people in the dining area. 

The cool thing is that they have one of those new coke machines that gives you like 100 options. Love having Vanilla Coke!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have been going to this Burger King since I was little.  It sat vacant for many years and now they have remodeled the entire restaurant from the ground up.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very clean, recently remodeled Burger King.  Fresh decor with eight nice booths.  Bathrooms are odd, huge but only allows one person at a time. Be prepared to wait. Desk if they have any specials.  I saved $2 on their two for one sandwich deal by doing so.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went to this Burger King last night and ordered two whoppers. As I started eating one of them I noticed that the lettuce pickles and tomato were super hot and soggy, as though they had been microwaved or something, normally I wouldnt have ate it but I had not eaten all day so I wolfed it down. 

I get to my second whopper hoping that it was going to be much better than the first one, nope it had the exact same problem. Not even 15 minutes after finishing my whoppers my stomach starts swirling and I have a sensation to go to the bathroom. Today my stomach is still messed up and I cant keep nothing in. 

I used to come here for the cheap whoppers, but I think after last night I will stay away from this Burger King....unless you want the swirlies stay away!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">standard BK - dine in has one of those coke machines that have like a million options.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">DOLLAR WHOPPER!!!!
HOLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

&& I love their BK Mocha Joe's!

There are a lot of employees working at a single time so the wait isn't ever bad, unless there's a lot of people there, but then a wait would be expected, of course.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">99 cent whopper.  Same owner as one on lincoln in the east anaheim center. 

Way to gooooooooooooooooo!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This placed stopped doing $.99 Whoppers. :(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">slowest fast food ever....<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was assaulted with a double cheeseburger by an employee at this location.  Horrible customer service.  You can read more about it here: http://www.waynejohn.com/the-time-when-a-burger-king-employee-threw-a-double-cheeseburger-at-me/<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great service! Friendly employees!!
Reese pie is sooooo delicious
Clean restaurant fast service<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst $4.95 I spent. Haven't been to Burger King in about 10 years and decided to swing by. Was excited to try the macncheetos after seeing several raving photos. I'm pretty sure they forgot to warm mine up. The inside was filled with cold, dry mac n cheese. It tasted like eating leftover Mac n cheese from the night before. Vanilla ice coffee tasted like syrup. Gross and gross.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually don't review fast food because there's not much to expect from fast food. But this place was terrible. The cashier Tanyelle wasn't even paying attention to anything I had to say! Lol She was just staring and looking at some dude dancing around for her. Boyfriend or something. I even got a free soda because once I did get my order, she didn't even remember she gave me a cup and asked if she gave me a soda so ofcourse I said no. Lol Most of the people here ain't even eating. They just come in and chill. Oh well, something quick to feed my son. Probably won't be back to this location though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Negative stars if I could! I've been reading the reviews and it looks like they will never change! Yesterday we went and no joke the staff was fighting and cursing at each other and the guy who looked in charge was like calm down guys! They didn't listen they had no respect for him for anybody! They forgot to give me my kids fries and when I went to ask for them they didn't even apologize  just said here and that was it. There soda machines smelled so bad all the tables were dirty! Also when the staff was fighting three costumers came in and saw the mess and drama and they left! Owner of this store I don't know how you have managed to stay open all this time! Never ever going back here again! And my chicken fried were stale!!!!!!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Fast food is notorious for bad costumer service but this place takes the cake. 
The server gave me the wrong item, and it was more expensive then what I ordered. When I let her know that it wasn't what I ordered, instead of fixing it she replied "Yeah, well that's what I gave you." Then just stared at me like she expected me to take it anyway and leave.  

They have two coke machines in the dining room, one was out of order the other had no carbonation. I asked if they could fill up my drink behind the counter and they said that one was out of order too. So I got tea... maybe next time tell me you don't have soda before selling me one. 

Place is hot inside and dirty. Horrible food quality compared to other Burger Kings.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place has no air-conditioning. What's worse, when you tell the manager that she tells you there IS air-conditioning. She also says that next week they're going to get it fixed. Go figure! 

How can they claim to have air conditioning, and claim that it's not broken now, and yet also claim that they're going to get it fixed next week? When I asked this poor excuse for a manager, Lizabeth, to let me talk to somebody whom I could understand, she turned her back on me and serviced the drive-thru window. I waited there 4 feet away from her for five minutes while she continued to ignore my request before I walked away, removed my long sleeve shirt, and settle down for a sweaty meal.

The windows drip with moisture. One Coke machine is broken. The other Coke machine dribbles out one ice cube at a time as if they were diamonds. At lunch hour, their busiest time, we ate there virtually alone. The very few others customers who braved that 90-degree hell-hole were gone in like 3 minutes.

One of the English-speaking counter girls suggested that my sweating friend should stand underneath one of the air conditioning vents. Me and my friend tried standing under every vent in their ceiling without detecting a breath of air from any of them.  Because, like I say, this place has no air-conditioning even though their rude manager, Lizabeth, says they do.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I stopped here today for lunch for my wife and I.
The sandwiches were good and service was friendly at the drive thru.
The problem was the way they bagged the order.
The sandwiches on the bottom was fine.
The fries on top would have been ok if they were not just tossed into the bag upside down. When I removed the fries they all spilled out into the bag.

This isn't a big  deal but it was frustrating having to pull them from the bag.

Service is slow at the drive thru. If 2 or more cars are ahead of you, it's  very easy to have to wait 15 minutes to get through.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The lady working tonight was rude and lazy. They still had 30 minutes to closing, there were people inside, and she said she couldn't make a shake because  since they were close to closing she didn't want too lazy to make one. She wasn't even apologetic or anything. HORRIBLE customer service. If that's the case they should put up a sign saying what time you can order certain foods or drinks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the place you go to if you need to stand temporarily. I don't recommend consuming anything here. Nor can I recommend the seating. It's "the classic 90's I've seen some shit" furniture.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of the worst places ever! I got my food and I live not even 4 mins away and my fries were cold & my burger was poorly made , I try to ca and they phone doesn't work.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So the sole reason that BK - and this one in particular - would get 4 stars from me is that they recently started serving cinnabons.  This lovely, amazing invention is one of the favorite ways I have to start my fat-filled American days.

Thanks to BK for carrying this.  And icees too!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ordered 2 large fruit smoothies and not only were they nearly $4 each, they came in super tiny cups. I don't know if the shift manager there forgot that I paid for a large or if the portions are just ridiculously small. 

Also, it was near closing and they were really understaffed, it took me FOREVER to get my drinks. SURE, they make them to order, but the ingredients were as artificial as my breast implants.

To make matters even worse the smoothies tasted terrible. It was like nasty flavored ice. You have FAILED ME, BURGER KING. You should be called BURGER SLAVE because you are not worthy of such a title as "king."<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">food was bland 
the bun on my burger tasted old and hard 
i've had better seriously worst experience
IAM HELLA MAD!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Absolutely the worst Burger King I have ever been to!! Not once has my order been right the first time. You're lucky if you can even get edible food here! If you like apple pie that still has raw crust or a fish sandwich over cooked so much that there's nothing left on the inside, this is the place for you. Management is freaking joke, they should do Fullerton a favor and shut this place down. You're better off going across the street to boardwalk burgers..and I say that even though I've never had boardwalk burgers. Stay away from this place. I only gave it 1 star because yelp is making me, it deserves negative stars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There burgers are okay (i usually like BK burgers, and their cinnamon rolls are terrible (and i normally love BK cinnamon rolls. The dining room is pretty dirty, there was sticky stuff on my table, and restrooms aren't any better. I don't like this location, sometimes i'll still go through the drive-thru just cuz this is very convenient for me, otherwise, i'd never come here. 2-star.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The worst Burger King I have ever been to!  Dad wanted a sausage egg and cheese biscuit but I was too late at almost 11 am.  The girl who was helping me was cold and uncaring  I guess I would say she a bit snobby.   Anyway I had wanted a crispy chicken sandwich and she just made things really different by asking me which one did I want there's too many I had to be specific. I said I wanted a crispy chicken sandwich. She said oh you want the 50 cent one? I said no I want the regular one and she said which one?  OMG!  I said what comes on your original one?  She said lettuce and mayo and I said what kind of chicken? She said fried!  I said ok that's the crispy chicken sandwich!  Finally got it and then went to jack in the box for dad's sausage egg and cheese biscuit where they were amazingly polite and welcoming!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like the new fries!

That's pretty much the only thing which got me in the door at this BK.  The staff treats you like their doing you a favor, the lobby is sort of depressing but if you're hungry and don't have a lot of time there are worse places you could stop for a bite.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I don't know what it is about this location or why I keep expecting things to change. In the drive through every time I get a soda it's flat; Coke, Sprite, what ever. Same with the no pickles caveat I add to my order. It's not that hard to either push the no pickles button or read the no pickles request.  Sad thing is I'll probably go back, next time I'm gunna taste the soda and burger before I pull away. Their fault for not knowing how to do their job, my fault cause I like chicken fries ...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my second time coming here and last time my nuggets were cold and crunchy, this time both my nuggets and my chicken sandwhich were both hard and crunchy as if being left out all day or cooked in old oil. I am never coming here again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went through the drive thru this morning for some breakfast. There was one car ahead of me & it still took over 10 minutes to get my food. When i got home, my food was cold. I called the manager "lito", & he was very nice & apologetic. He told me to come back in before 5pm & i would be able to choose anything i wanted off the menu. I chose a double whopper value meal. 

If you ever have a problem, talk to lito. He is amazing!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm pretty sure Burger King had been advertising the Whopper on the breakfast menu for a bit and that pretty much meant all of their burgers were available in the morning.

Because that is pretty much how I've always eaten at Burger King at breakfast time since I was a teenager, and I am allergic to eggs (which nicks most of their traditional breakfast items.)

I went this morning and tried to order a Double Stacker. I swear I work at the campus so I am here all the time. This is not the first time I've ordered this at this location.

"I'm sorry mam, but we don't have burgers yet."

What? Okay, so I skipped it and drove right on through. At least there wasn't anyone sitting in line in front of me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">consistently gets my order correct.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">BOOO!

Seriously ya'll.
BK needs to put a sign stating: "The burgers are hella tiny".

Stupid me, I keep forgetting, "Not to go anywhere except Jack-inthe-Crack."<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was bad, service was worse, but at least it's cheap and fast. I was hoping that a place so close to CSU Fullerton would be good since the market for tapping all the commuter students is so good. There was one person working both the counter and the drive through - wtf?! Apparently the manager went on break the same time as the other employee leaving the older woman, a reformed meth addict by the look of her teeth, all alone to handle the dining room and drive through. The food was fast but it was the worst mushroom and swiss burger I've had in years. I did use the restrooms and they hadn't been cleaned in a while by the look of the discarded paper towels on the floor.  I won't be back again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to other burger king, but this one deserves a review because im mad :[

so im on a lunch break from work and i couldnt decide where to go, so i thought maybe burger king would be good because it would be quick. 

i had two tacos, small onion rings, and a medium soda. all for only under 5 dollars. the manager was working and he had my food ready and i came to pick it up and checked my order for accuracy. anddddddd you know what. instead of the small onion rings, he gave me small fries. the cashier rang it up wrong i guess and the manager tarted to be rude to me and started yelling at me. telling me that i had ordered fries not onion rings. and he didnt want to change it, because it wasnt what i "ordered"  honestly, i dont see the problem in just changing it because small fries and small onion rings are both on the value menu for one dollar. its the same price! it wasnt necessary for him to be so rude to me and raise his voice. customer service? not good<p>
</p></p>
