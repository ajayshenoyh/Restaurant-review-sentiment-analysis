<p itemprop="description">The Tuesday special "FT Roast Chicken " is horrible. It better be super healthy. 

Still, go-to 24 hour grub for CSUF students.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We've  been going here  for years and the sandwiches have been good and service friendly. Last night we stopped around 8pm. We had a coupon for a free sandwich.

I gave the fellow who was waiting on us my order and asked for the DELUXE sandwich. He ignored me and continued  making the sandwich so I reminded him that I wanted the deluxe sandwich.

When all ingredients were in place I asked for the Sweet Onion sauce and for a little on each half of the sandwich. Again he ignored me and rolled up the sandwich. I just dropped my request and figured it was a futile attempt.

More training needed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There was a customer who kept talking to the woman who was to take my order, so she was distracted. She finally asked me what I wanted. Everything looked fresh here, as compared to where I usually go they have old soggy tomato, this place looks like they keep their stuff fresh which is good because I've gotten food poisoning from subway before. Everything went fine, but the reason that I am giving two stars is because the lady, was making my sandwich and was touching the counter and pushing down the trash in the little container while making my sandwich. That's not sanitary.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I need to say this... I had their "sub of the day" yesterday which was Oven Roasted Chicken Breast. Just to keep details out. I woke up with bad stomach pain and cramping. You can put it together yourself. Sorry. I will NEVER go back to this location again. Keep it clean.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So the food was good. We were not greeted when we arrived... The ladies spoke very quietly so it was hard to hear them. They did make the food quickly .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love 24 stores, the females employees are very nice the males however not so much, they should always be nice when talking to customers. The restaurant is clean which is good but sometimes it gets super busy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The owner had a dog in the store. 

Seriously, I come to this location often. And I've always had a pleasant enough experience. But today my husband and I were there and the owner had a dog in the store! He was working on the soda machine and then walked back and forth on the employee side of the ingredients all while carrying his little Pomeranian-type dog. I'm pretty reasonable and don't complain over honest mistakes... But this was completely intentional. The owner obviously did not think there was anything wrong with having a dog all over the restaurant. 

Staff was great. But the owner was a jerk, yelling at them and demanding, not asking them for things. 
 
I feel bad for the staff, and I seriously hope that this owner learns to take food safety more seriously.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like this subway! And I love how it's open 24 hours! I also like how they labeled the calories big and clear! 

However, the service is ok. 

I had a young girl with brown/black hair make my sandwich... I was beyond annoyed!!! I would pick a topping, and she would put such a little amount! And ask "anything else" about 15 times!  ( put the right amount, so you don't have to keep asking the same question)

It's an ok place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just went to this subway tonight with my boyfriend and first of all the service was terrible and second the sandwiches were awful. When we got there the two girls were talking to each other in the back.. Taking their dear sweet time. Once the girl finally came to take our order she seemed extreme distracted. The phone rang and she looked at the phone in almost a panicked way. My boyfriend even told her that she can answer the phone if she wants and she said no but then two seconds later took the phone call. Anyways, we left and went home to eat and to be honest they were the worst sandwiches I have ever had at subway. We basically threw them out. 

I love subway and I promote subway so much and I was extremely disappointed at my visit<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's Subway. Parking can be a pain during the day, but it's very convenient for being open 24 hours! They have one of those fountain machines with a touchscreen monitor and tons of drink choices. If you dine in, its not the quietest of places to eat. They have a huge loud fan at the door that activates when someone comes in or out of the restaurant. Avoid going here on Tuesday or Thursday late night, because there's a particular dance team that likes to come in after their practice, making the wait super long. And they're annoyingly loud. Blame Faith. Their service is hit or miss. Some workers are very generous and others can be very uptight. Just depends. It's Subway.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is about as inconsistent as it gets with their service. I dont understand how or why its so inconsistent. I have had other people tell me the same exact thing. The quality of the sandwich is put into the hand of these guys, and some make a mediocre sandwich, others a fantastic sub, and the majority just ruin it. 

Read the other reviews alot of them will mention the same thing. I keep going here since its down the block from CSUF but seriously the inconsistency made me stop going for well over a month. On the upside the soda machine makes up for some of the lack of consistency.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a pretty great little Subway. Located in a strip mall close to a 99 Cent store on the Southeast corner of State College and Chapman, it's the ideal place for the CSUF crowd, but it never seems to get that busy regardless of what time I'm there.

Polite staff - and they work quickly to move the line if there is one. Aside from all of that - the greatest soda machine that ever lived lives here :) Those that know me know what a diet Coke junkie I am - it's my biggest vice! But to see diet Coke, and to be able to customize it any way I want is just awesome.

On top of everything else. they are open 24/7. There's nothing like the 3am sammich run :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I know subways are basically all the same... but omg I got a sandwich today and they made it perfectly. Often times you get a big mess of condiments and vegetables on your paper at the end. This time It was different. I wish I got the guys name (MID20'S) Hispanic man, he made it perfect. Nothing fell out everything was evenly displaced in my sandwich. Got avacado and bacon in every bite thanks to how this guy made it.  Delicious .<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My friends and I come here after a gym session at the Student Recreation Center to avoid the guilt of eating fast food after running our asses off. Miss Vickie's jalepeno chips ARE the bizznizz AND the Peach Fanta from their awesome soda machine! 

This month is februANY. I shouted that as we walked towards Subway and my friends thought I was crazy. Any subway sandwich footlong is $5 but their premium and supreme sandwiches are about a few dollars more ($6-$7). During our trip, we didn't have any trouble with the employees so that's always a good thing because customer service is the most important thing to me. We did encounter a bum on the way in and out of the store though but he wasn't any trouble to us. 

This particular subway is 24 hours! Yay to late night studying.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the typical subway I go to, usually once a week or so. Usually its nothing special. Just a normal good ol' subway. But last night I went after class and had the top notch employee, Josue, make my sandwich. He was on it with every request I made. Usually when you ask for extra anything, the bland employees will respond with "its going to cost extra", then they half-ass the extra toppings. Josue was not like that. Instead, he verified how much extra I wanted, provided the perfect amount, and did it with an outgoing attitude. While I may be reading into a subway meal too much, I must say it made the difference. Best meatball sub I have ever had. Normally I get the chicken/bacon/ranch, but I was in the mood for something different. The line was kinda long, but the employees kept their cool, which is always a good thing. No one likes to feel rushed, and I certainly didn't feel rushed, which was good.

The location is pretty clean, has a great fountain drink dispenser, and all the toppings/chips/etc that customers need. Aside from Josue, the rest of the employees are pretty cool. Quiet and not as talkative, but they keep the line moving and get the job done. Due to its convenience, good prices, and decent service - Ill keep this location as my "go-to" subway.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I used to eat here all the time then stopped because I had a couple of bad experiences but recently decided to give them another try and I'm glad I did!  I stopped-in at around 8PM on a Tuesday and was pleasntly surprised to find the bread (and cookies!) to be fresh.  Must be because their open 24hrs but it was nice to be able to get a sandwich with actual fresh ingredients at that time of night when most Subway's are serving stale bread.

I'm still not a fan of the 101 flavor soda machine (every time I use it my soda always seems to have a lingering taste of whatever the person before me had).  Despite that I'll be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">2 reasons for 5 star: awesome soda machine and open 24 hours.

Service is inconsistent here... I feel like every time I come in (3x a week minimum) there's new staff. I've been the only customer and it took 10 minutes AND have been 1 of 10 customers and it took 10 minutes - that's inconsistency at its finest.

I've never had an issue with cleanliness or freshness although one guy has been consistently aloof and callous in making my sandwich... not enough for me to write off the place though, I'm just direct in what I want when dealing with him. I'm usually friendly and polite to whoever's making my sandwich (they do have control of my food!) and will often strike up a conversation if they're not too busy... I've had some very nice chats with some of the employees - very nice people. 

It's Subway - not much to write home about.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Literally stood in line for an hour with only 4 people in front of me. Went to Subway around 7pm on Sunday Aug 2nd. There were two girls working and they had ZERO sense of urgency. They were working so slowly and at one point one of the girls stopped making  sandwiches and the othe other girl was teaching her how to make jalapeño cheese bread. Very annoyed with that. I ordered a veggie patty sandwhich and added guacamole.When i got home and ate my sandwhich my mouth is instantly on fire. The gucamole is the spicest gucamole I have ever had, and now have a wasted other half of sandwhich because its too hot to eat. Only came here because a friend of mine gave me a gift card. Never coming to this location again. Poor service, and killer guacamole. NO THANK YOU !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Parking lot and the inside of this Subway is always packed during lunch time. I would say the times that I have been here they were quick. But the only thing I would say I just don't really enjoy is the bread that they use. It just doesn't taste good.

Also all the veggies come out of plastic bags which makes me wonder is it really fresh? Yes Subway seems healthier then going to Mc Donalds of course. Subway is quick, and almost like fast food. 

The pricing though  seems quite high for me and I would rather pay a few more dollars to get something a lot better.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">SKIIIIIIIPPPPP. Came here with my boyfriend and the employees were a j o k e. All of the vegetables were mixed in other compartments; spinach in the red peppers, olives in the jalepenos, etc! It was so bad, I got out my camera to take a picture and the employees FREAKED! Lol do your job right and you shouldn't need to worry about cross-contamination pics popping up on yelp. They're lucky that visit was months ago and I had to delete the pics to make room for pics on my trip in Japan. I thoroughly regret not posting immediately so the health department would have some solid proof of the disgusting signs of laziness at this specific location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am writing this because I feel like we received horrible customer service this evening. We had two people assisting with our sandwiches. A man named Dave and a short woman whose name I don't remember. We ordered the new BBQ Oven Roasted Chicken Melt and Dave did not put BBQ sauce on them prior to toasting the sandwiches. I had to ask for the BBQ sauce on the sandwich and was looked at weird when I made the request. The woman assisting me with the vegetables seemed annoyed with my request for both BBQ and spicy Mustard because they were on the other side of the service station. She kept quickly moving my sandwich down the line and I felt like she was very impatient. My boyfriend also received bad customer service during the process and decided to just not ask for the BBQ sauce because he didn't want to have it on his sandwich cold. 

The two employees that were working at the store this evening were NOT customer service oriented and really made the entire experience awkward. Usually I get great customer service from this store. I have been a customer of this location for many years and I appreciate that it is open 24 hours a day. However, the service I received this evening and the lack luster quality of the sandwich has left a negative experience on my mind. I have not eaten at Subway for several months because the costs keep rising and the quality isn't improving.

As of now, I do not plan on EVER returning to this Subway location because I do not appreciate feeling like I am inconveniencing someone for doing their job!!  I just wanted to bring this situation to your attention so that you can provide proper training to your employees. I have worked in the customer service and hospitality industry for 10 years and the service I received this evening really was horrendous.  Instead of being treated as "Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen" I felt I was treated as a nuisance because I wanted BBQ sauce on my BBQ Oven Roasted Chicken Melt. 

I have already sent this complaint into Subway via their customer service form: http://www.subway.com/ContactUs/frmCustomerService.aspx. I just want to warn other patrons to consider a different location before spending your hard earned money!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They are quite a few Subways within this area.  I've been here only one time and that was it.  And reason why I don't patronize this  location is simple:  I don't want to be cheated when it comes to pay for my order.  I'm not gullible and I do look at my receipt.  And wouldn't be a bit surprise if this character doesn't work here any more.  He was bad for business; plain and simple.  Hopefully, they got rid on him.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sometimes I think that I am the biggest moron alive.  I can't believe that I still get fascinated by anything that has a touch screen.  But again, I succumb.  This time it is to a Coke machine that dispenses a billion different combinations of soda.  I'm not a big Subway fan but I'll just go there to get a drink.  The new machine they have is black and Coke Zero themed.  Made me want to get a sparkling Dasani with peach syrup.  What have I become? Peach soda? Now I know what the Jetsons felt like.  If they ever come up with touch screen porn, it's GAME OVER for me.

This location is open 24 hours.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There isn't much to the good old subway sandwich shop. And really the sandwiches are just that sandwiches. But this location always seems to be much better both in consistency in the construction of the sandwich and in cleanliness. The staff is helpful and kind always ready to help with a smile and emanating the most evident customer service attitude I think I have ever witnessed in a sub way, Quiznos, blimpie, or togos when they were around more. The cheese steak wasn't the best I have ever had. But well worth adding to the four star rating I am bestowing upon this location. Great job ladies if subway.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The future has arrived. It's right here in Fullerton. Screw your iPhones and your jet-packs, the 100 drink Coke machine at this Subway is the future. 

Holy shit. This thing is amazing. You know how you always want Diet Mr Pibb, or perhaps even Sprite Zero with a splash of peach...but nothing is ever there to fulfill those cravings? Well, enter crazy Coke machine of the future at Subway. You can add flavors to just about anything, and pick from about a bajillion drinks...and it all comes out of one fountain. There's really no other way to put this...It's Fucking Amazing. 

Plus, come on...this Subway is open 24 hours! 24 hours of Subway, and crazy Coke drinks. I'm sooo there. Like everyday. I'll be in my Delorean.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location is open 24 hours, which is nice when I get home at 11 and nothing but fast food is open.  Subway is always hit and miss for me. It's 50/50 with the sandwich artists making my sandwich, if I like the way they made it when I get home.  However, I have never had a problem with the quality of food here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The only reason I'll visit this subway is when nothing else is open. It is 24 hrs, & that is the only plus.

The owner is so rude. He'll yell at his employees in front of everyone. He is also very sloppy & tight. Putting the very minimum amount of lettuce & veggies possible, he yells at other employees who put the normal amount. He also slaps the ingrediens on like he's trying to lose customers.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The chick here did not mess around with my veggie delight. I definitely got my money worth here. Usually most sandwich artists skimp on my veggie delights as if I am robbing their own personal gardens of lettuce, spinach and other fixins' but not this girl. Which by the way totally blows my mind because i am not even ordering meat, I am their least expensive customer with barely any overhead and should be rewarded with extra banana peppers and olives. 

But back to my favorite chick, she deserves sandwich artist of the year, she was like the Van Gough of Veggie Delights. 

i do love the futuristic soda machine but I am sure that touch screen has some serious bacteria on that shit. 

Wash your paws before you dig in and you should be good to go.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like that this Subway is 24/7. The December customer appreciation month with $2 6"  subs was a pretty good promotion for Meatball or Cold Cut. This Subway is pretty standard with high turnover. You go in, order, and you are on your way. The staff is not bad, not jerks or anything. There is usually always people eating inside and the soda fountain is pretty futuristic! Also, there is parking everywhere, you may just have to park a little bit further down the lot and walk...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">HORRIBLE service and they HAVE COCKROACHES.  I used to come here a lot until they got new management.  Now I refuse to ever come again.  Everyone here is rude and disrespectful to customers.  Furthermore, the furniture looks nice and all but in actuality this store is extremely unsanitary.  Here are some of my experiences at this store (these all happened within the last month and with different employees each time):

1.) I saw a huge cockroach coming from the back.  I told one of the supervisors and she said "it must have come from outside."  It did not come from outside.

2.) I see one of the workers take off their gloves (turning it inside out in the process), and put it on the counter.  He comes back and puts it back on (so now the inside has become the outside).  I kindly ask him to change gloves because he already used that one and he says "no I didn't."  Um........ yeah you did dipshit.

3.) I got honey mustard sauce (my usual) on one of my sandwiches and it tasted extremely sour.  I come back to the cashier and tell her I think the honey mustard is expired and that it tastes very sour.  She says "that's how honey mustard is supposed to taste" with a look on her face like I'm an idiot.  We argue for an unnecessary 2 minutes until she made me a new one without the sauce.  

4.) My roommate and I order together and paid together to get the 2 for $10 deal.  We hand the cashier $5 in cash and a credit card, and told him "put the rest on the card."  He rings up the credit card and with a condescending attitude asks us "sir, this doesn't make any sense, why did you give me $5 cash and a credit card?"  We tell him we want to pay $5 in cash and the rest on the card.  He has a confused look on his face and starts getting angry, repeating that it doesn't make any sense and how he is unable to do that.  After 60 seconds of this dumbass's bullshit, we decided to let it go and leave.


Again, this all happened within the last month.  I have more horror stories from this place but I'll just leave it at that.  My advice: don't come here ever. Go to the one on yorba linda and kraemer, they are much nicer and they don't have cockroaches.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm not kidding... I only went to this subway to see the funky soda machine. I may have low standards. I had cherry coke zero!
My sandwich was ok. Subway is cool for actually having a veggie patty instead of just giving you some limp lettuce with vingegar and calling it a sammich. Not a vegan anymore by a long shot, but their white bread is actually safe everywhere in the country. Go subway.
But did I mention I got cherry coke zero! From the soda machine from the near future! I would have hugged it if there wasn't a cute CSUF guy waiting to get his caffeine fix behind me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">UGH IM STARTING TO HATE THIS SUBWAY

i come here religiously, like every single day. i like this subway because they give you 4 pieces of cheese on the veggie instead of 2 pieces. i dont go to any other subway because of this. every so often i'll get a new person or a person who transferred from another subway and i already know they aren't going to know what the hell theyre doing. most of the time theyll give me two pieces, ill tell them its supposed to be four, theyll say no, ill say ask someone else, they will, then the other more educated person will say "its 4 on the veggie"

WELL TONIIIIIGGGHHHTTT i did that, but he asked ANOTHER new guy and they both said "yeah its two pieces" and i said no it's not you guys need to ask someone whos not new, and they wouldnt ask someone else and stuck by it and only gave me two pieces. 

i know i sound crazy, but its not the cheese, its the fact that these morons think they're right and IM RIGHT. goddddddddddd

i hope the owner realizes this and schools these morons on the cheese amount in a veggie sandwhich!!!! AHHHHHHHHH<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Open 24 hours and cool soda machine but service isnt that great sometimes rude. Hard to find parking close by sometimes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Heather P. is a turd!  The epitome of American consumerism at it's absolute worst, I tell you.

Anyway, this place is amazing.  First off, it's open 24hrs a day. I know, crazy right?  THey have the nicest people working there, D.H. must have a personality disorder or sssssomething (Serpantor hiss.)

The real star of this place is the soda machine.  A computerized soda machine serving up so many varieties of soda that I literally effing cried.  Peach Sprite anyone?  Did YOU know they made that?  Probably an experimental product sold to the people of the Appalachia region, brought to Southern California for our betterment.  I'm not kidding.  I love the soda machine and the people and a sandwich at any hour my stomach desires.  4am?  No problem, get some meatball sammich, fatty.  2am?  Done with the other barflies and club kids, no problem, like an oasis or a good neighbor, it's always there!

Subway, beating you in the face with a fresh meaty sandwich any time of the day or night!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hey, this one's open 24 hours!  It's reasonably close to some CSUF apartment complexes, so come right on by if you get hungry.  I've been a post-midnight customer here twice, and I thought the sandwiches were great.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">BOOOO! I dont care if there SEEMS to be a lunch rush and youre in fast forward mode. Yes I want an all veggie sandwich, no I dont want you to start flopping shit on it until I ask for it! Dont rush me, dont ask me for ingredients that I dont want, and dont answer your pink Razr while cashiering me!

Cool soda machine though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Subway is awesome.  The reason why you ask...well not only is it because of the super cool digital, LCD screens soda machine BUT it mainly rocks because of the hours of endless people watching entertainment it can provide.  Over 75% of the people at this machine couldn't even figure out how to work the damn thing! Absolutely HILARIOUS!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">All I have to say is that some of the best workers are at this store. My sandwich always comes out perfect, and the employees are always friendly. Especially Estefania, Chris, Desiree, Roksana, And Cinthia.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">24 hour. Haven't had any complaints. My sandwich has always looked and tasted good. They also have a better selection of ingredients than others.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The only reason I go here is because it is the closest subway to CSUF but if it weren't for that, I would never go here.. ever. First of all, the employees are so rude. This morning, I went in to get a 6'' sub and asked for bacon. The male employee that seems to always be working put two small pieces of bacon that didn't even cover the length of the bread.. 1/3 of my sandwich was literally just wheat bread and veggies. He proceeded to toast it and asked me what vegetables and sauce I wanted then it was time to pay. He didn't even ask me if I wanted anything else, gave me the price, rung me up, and handed me back my card. I didn't even get a thank you from him. He just went into the back and left. I waited for him to come back because I needed a napkin and a woman named Griselda comes out and says, "What do you want?" .... Excuse me? Did she really just say that to me. Well if you're serious about asking me that question, what I REALLY want is for you and your employees to learn some manners... and a few pieces of napkins for my sandwich.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Service was curt and to the point, but my sandwich was goddamn mindblowing. Everything is super fresh and delicious. They don't skimp out on ingredients either. AND it's open 24-7 which is awesome. I'll definitely be coming back to this location...OFTEN.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Heather P. is right, came here during lunch today and the workers rushed through my sandwich adding all this crap without asking me. 

The girl handling the bread and meat wasn't bad, but the guy working on the condiments only asked what veges I wanted - which I replied that I wanted everything but pickles, and before I knew it he threw on ranch without even asking me (I did not want ranch with my buffalo chicken sandwich), and by the time I said I don't want ranch it was already on there so I was like ok I guess I can deal with ranch, but then he threw on oil and vinegar in one quick motion and I got pretty pissed cause I didn't want any of that, and by the time I started protesting he was starting to FUCKING ADD SALT AND PEPPER on my sandwich. If it wasn't for the fact that I was really hungry and there were a number of people still waiting in line I would have asked for a new sandwich or walked out, and now that I'm typing this after eating 1/2 the sandwich I'm really regretting not doing so cause it tastes like shit with the salt/pepper/ranch/oil/vinegar on an already 2,500 mg of sodium sandwich.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">One of my worst Subway experiences. They messed up all the sandwiches, which were not made well either. They didn't bother to cut the foot longs in half.  When we got them home to eat, they didn't taste very good either.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I go to this subway several nights a week(it's one of the few places open late enough) and I have no complaints. The food is good and the employees are friendly. I would even go so far as to call the employees awesome, they joke around and make my admittedly difficult sandwiches perfect.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">this place is a joke. the indian guy who works there is a dick and thinks he is intimidating so instead of complaining and asking what his problem is, i gave the same attitude back. if he didn't understand what i said, he would rudely say "HUH?" as if i were the one who wasn't born in the US with an accent. he should probably practice speaking himself, before he rudely asks "HUH?"

not to mention the face he made when i grabbed the change out of his hand, was priceless. he half-assed my sandwich (sloppy, falling apart) but in the end, i can careless since he is playing the role of my girlfriend<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The people that work there are extremely rude and disrespectful. They rush you by not letting you finish what you have to say when you placing your order, and cut you off when you are telling them how you want your sandwich. The tone of voice they use seems to rub people the wrong way, its like their talking down to you. In addition they don't suggest double meat on your sandwich. They tell you that is what you getting, "You want double meat its better!" then they just flop the meat on. I had to tell the dude, "Hey I didn't order double meat, and I didn't want mayo." They just start throwing stuff on your sandwich prior to asking or listening to you answer. I had been there a few times and witnessed their poor attitudes and disrespect of customers, but when it hap pend to me I quit going. They are all rude especially the dude with tattoos and the dark complected middle Eastern guy with spiked black hair. Anyhow subways are on every corner it seems so if you can help pass this one by and go to another.  In conclussion the dude with spiked hair tried to charge me extra for cheese and heating up the sandwich. But what ever.<p>
</p></p>
