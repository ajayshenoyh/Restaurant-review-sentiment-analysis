<p itemprop="description">First off, I've been coming to this Chipotle for a while now and my visits are always pleasant. I live right across the street from this location.

Whenever I come to this location, I'm normally in a great mood. 

Tonight, I am an emotional wreck and am dealing with a lot of personal issues so I decide to cancel my plans and go to Chipotle alone to clear my mind. I come in and order my food and I can't help but to notice I was so cheered up by the staff who actually went above and beyond for me. 

Not only was I sad/hungry/alone, I was so much more happier when I sat down to eat my food. 

My plan after Chipotle was to go sit in Starbucks for an hour or two but I found it to be very welcoming and comfortable staying in chipotle. 

Just when you want to break down and cry,
someone is there to make you smile and remind you that life goes on. I am going to sleep so good tonight knowing that there are these kind of people out there. Thank you so much.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Horrible experience here today!! I got a bowl from here, just got home and writing this review before I even eat because I'm so annoyed. But I asked for veggies, guy says they're out, so I ask the eta on getting more. His response was there were no more and no eta.....they were on the grill behind him. Then when I was waiting to pay it took the cashier, literally, 5 minutes to come to the register.  As I'm paying the veggies that were cooking were placed on the line.  

Went to get my soda after this and the Sprite was not working, root beer wasn't working so I go for my third choice pibb xtra but that wasn't working. I try coke next and it's nothing but soda water. Thankfully there was a coke on the other side that was working, but that left the choices as 1 coke, Coke Zero, and lemonade; assuming the other two were even working correctly.  This is the closest chipotle to me, but now I will be going further to enjoy a chipotle that has its act together.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">After so many consecutively getting bad servicr I've decided to put down a review. The cashier is always running around somewhere else and most of the employees have a "get out of my face" attitude.

2 stars because it's still a Chipotle and sofritas are always good but employees are glum at best and very intrusive when they're on break.

I understand it can get busy but so does Disneyland.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm to a point where this is the last time I go to this shit establishment. I literally could count the pieces of chicken on one hand that they gave me on my bowl, sorry for trusting you while I was on my phone.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">First of all that place is dirty as hell. There was not one table that did not have food on it. Second of all the food was tasteless. I'm pretty that the meat was undercooked because I got sick from it. Do not recommend at all<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Went to grab a salad around 9pm last night. Told the associate that i wanted a salad and she told me that they ran out of lettuce.  I tried not to be a difficult customer  so i simply switched it up to a burrito bowl.  As I was going through the line i realized that they were running out of everything therefore skimping out on portions. I've  worked in costumer service before so I tried not to be difficult. I simply paid and took my food home. As I was eating my dinner, I realized the rice and chicken was undercooked. Totally could have gotten sick from my meal. Trashed the entire thing after 2 bites.  Safe to say that I'm never coming back here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">to be honest, i have no idea what the crazy hype about this place was. I believe its average or a little above average at most. i always get the burrito bowl, and i do have to commend them because in a way, you get to pick what you eat and we all have that inner child side of us that loves to pick. prices are decent, i believe everything is still around or under 10 so thats a bonus, a quick meal for under 10. this location is pretty big and clean, another bonus if you're planning to sit and eat there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When I have more than 2 orders I'll use the app to order our meals.. tell me why when I come at the allotted time and it is never ready, they tell me that they will start on the order. Well, it should be ready by the time I arrive. So of course I have no choice but to wait for it wouldn't be a big deal but I have 30 minutes for my lunch and waiting for the meal shortens my time to eat and everyone knows chipotle never refrigerates well, (taste like crap) after you eat it from the fridge... so I never get to finish my bowl or burrito and there's 10 bucks down the drain. IF YOU HAVE THE TIME STATING IT WILL BE READY. THEN IT SHOULD BE READY. 10-15 minutes is understandable. But waiting 25 minutes for 3 burritos is not.   The EMPLOYEE turnover at this chipotle is so high, I can come every week and there will be new staff. Which means they're not happy to work there, in return they don't care about customer.  GET IT TOGETHER PEOPLE.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is generally great. They pump it out fast for CSUF lunchtime rush. Its hard to write a fair review since the staff really make your experience and it changes frequently. Overall I've had decent or great staff, but there are more rare occasions when I get a poor employee or the food isn't prepared as well. 

I'm giving it 4 stars because overall I've had good experiences and the taste of Chipotle is amazing. This place usually hits the spot. Love it, despite a few bad experiences.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I use to really love Chipotle but the quality has gone down. So I guess they using iceberg lettuce instead of romaine. 

I decided to change it up and order the steak. It was beyond chewy and little to no flavor. 

The only thing that still taste good is the chips.

More than like never coming back. At least not until the quality comes back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Never thought I would see a bad Chipotle, but reviews don't lie. I just threw away my 3/4 full chicken bowl.  The rice is not fully cooked, and you can actually see where the old cilantro rice was mixed in with new fresh cilantro.  Guacamole tasted old, corn wasn't properly made.  I spit out multiple pieces of my bowl due to hard corn that felt like plastic and HARD uncooked rice.  I don't think I've had such a bad experience like this before. This is unacceptable<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Okay, so I decided to come in for lunch because I've been craving a veggie bowl. 

The first person I saw, had a miserable look on her face. She looked so unhappy. I get it, it was a peak hour but I don't want to be helped by someone who looks like they are hating life. I was also disappointed because she was barely serving me any rice, beans or even veggies. I mean it's a veggie bowl I should have more than a few pieces of veggies. This was a problem not only with me but with others ahead of me. They were all asking for more rice, beans as well as veggies. I mean I'm paying for all of this so don't skimp me ya know? And she was also getting irritated with people asking her for more. I mean if you would serve the correct amount you wouldn't have this issue. 

Everyone behind the counter didn't have a smile on their face nobody except for the cashier! She was extremely nice and greeted me with a genuine smile. So I checked out and was good. I went back to grab some lemons, and it was a different cashier. She was in the middle of a transaction, so I asked if she could grab me some lemons when she had the chance. She didn't even look at me and was like give me a second. Fine I get it your busy. So she finally grabs me what I asked, and only gives me one and tells me that they are cutting up more.

So my overall experience today was not the greatest. I'm glad I had at least one good interaction. But my bowl, was not up to par. Let's hope I don't have this experience again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">During the summer, you can totally come here.

During any other time, you are asking to get yourself killed with the amount of traffic coming from the colleges/schools nearby.

Food is still good, though!  You just have to battle other human beings to just 1) get on the correct street, 2) find a parking space, 3) get in line, 4) get out of line, 5) get out of the parking lot, 6) get out into the correct street.

Other than the area making you want to build a transporter, Chipotle is still good!  The service can sometimes be a little testy (can't blame them with the student clientele), but the place definitely fulfills my Chipotle cravings.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have frequented this Chipotle for a long time for its location.Always order 4 salads with different items in it. Always got a smirk from the server, and was always rushed so I always get them wrong. Tonight for the first time I was treated nicely. I wish all of them there are like Danielle. Finally I got my orders right...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The guy next to a register was rude. I accidentally hit hit tip tin and he accused me of stealing out  of his jar. So rude, gave me attitude and I think I'll take a longer drive to Brea next time. Not a fan of their service and don't want to come back. I'll be emailing corporate too. You don't accuse people of stealing and don't go saying its your tip jar. It's everyone's who works there you jerk.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Horrible service tonight - rudely sarcastic staff, tried overcharging me, forgot to give me all of my meal..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Horrible! Portions are tiny and they get mad when you ask for extra... By extra I mean the other half that was supposed to be on the original serving of the scoop. I got a total of three slices of peppers on my grilled veggies, man I'm definitely gonna be full after this bowl ..... The lemons are behind the counter and they ask you how many you want. By how many they mean slices. One slice per container! 
Waste of money on this chipotle!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Because I'm a vegan, I typically eat at Chipotle about five times a week -  because in addition to your food, I've enjoyed your usually high level of customer service. Until today. Because the onions in your fajitas seriously upset my stomach, I always request "peppers only."  In scores of Chipotle stores, with hundreds of servers, my request has always been accommodated. Until today, when the server refused my request, and checking with the "day manager," Lourdes Sarida, was told not to hinor my request. While I will never come to this Chipotle again, in order for others who may have similar requests that can be accommodated easily - in about 30 seconds, I'd urge Chipotle Corporate to do some additional "customer service training" with both the store's manager, Jesus Anorve, and Lourdes Sarida so they can pass on a better customer service attitude to ALL of their employees.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Got here at 10:30am for a hangover burrito. Currently is 10:39 and has NOT opened. Wtf right? There's a crowd out here Chipotle. Do your job.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Chipotle. I've been eating at various locations since 2009. This one happens to be the closest to my apartment. I go to Cal state Fullerton. The food is usually pretty solid. The chips are under cooked half the time which is upsetting because that's half the reason I go there. I hear the hard and chewy chips are a result of trying to make too many in a single batch. Anyways,  the chips I can handle and the food is usually flavored pretty well, the service is just awkward sometimes. The workers like to talk to each other more about their personal lives rather than talk to the guest. I've been in multiple times and you can feel the tension in the air between the cashier and those on the lines... Awkward. Very awkward.It's even worse that the manager seems to Be in on the drama too because his attitude is always poor as well.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food at Chipotle is pretty good, and a much healthier alternative to some of the other fast food choices in the area. The customer service is decent, but I've noticed this place is usually always understaffed. I rarely ever see anyone working the dining room area, so there is usually no one to maintain the cleanliness of that area. As a result, the tables are usually somewhat messy given that a lot of people don't clean up after themselves. Although if you don't mind cleaning up after the person before you, then this probably won't bother you much. Overall, Chipotle gets my recommendation for their healthy and tasty menu options.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Probably because of the location, it being next to CSUF, this Chipotle gets really busy where the line to order looks like the DMV or Disneyland. With this in mind, you would think their crew would consist of more than three employees putting your burrito/bowl/etc together to expedite the process and cut the line short... But no. Not only is the service slow, most of the employees don't even smile or anything. Yall need to learn Customer Service 101. Yes this place gets really busy, but it wouldn't hurt to smile or respond when you're greeted-- so rude!

Also, they're stingy with portions and not consistent. You'd see the person in front of you order same type of protein and get a bigger scoop than yours. And no, they didn't order extra meat. C'mon now, get your shit together, Chipotle. 

Lastly, I ordered guacamole on the side and found paper in it! The material seemed/felt like the little soufflé cups that you put ketchup in at most fastfood places.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">[LOCATION]
Big store, it was really clean and there were a lot of seating options. Don't forget to pack a sweater though 'cause it could get chilly in there!

[STAFF]
They were friendly enough, customer service wasn't too out of this world but it wasn't bad either.

[FOOD]
Delicious, as always. The food is always fresh tasting and piping hot. The only downside is that some of the portions could get a little skimpy, but I'm not one to complain too much about that. It's still a lot of food overall, and I think it's worth the money.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like chipotle but I'm kinda peeved because I nearly are a large piece of avocado skin that I found in my guac. Pay attention to your food people it's your job. The people were nice though and there was a really hot worker so 5 stars 10/10 will come back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is possibly the worst chipotle I've ever been to. 

They were stingy with every single item I wanted on my salad, even the corn! I saw her take a (small) scoop then put half of it back! The people assembling were not paying attention and just wanted to hurry the line up but that only slows them down because they have to go back to add something. The poor guy behind me had tried to get the girls attention at least 
 five times to add something to his burrito and I had to also interrupt because they skipped over items I wanted. I asked for green and red sauce on the side, at all other locations that's not a problem, but here, you'd think I asked for extra food for free! 

I usually can never finish a salad, the portion was so small I was able to finish it. Even though this is considered the closest location to me I will drive out of my way to another one, never again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The girl who was ringing us up gave us a bag of soggy chips. I asked 2 more times for a fresh bag and they were soggy as well. She also put back the chips that i had felt with my hands back on the shelf. Finally just asked for a refund. One of the cooks  (purple plugs, very nice) brought us out another complimentary bag of chips, still soggy, but thank you for the kind gesture!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awesome customer service! Had to wait about 8-10 minutes for veggies. While I was waiting, they offered me a fountain drink. I was assuming it was free but would have paid for it without a problem. Then when I got to the register, they comped my entire meal. Totally not necessary but super appreciated! Thank you Chipotle staff! You rock!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Long ass lines! 

The only thing good here is the Guac! I come here when one of my older kids is craving Chipotle! Yes I'll eat it but you won't find me saying "I am really craving Chipotle right now" nope, NEVA! 

The chips and guacamole are delicious,  I'll give them that! The portions are also huge but that's it! The food needs flavor, they need to add some spices! Now they have some tofu concoction for vegetarians... I haven't tried it so I can't give my opinion on that! 

I like to get my burrito in a bowl,  with my flour tortilla on the side (I like to eat it later with butter) but they do get skimpy on the lettuce! The lettuce container had about five slivers of sliced lettuce and the girl helping me put it on my bowl! She didn't even offer to get more lettuce! She just pushed my bowl on down the line! 

I just can't get over how people are in love with Chipotle, my kids included! I cannot say I will never be back because I will. I just don't see what the hoopla is over a cold burrito! 

THREE STARS!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Yup 1 star... I visit chipotle all the time. Even more so with the current Chiptopia rewards program. However, today's visit rewarded me with the most bland and tasteless chicken I've ever had at Chipotle. I even tried splitting my burrito bowl into 2 meals and saved the 2nd half for later thinking maybe my tastebuds were off. Not the case. So bad I decided to grill some chicken when I got home. Step your seasoning game up!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This has to be one of the most dissapointing experiences i have ever had in a Chipotle. The Guacamole had no flavor. I have been here many times before and it has never been like this. I thibk it ia the crew they have working tonight because the food taste horrible and the place ia filthy. Pretty bad!!! Making the chain look bad!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is probably the worst chipotle I've gone to. Their turnover sucks here. The tables are always dirty with food on it still. Also I've noticed lately that their food tastes more salty. I don't know if they did something new to the beans but it tastes like it's loaded with sodium. Their fajitas have a chlorine flavor to it. The chicken either tastes burnt or chewy with gristle. 

Also, I was thirsty and needed more iced tea but it seems like that's always low and they don't restock it. One of the servers asks me if I need anything. I asked her about the iced tea and if they were going to bring in a new batch. I see her tell the cashier and they just giggle but nothing gets solved. The server never gave me an answer so I just left and threw my cup away. Why ask me if I need anything if you're not going to come through?

I only go here because it's the only nearest chipotle by CSUF and it's the only place that's considered healthy and it's fast. 

I keep thinking "maybe it's a bad day for them," but it can't possibly be like this almost every time...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awful, tacos have barely any meat, lettuce or cheese. Food is cold, won't be back again. No wonder this location has such a low rating. Two thumbs down.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not giving it much thought that the location right at the college campus might be a give away for a full, noisy and messy location with long lines, I came here for a quick lunch.
All of the things above are true, yes, but the staff was pretty good at handling the line.
I went with the veggie bowl, love the free guac and all of their salsas.
If you load it up, its plenty to have leftovers for later, $8 for that is more than fair.
Was a bit cold and I know there are  better things to eat in the area, but filled the need in a rush last week.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this location specially an associate that greets me with a happy, honest smile no matter how busy or how late they are.  Her name is Jasmin.  She is the best associate.  Her smile and her. Ordeal and honest greeting is wonderful to get.  Sometimes when I get there and I am so tired just to see her and greet me with so much enthusiasm. Is uplifting and contagious.  I am an older woman with currently lots of troubles but Jasmin  has the power to make me feel good about myself and I leave your establish,ent with more energy. And well the food is wonderful too.  This place would not be the same without her.
Thank you Jasmin. You rock!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This chipotle sucks. Most the workers look and act like they hate everything and everyone. You feel bad asking for anything because they respond by acting like you're asking them for the world. Before the cashier scanned my free chipotle card, I asked the older lady, who takes the prepared order and hands it to the cashier, if I could get guacamole... The cashier scanned it in the middle of my question and so the lady proceeded to say, "yes, but it's too late." Huh? Too late to ask one of the workers to scoop some guacamole? She addressed the issue by telling me "next time" and moving on to the next order...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Never go to this Chipotle, they are under staffed, so the line took boarderline half an hour, and when you do get up to the line, they give you 4 grains of rice (an extremely small amount of toppings!) Go to Brea!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best chipotle spot SoCal!! No lies  they hook you up really well and take care of you. Best chipotle experience! No lies, highly recommend<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Steak = "Knuckle-meat?" 

The steak was actually steak five years ago instead of chewy reject meat, wtf happened? They used to have a good "Hot" salsa. But someone else picked it up for me since we used a gift card. They put this terrible "Chipotle" salsa on it. Tasted like...anyways, it made the knuckle-meat the highlight of this meal.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You would think after the food poisoning issue...the chain would take every precaution to isure food safety....however...the meat was cold...not good....beans and rice were hot...steak...not so much...fail...hope I don't end up sick...for managers who read these...order #483...5-31-16.  6:23 pm<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You must only need a 0.04 GPA to work here or the "equivalent."

I will second, third, and fourth the emotion that this is the WORST Chipotle ever. 

Never has my order been right. They tell me they never receive my orders online. Then they magically appear... into something I never even ordered. Check your bags before you leave, I ordered tacos and got 3 tortillas with a side of salsa?!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's a pretty ok location...
I say "ok" because it's very normal that it's packed and never very clean at all, as I stand here now it's actually filthy and I'm taking it to go for that reason. The employees are always very courteous and helpful, they just need to get their sweeping/wiping up to speed maybe. Either way, I'll be back. The food is too good to avoid haha. I do prefer the Brea location to this one though.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A while back I went to this chipotle for the same delicious Barbadoa burrito I always get. This time was a little different. Got to a chunk of meat with a huge gummy disgusting artery in it. Have not been back since. So check your meat before you bite into big chunks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Sorry I have to write a negative review but it takes a lot for me to be in a restaurant and think "I have to Yelp this". First off horrible customer service, walking down the line my thoughts were, "dang everyone's having a bad day here". No smiles, no nothing. Second off I didn't wanna come here cuz of my last experience but since my fiancé seems to love it I gave it another try. When we went to sit down not one table was clean out of 13 tables (and yes that's an accurate count). I have no idea how so many tables are empty and filthy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been here a few times and always felt like the station wasn't as clean as it could be.. But the people are always very nice and helpful. The employees are friendly and generous in servings. But, there's been two occasions where I've had flies my salads... Sigh.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually love Chipotle, but this location sucks! It's always crowded as expected since it's right by CSUF. I don't mind a little wait, but I hate how they're so stingy with the meat here! I know I'm a tiny asian girl, but a girl's gotta eat!!! They're so inconsistent with portion size, the person before me will literally order the exact same thing I did but have way bigger portions! Ya'll need to get your act together!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I took my grandmother here one evening about a month ago. She was ahead of me in line so I handed her a $20 for her order. The cashier gave her two pennies back in change and all she ordered was a bowl. My grandmother, being kind of absent minded, didn't think much of it, but luckily I had noticed the mistake and spoke up. The girl opened the drawer and gave her the cash and coins she was owed and acted like she didn't do anything wrong. She didn't apologize, which makes me think she just plain didn't care and I wonder if she did it deliberately because of how old my grandmother was.

Then a few days ago I went by myself and the cashier shorted me a five dollar bill. It took a while before she finally gave it to me. I recognized her from the previous visit, but wasn't entirely sure if she was the cashier or had helped us with our order. Either way, I'm staying away from his location. It just seems really shady. Plus, the seating is extremely uncomfortable and the line is insanely long.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is chipotle. Same good quality in every store. This one in particular is near cal state fullerton and Troy high school. That means there are a lot of students and kids near by. Place is always packed. 

Just got back from New York, so glad that the pricing is way cheaper here. The place is clean, pretty generic definitely no homeless people loitering outside.

Anyway I get the burrito with the tortilla on the side or the double wrapped burrito.. That's the hook up! Get half meats, they usually give you a little more!

Chipotle is good. Will always default here when I'm around the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food quality is what you would expect, very fine ingredients. Nothing to complain about that. Temperature though is very cold (saving on heating costs?). The worst part though is how amazingly stingy they are. I actually laughed and asked my fiancé to look at how little of a topping they put. It was seriously funny and I thought they were playing a joke that many play in the food industry. If I want a full scoop of salsa, then give me a scoop of salsa. I mean come on, stop being so stingy. I'm not even asking for extra, I'm just asking for the regular amount, to fill the scoop up for each ingredient. The girl in particular was the short Asian one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just like any other chipotle. Food quality is fine.

Except this one is so friggin busy because its in a college town. The line is pretty long especially during meal times. Don't go here if you want 'fast' food.

Otherwise yum chipotle<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Been to so many chipotles and this place by far gives the least. Bought a drink, added guacamole along everything they offer and the food barely passes the brim of the plate. Not coming back again simply because it's NOT worth the money. Don't get me wrong, the food is great but portions are weak.

I rather eat across the street where it will fill me up for a cheaper price along with great taste. Pieology will definitely keep my business.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Horrible experience at the Fullerton Chipotle on State College.  We went in and saw brown welted lettuce.  I got a lettuce bowl anyways.  When we got to the vegetables there were hardly any left and she only put a small amount on my bowl.  When my husband asked for more for his bowl the server said "we do not have anymore"  I tried to clarify but she repeated "we do not have any more vegetables".  She also told the lady behind us the same.  I could not believe at 5pm on a Sat. that the restaurant would be out of vegetables.  The cheese and guacamole were also low and we had to ask for them to replace. When I ate my bowl, the lettuce tasted old and I pretty much picked at it and then threw it out.  About 5 minutes later another person walked in and asked about the vegetables, she was again told there were not more vegetables, but the customer persisted and was then told it would take 5-10 minutes for vegetables.  Why were we not told this?  Completely unacceptable treatment and disappointing food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is Chipotle is Chipotle.
Here's what you need to know about this location:
1. It is really crowded all the time when CSUF is in session - but over a holiday break it is much less so.
2. They don't short you on the meat or other toppings - but don't expect any freebies or handouts... they're on to you, crafty Chipotle regulars.
3. You will undoubtedly see someone in line in pajamas. College students, right?
4. This food is DELICIOUS!
5. I know it seems expensive but get some chips and guac. It's great!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the THIRD time I have gone to this chipotle and had terrible service. I go to this one cuz it's the closest one too me that isn't going out of the way. I went in and before greeting me, smiling at me, and didn't even look at me, the girl just said "what do you want". I said a steak burrito. I got to the end and asked for sour cream, cheese and guacamole. But because she wasn't paying attention to me and my order, instead she was talking to another worker about a phone call, she went to put corn on my burrito. As I saw her reaching for it I said "No no stop! No corn!" But again because she wasn't paying attention to me she put corn in my burrito. I said I didn't want corn and she was like "well....what do you want me to do?" I asked her to just scoop it off instead of asking for a whole no burrito and she scooped off maybe half and left a bunch on. I was already in a bad mood so I just left it be. THEN I got to the cashier and she gave attitude too!! I had a gift card with just a few dollars left and gave her that first and she said it didn't work. I said no it has money on it do it again. And she was like oh yeah haha. It's ridiculous how rude and disrespectful every person was to me. I won't ever come to this chipotle again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">DO NOT COME HERE! HEALTH RISK! There was condensation dripping from the AC vent from the top. Bf saw it drip into both of the rice containers and confronted the employee, she asked which one it contaminated and proceeded to just switch around the containers. She did not ask for a new fresh batch to be made and had the audacity to ask which rice he wanted AFTER she just switched the containers around. DISGUSTING! I would give it ZERO stars if I could. As far as I could tell, they didn't plan on changing the rice, when I told her never mind on the food and started walking away, she looked confused as to why I would not be dining there. It would be probably safer to eat food thrown on the floor, at least they clean the floor every night... Can't say much for the AC vent.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They hook it up here and the staff works fast! On top of that the food was perfectly prepared.  I had double steak and it was soft and not chewy.  My girlfriend had the chicken which is probably going to be my chipotle goto from now on<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is better than most Chipotles. The employees are nice, they make your food quickly, and if you ask for a little more of something they don't seem to be as stingy as other places.  

My only real complaint is that it's annoying to park once you get here and that the line is usually really long since it's right next to Cal State Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">By far THE WORST Chipotle location. They barely give out any sides and if you ask for more, they give you very little. You have to continuously ask for more in order to be up to every other locations' standard. Tip: if Diane is rolling and/or doing your bowl, complain when you get home to the manager (usually Lourdes). 
Honestly, Chipotle is usually very generous but this location is terrible. I understand if they put limit on the amount of meat, but everything else is usually very generous ESPECIALLY if you ask for more. 
Do NOT go here- look for an alternative. 
I came here three times and they definitely gave me half a spoonful of corn and 5 pieces of lecture the first time. When I asked for more? A quarter spoonful of corn and 2 pieces of lettuce. 
C'MON!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love chipotle and it never disappoints me. I will always come back here..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Like it's not bad enough that they charge you an extra dollar for steak. They were running very low on steak but that's what I wanted. A considerate person would've noticed that they were out and would've asked me to see if I wanted to wait until they made more but instead the lady gave me what was left which is about six pieces. I won't be coming back here again<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I could not believe the slow service. Having the line out to the door should have been a clue to go somewhere else. 

I ordered a bowl to go. Got a bag with nothing in it but the bowl. No fork no napkins. Do these idiots think I'm going to eat it with my fingers?

Go somewhere else, shut this one down.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I discovered this Chipotle while on a road trip from Bakersfield to a dance club in Placentia; I knew dancing all evening was going to make me hungry, but I didn't want to eat anything that would sit heavy in my stomach and make it uncomfortable to dance.  This Chipotle, located on the Northwest corner of E Chapman and N State College, seemed like a great compromise; they serve fast, healthy, non-greasy food in a clean and friendly environment.

The restaurant was spacious and clean with plenty of seating.  There were seven tall round tables along the windows facing E Chapman and ample seating at regular sized tables in the covered outdoor area to East along N State College Blvd. People were sitting and eating out here in spite of the stormy weather and rain proving that Southern Californians are not ALL the wimps the people in the Pacific Northwest think we are.

There was a very long line, when have you ever been in a Chipotle that DIDN'T have a line, but the workers kept it moving pretty quickly so the wait wasn't too bad.  I ordered my current favorite, the barbacoa bowl with brown rice, black beans, and guacamole, but there are actually quite a few different items you can order as you build your own meal to suit your own tastes.

For those unfamiliar with Chipotle (yeah, you, the guy from Vermont or some small town on the Eastern Seaboard) you stand in what looks like a cafeteria line and start by telling the first worker whether you want a bowl, a salad, a burrito, or a taco.  Then you choose between chile lime rice or Bowen rice, pinto beans or black beans, and choose your protein, steak, barbacoa (a seasoned slow roasted pulled beef), chicken, carnitas, or sofritas (seasoned tofu).  There are plenty of other toppings to choose from, and it's all up to you and your individual tastes.  Do you want salsa (red, hot, corn, or pico de gallo)?  Perhaps some veggies (lettuce, grilled onions and peppers)? Perhaps some sour cream, cheese, or guacamole.?   Guacamole is the only thing that costs a little extra, but take it from me - it's worth every penny.

The proteins are all responsibly sourced, cruelty free, and absent hormones or antibiotics so you can feel as confident about the health benefits as you do about the taste.

This was one of the nicer Chipotles I have visited, with it's pleasant atmosphere, ample seating both inside and out, large portion sizes, and even clean restrooms.



Restrooms clean<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is a restaurant that I never feel guilty giving my money to.  The food is consistently good and their farming methods are a lot more ethical than other fast food chains.  The CEO is constantly raving about it, and saying that other restaurants should follow his lead in raising cageless/open range farm animals.

Even though the prices just went up for a few of the times on the menu, I think the price for a burrito here is totally worth it. The chicken is the best tasting chicken you can get for a fast food chain.  And the guacamole is really  great too.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Past to present review! Boy the service and food have really flown downhill it seems! I used to come before when the food was you know.. good? It's pretty sad to think Chipotle could hit this kind of low but boy did this place ever. 

I ordered my typical bowl with brown rice black beans chicken salsa and sour cream not that difficult right? Well 2 things were added incorrectly to the bowl since I had to practically yell my order from the other end of the glass! 

So there goes my food down the food line while i stay behind the patrons in front. The employees would ask what i wanted and i would answer. Things went great until it came to the salsa! "Can i get hot salsa?" Sure let me get you a scoop of mild and a scoop of corn? Lol!!! Uhhhhh didn't want either! Oh well! (Didn't ask to fix =)

Chicken was ok a bit dry (it's a chain I get it) the brown rice however was so hard it was like munching on a bowl of pebbles. Didn't get the correct salsa (F) and the sour cream was well sour cream. 

Did I mention this place is like super stingy with their portions (not to be a fat***) but it's not super cheap $$$ and with other locations delivering much better tasting portions. 

Super long lines if you go anytime between 11:30 am and 8:00 pm especially at this location since it's near the college which means parking during those times can be a pain as well!

Staff were nice and it's great to see Chipotle hires people from all walks of life it was a very diverse group of staff here love it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As a huge fan of Chipotle, I'm sad that I have to live a block away from THIS particular store. The lines are always long because of all the college kids (get off my lawn!!) and the portions are smaller than most other ones I've been to. Hope you enjoy your 8 chunks of steak! Honestly, the only reason I still go to this one is I can't justify driving to the next closest Chipotle when this one is within walking distance. And so, convenience forces me to accept the free side of disappointment that comes with every order I get from here. 

There's a Yogurtland next door though, so that's cool.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I came here around lunch time and yes the like seemed long, but the wait wasn't that bad. The service was actually quick. I had chips with my order and I just noticed they don't taste as lemony how they use to be. Overall I still love chipotle<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">There is no such thing as assembly line here. Isn't that the point of chipotle? Usually you get annoyed because you can't hear them from rushing you through the line. But not here, one person at a time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Pretty typical stuff for the area....terrible undergrad drivers that think they are hot stuff in the parking lot, workers that give you blank stares when you ask for a little cheese then they put a huge mound on, workers that ask you what you want then ask again 5 seconds later, person at the register doesn't understand friendliness, etc. It does the trick though...nothing special.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Such bad treatment tonight by the manager. We came in late (about an hour and a half before closing) and it wasn't busy but the young man in the middle of the line seemed rushed and was terse and rude. The first worker didn't give my daughter the last little bit of carnitas and left her burrito waiting for fresh meat (and doesn't Chipotle pride themselves on fresh ingredients?) I told him since we were together (along with my son and husband who were also behind us) he could do my bowl first. I explained we were waiting for fresh carnitas and he snapped at the other worker. Why didn't she give her the old little bit if carnitas?  Even though it wasn't busy he was rushed tossing the food together quickly but kind of violently. When we first walked up I heard him declare sharply he was going home as soon as he finished our order. He was tossing the food so hard that some of the food in my bowl flew out. I suggested maybe he shouldn't be in such a hurry to go home. He snapped at me rudely and said he wasn't in a hurry he was doing his job. I stepped over to the cashier and watched his continued hostility. My daughter was told it would be another five minutes for fresh carnitas (a couple of the cooks were goofing off in the food prep area) so she switched to steak.  I quietly asked the cashier, who seemed to be shrinking back from the the angry co-worker what his name was. He overheard me and snapped, "My name is Justin, and I'M the manager MA'AM!!!" I told him that was a real shame, and it is. A manager ought to have good people skills and he clearly didn't, not with us, not with the other employees.  I spent $50 for decent food and LOUSY service, hostile even. Calling me ma'am didn't make the tone and attitude even remotely professional. I used to manage a restaurant and I never would have treated a customer the way he treated me, totally unprofessional and disrespectful. I should have gone to Del Taco. I would've saved a lot if money and more importantly probably have been treated a lot better. I don't think I'll ever go back to this store, spent way too much to be treated that way.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love chipotle but this place is the stingist... And treats Thier customers as if we are in a lunch line. They just moved my food faster down then what I can asked me.

I'd say I'd def won't come back if it was my choice. I rather drive a little better for better service<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">A fresh, tasty meal and patio seating in just ten minutes during the lunchtime rush hour in August. Chipotle is a favorite of mine for its flavorful, fairly-healthy menu and sustainable food-sourcing goals.  This location did not disappoint. 

Parking: lot right in front. Beware that its a little tight.
Clean? Yep!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really sad that my chicken bowl has unpleasant burnt chicken that had me wincing. Got a chicken bowl with tortilla on the side. Fairly busy but also wished that tables were  tad cleaner.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As a regular here for almost 4 years, I must say that my experience was and probably always will be pleasant. My usual order is a burrito bowl with half chicken half steak on white rice with everything on it and guac on the side. My tastebuds are always so satisfied! The quality of their food is great compared to other locations such as Ball and Euclid. The service is super quick and the staff are all friendly!! 

It can be really busy at times, especially during the semester so I understand why sometimes the tables haven't been wiped down. But what can you expect? The food court at CSUF is absolutely terrible and this is one of the few places around that serves quality food. Indeed, the lines can be pretty long and parking can be hard to find because it's next to CSUF and Troy but it really is worth the wait if you are not in a time crunch.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ive been going to this chipotle for about 10 years now. I've always loved the staff here but they just hired a new skinny tall African American chick she is usually at the register during the night shifts and well i simply can not stand her. She always looks like she hates her job. It makes it so that even though ive had a great experience i leave feeling bothered. The first time i saw her there i had a to go order and she asked me if it was to eat there... the bowl had a lid on it. Okay what ever told her it was to go. But then she didn't even bag my stuff i had to ask her if they were out of bags and she responded with "oh you want a bag?" Umm duhh what am i going to do walk out with all my items in my hands.. No. I hope Chipotle looks at these reviews and thinks about who they have working for them.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Ordered online for a pick up time of 10:30. The store didn't open til 11. Went to the store and even called whilst the workers were there live and the store workers didn't open the door. Not cool, bro.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love chipotle except their employees.
I was there yesterday 1/26 at around 6:30ish and wow are those employees rude!
I ordered a chicken burrito with white rice, pinto beans, sour cream, cheese and lettuce. There was a caucasian male, early 20's, he made my burrito so bad! He hardly put a spoon full of rice and pinto beans. So I asked him if he could put some more rice and he seemed so bothered. If you're having a bad day, or don't feel like showing up to work, don't show up at all! It was terrible customer service, there was 2 people on register and they seemed to be talking crap about the customers. Why don't you supervise your employees into making a customers visit a good one?! If I'm going to pay $7, best believe I want that meal the way it should be.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Definitely got food poisoning from this location yesterday.

I have been to this location many times and have had no issues until yesterday. My fiancé and I ordered bowls(chicken/steak), she got brown rice/medium salsa and I got white rice/hot salsa. Maybe the rice or the salsa was bad because I definitely did not enjoy the remainder of my night.

Probably won't be going to this location again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love chipotle. the quality and freshness but these dudes really need to get better at customer service and cooking their chicken a bit more thoroughly, man. Steak is alright medium rare but chicken shouldn't be pink and slimy in the middle. (Sooooo if ya don't want stomachache, avoid the pollo). 
Service is kinda splotchy there too, possibly because they deal with a lot of college students wanting more in their burritos....however I've gotten a couple sassy girls at the register and couple rude dudes making the burritos. But it's only been a couple, so customer service can be a bit inconsistent. This review is specific to this chipotle.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I LOVE chipotle.....but have to say this specific location is is horrible. I've given it two visits now and both experiences were horrible. The food was bland and the rice was almost watery. The employees are college kids who don't seem to care. At checkout both times they tried charging me for guac even though I had a veggie bowl. I won't be visiting this location again but I sure do hope they can clean their act up!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is a 2-star review because the cashier was kind enough to give me the names of the employees that hassled us. 

With that in mind, the rest of this is a 1-star review. 

We waited in line for a few minutes. I started asking for a bowl with white rice when I got to the counter, I had already noticed that the white rice container was empty. I couldn't see any rice unless I tip toed. In other chipotles, the employees would normally ask for rice to be prepared when there's less than 1/4 left of the container. I would think even more so when there's a long line. 

Knowing that there was already barely any rice, I asked for extra in hopes of them just giving me a newly made one. Instead, the first server, Onie, decided to desperately scrape the container to get what he can. He didn't ask for more rice to be made until my girlfriend asked for white rice on her bowl. It was then that the five minute wait at the cafeteria line began. 

Onie then asked my girlfriend what kind of meat she wanted, to which she responded, "I don't know yet." He just stared blankly at her, then stared at the server next to him, Raquari. Raquari then pressed my girlfriend again as to what kind of meat she wanted, and when Raquari was informed that she was still deciding, Raquari harassed her with, "Well, we have a process here." Onie jumps in with, "So, no meat, then?" 

After my girlfriend informs them that she'd like to wait for the rice that was barely being made, the two servers rolled their eyes at each other and played with the empty bowl, ignored us until the rice was ready, and just put others' orders ahead instead. 

I've had numerous rude interactions with the employees at this chipotle, but each visit just keeps becoming more and more unbearable. 

It seems like this Chipotle forgoes good service in the name of profits.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the best Chipotle on the planet.  First, I am a big fan of Chipotle and go a few times a week, but it is different at different ones.  Here, you get great portions, the staff is friendly and super fast and they are always happy.

Absolutely love it here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hate that I have to deal with the parking lot when going to this location, but after trying the location on Imperial and Associated 2-3 times (and being disappointed), it's worth it to come here when I'm craving Chipotle. Their taste is consistent and they give you a good amount of meat without making you ask for it. 

Try to come at off-hours (ie. not 12pm) if you can to make your wait shorter. Service quality varies, I've had really nice servers and then others who look like they would rather be anywhere else.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">LOVE CHIPOTLE, just maybe not this location. Long line ups of college kids, need I say more?

On the plus side, LOVE the fresh ingredients and the flavors. The veggie burrito with EVERYTHING on it is to die for! The tortillas are the freshest that I have ever tasted, so chewy and warm, and the salsas, yum, yum, yum! It can get extra messy so make sure to grab lots of napkins. My favorite way to eat this is at home, surrounded by lots and lots of towels!

Try it, just be prepared to be treated like cattle, long and slow moving lines, and flustered employees!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is about our visit on 9/26/14 at around 3 pm. 

Now, I know that portions differ depending on the server, and I understand that. However, compromising how you treat the customer shouldn't be dependent on the person. 

I've been to chipotle during rush hours, and this visit was relatively slow, and the restaurant wasn't too loud either. When I requested for sour cream, the woman immediately dumped corn on the bowl while she annoyingly repeated what she thought she heard, and then looked at me as if I was an idiot when I said, "sour cream, not corn. I do not want corn." She just looked at me as if I was just wasting her time. 

Instead of apologizing, she made it known how much extra work it was to get a new bowl made, which she hastily splattered a ridiculous amount of sour cream on one end of the bowl, as if to sarcastically make it all better. 

I was disappointed, and really annoyed to the point where I've decided never to come back to this location, despite it being the most convenient one. 

I wish that the employees wore name tags so that they can take more responsibility for their actions, and that the entire location doesn't have to take the heat. But due to lack of names, this location is losing a customer.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst chipotle. Had to repeat order multiple times. Ordered kids food charged for adult. Messy. Slow. Out of chips out of steak. 2pm and not that busy to ruin out of food. Just yucky... Terrible...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Awful experience don't order online at this location they gave away our paid for items because they "got slammed" and then promised us a refund while we waited an extra 15 minutes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Highly Dissatisfied with the service my friends and I have experienced tonight. We ordered 2 bowls and 1 burrito and the lady lied to me about the price of my bowl stating that it was $1.50 cheaper than it really was which caused me to be charged with overdraft on my debit card . Second, the lady helping my friend with his order split the burrito in the process of wrapping it up. Lastly, during the checkout for my last friends bowl, the lady left the register to check her phone. HER PHONE!?!?!? If I'm not mistaken, chipotle employees are not supposed to check their phones while they are working. So tonight we have had an overall bad experience with this particular chipotle.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Idk if it's me but I feel as if Chipotles over all quality of food has dropped to the floor!
The other day I went into this chipotle on state college hoping to get a delicious burrito and while standing in line a customer was returning her salad because she had found a hair in it. Now after seeing that I should of ran through the door.. as if that wasn't bad enough I then looked straight into the back where the cooks cook and I saw a young man who works there legit stick his hand inside the bucket where they keep their chips and eat straight out of it.. how unprofessional and disgusting is that!!! 

Well to top it off after I received my burrito I sat outside to eat it and after a few bites I was just not satisfied. There was hardly any steak it was mostly full of beans and rice. 

Later on that day I arrived home to only find myself nauseous and with a huge stomach ache ... 

Idk if it might have been just this location but as for me Chipotles quality of food is garbage and the customer service was terrible.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Jade, the employee, cashed me out. Incredibly rude lady! She is short, some weight on her and had a gold nose ring. She basically threw my to-go bag at me and it turned over, spilling all the juice from my chicken bowl. Not to mention she squished the bottom bowl since she just dumped everything in the bag like a pile of trash! My boyfriend started to take everything out and asked for a new bag. She literally gave us the rudest look and ignored us. She gave us one after we asked again. We didn't want to make a scene there but we definitely spoke to the manager. This lady has no manners! How did she even land a job. JADE is the worst employee I have ever come across.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Very long waiting at this location. Employees clearly do not care and management is non existent. The employees are usually chatting and taking their sweet time even when they have long lines. Also, they run out of ingredients often. Very poor management and organization. Try a different Chipotle location. Not worth the wait or being treated like you are an inconvenience.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I only gave it 1 star because you had to put at least that to write a review. Today was the last time I'll be eating at chipotle possibly ever, but more specifically the one on state college. They gave me a half scoop of everything I asked for and I had to ask for another scoop of everything just so the portion would be regular. Then when I asked for a little more meat she told me it'd be extra for 1more half scoop. I asked why they were being so stingy with the portions since I'd been to chipotle a thousand times and they normally give regular sized scoops. She told me it had always been 1scoop. I told her okay. The half scoop cost me $3.15. I also purchased some chips. The total was 13.74 for a steak bowl with chips that is now a regular portion because I had to pay extra for it to be the regular amount. And the people I spoke to that were serving weren't friendly, they were very dry. Don't go here unless you want to pay a meals price for a snack and still be hungry. Or you can take that $15 you'd spend here and go to an actual restaurant and automatically get a regular portion.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">let me say.... im a HUGE chipotle fan...

let down. this place has flies flying around everywhere getting near the food and by far got the least amount of food here out of all the chipotles ive been to. go somewhere else if possible.... not acceptable to chipotle standards. step it up!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food was great, it was sad to see the 2 guys working the line being loud and yelling the females names across the line.  As the supervisor just stood there laughing at them as they ignore customers and laugh at each other .. Just for the stores info.  Today is wed sept 24 @ 1330 pm.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">For those ones who are looking for a catering review for 20 people: Expensive (the cheapest one is $12/person) but super worthy.
The portions may seem a bit disappointing at first, but trust me they will kill the 20-people Chipotle craving! I've just had some issues with the quantity of the steak, but the manager gave me one full tray when I stopped by again. 
If you're doing catering lemme recommend this: cover your food until you serve, otherwise it will get dry.
Thank you Chipotle!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Why am I writing a negative review here? Seriously, it's CHIPOTLE, a FRANCHISE. 
Not sure why this one sucks so much. The workers here are rude and unfriendly and really skimp on the portions. I understand if there are corporate standards that only permit workers to give you a certain amount of food, but a smile here or there would be nice. Every time I come in here, I feel a certain level of hostility from the workers who are clearly unhappy and don't want to be there. 
I love Chipotle at other locations, but I will never come back to this one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I just had a late lunch here and was not impressed with the front of the property... napkins and debris a go go. I ordered the Carnitas burrito with rice, beans, and guacamole.  The carnitas were bland if not completely tasteless... pretty much the same on the guacamole (disappointing on 3 fronts: bland; small portion; pricey $1.90 for a bit more than a tablespoon).  It is a filling portion of rice and beans.. but I'll not order carnitas here again. The cashier was working (?) in the back and had to be called out to the register as the gent and his kids ahead of me waited for her to show up.  All in all $9.00 for a filling but blah burrito.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place gets so busy!
I came at 3 and it was a long line that took forever. They kept having to refill everything. I saw they were giving out huge portions to patrons before me so I was excited! but when it got to me, I was so jipped! I barely got any meat, veggies..So I asked for more and the girl eyed me. Girl, I'm just tryna get my $$ worth and I'm hongray!! 

They were probably short staffed because the cashier kept running to clean up but what grossed me out was she was cleaning around the trash and stuck her hand in there to push it down then ran back to the register and was handling the food and closing tops to containers. Really unsanitary..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My friend wanted to eat here for lunch so I was game.  I pre-planned my meal ahead of time with a calculator and the nutrition guide and was surprised you can keep the fat and calories pretty low for a fast food place.

I ordered the "Bowl" which for those who haven't been to a chipotle it is all the burrito fillings of your choice served in a bowl instead of a tortilla.  Since the tortilla alone is 290 calories it's a smart choice.  I had the cilantro-lime rice, black beans, fajita vegetables, steak, red salsa, and lettuce for a grand total of 485 calories and 11 grams of fat which isn't bad considering the huge portion and the fact it's fast food.  All the ingredients tasted really fresh and went well together.  I was surprised how much flavor the fajita veggies added to the meal.  They were grilled up and seasoned.

My only complaints are the horrible chairs.... who the eff picked these out?  They are so effen uncomfortable!!!  The huge lake of water around the soda machine sucked too....   mop that shyte up!  Don't just put a warning sign next to it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Place is pretty bomb, love that you can create your own dish. I don't eat meat, so I tried the sofritas and I was a little disappointed. It was a little spicy, however I do like spicy foods, it just reminded me of chorizo, maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it. Their fajitas are good though! You should definitely get that with whatever you normally enjoy. Mmm, I'm hungry :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This chipotle's set up is really inefficient and the line moves slow. If you order steak go to the one on State College because the steak here is terrible. It was gray, tough, and had no flavor. Even my boyfriend said his food tasted really weird. Super disappointed! Won't be coming back. Avoid this Chipotle!!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What kind of store does this, close for holiday party without posting anything. Ita on the final week and its late at night, they close without notice<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Have visited plenty of chipotles in the past including this one, but this time was very disappointing. I understand when it's busy you're going to run out of food faster but that doesn't mean you have to serve a smaller portion just so you won't have to cook more. The chicken bowl was basically empty I hate to do this but management needs to be aware that it's unacceptable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Let me just say, I've worked in food service  at country clubs before so I know how crazy people can be about their food. For that reason, I empathize with people in food service and I'll always tip on takeout, etc. However, I don't empathize with laziness. 

I'm a big Chipotle fan... When it's done right. I ordered online and payed ahead of time - allowing 30 minutes to prepare a burrito and a burrito bowl. A reasonable amount of time to prepare the order, right? Wrong. 

The burrito bowl was fine but instead of the burrito, they gave me a second bowl. I was pretty bummed but I understand how "burrito" and "burrito bowl" look the same [insert slight sarcasm]. I'm still pretty stoked to eat it and when I open it, it's not what I asked for. I'm not going to drive back to make them fix it, so I'm taking it out via Yelp. 

Common sense tells us to check the order when we get it. I usually check but my brother picked it up for us. Since he did me a favor, he's not going to get chewed out. 

In all honesty, the employee gets paid to do a job; they don't have to love it but they should be able to do it. I won't be back to this location; but... Employees: for the sake of your future customers, when you prepare an order, read the receipt that you print out and staple to the front of the bag! Chipotle: don't integrate tech and convenience, if you don't have the resources to uphold your customer service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Consistently good, but pricey. I've had nearly everything on their menu. 

I go here when I want a Mexican food kick but don't want to risk food poisoning by going "authentic".<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I used to always get the bowl which is tasty but now I'm obsessed with there tacos. Barbacoa with the mild salsa is quite good too.

If anybody knows some secret menu stuff i'd love to hear about it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is THE WORST Chipotle. EVER. 
My 3rd time coming to this place, & tonight will be the LAST time I come to this Chipotle location. 
*Food Quality:
Why is the quality SO different?? The Mild Salsa (Pico de Gallo) is soggy & goopy with little bubbles, I think they blend it instead of chopping it, no lie. Guacamole, 2nd time they have "run out of avocados"; forget about having everything in stock, they are ALWAYS scrimmaging in the back to put things together. When I asked for veggies, they picked up the last 4 PIECES & practically threw my Burrito Bowl to the next employee. & a customer in FRONT of me was STILL waiting for her salad dressing as I was leaving. Appalling. 
Steak was extremely chewy, too chewy; everything was so different. 
*Customer Service: 
I am dumbfounded. Extremely rude to their customers, they obviously don't care about the food they're serving. They do not communicate with each other; I had to verbally tell 3 employees that I was waiting for extra veggies (because obviously they were out), they just left my Burrito Bowl there, randomly, there. At the end, the girl did not want to be there. Her face summed up my entire experience here. 
I have been to SO MANY Chipotles, guilty, & I have never been SO upset and disappointed from leaving one of my GO-TO places. 
This Chipotle may be the closest location to me, but I am willing to drive the extra miles for the classic Chipotle service & food quality. Save your time, head to the next Chipotle!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Chipotle!!!  I rarely come here though but on the day that I came, it was Teacher Appreciation Day so of course being the frugal person that I am, I went after work and waited in line!  When I got there, there was about 40 people (teachers probably) in front of me.  I was expecting it to be about an hour wait but the line was moving pretty quickly.  Before I knew it, I was ready to order.  I love the Barbacoa meat and of course I added the guac!  Doesn't matter if its extra because it was a BOGO free deal for me!  The workers were super nice and efficient!  Great job you guys!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Worst chipotle I have ever been to. Portions are skimpy. The communication between workers is not quite there. No worker at the cash register often when there is a line. Skimps on chips. When they begin to run out of something they give you even less.... Considerably less. Manager here needs to revamp this place and how they run it. Its terrible. Its always one thing or another at this place every time my girlfriend and I go. Orangethorpe Chipotle is the Chipotle to go.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Used to go here as I lived in the area.

The worst service!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I recently went to this chipotle location for dinner. I was VERY disappointed with both the food and the customer service that was provided. The ordering process felt very chaotic and stressful as the employees rushed me and were already taking the orders of customers two people behind me in line before the line could have a chance to move forward. I was most disappointed tho when i received the bowl that i ordered and found it to have only half of the amount of food in it that i would normally receive at other chipotle locations. I even overheard an employee telling the other workers to put less ingredients. I will not return to this location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">WHO DOESN'T LIKE CHIPOTLE?!

this is always a good choice to come and grab some lunch for an inexpensive price! I usually ask for extra sour cream, cheese and salsa since they don't charge you for it and my usually steak burrito bowl. I sometimes get the tortilla on the side or not at all depending on how i feel.

The other day i visited this Chipotle and the thing i noticed was how bad the communication was amongst everyone. I asked the guy for a double steak burrito bowl which was passing the message down the line, but since the guy putting on the topping didn't hear i got a double steak bowl for the price of a regular bowl! Not that i'm complaining since it was an awesome deal, but it just seemed like the entire staff was in such a rush to get everyone's order done no one is working together efficiently.

I come to this Chipotle the most since it's close by campus and near my apartments, i'd recommend coming 30 minutes prior to closing as they tend to be more generous with how much they give ;) More bang for your buck!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">We love CHIPOTLE but this one is a pigsty!  There is food all over the floor.  The tables were all dirty until we asked someone to come wipe them down. The bathrooms look as though they haven't been checked in over an hour.  The cashier acted like she had an attitude. The music was way too loud.  We couldn't hear each other talk. 
The food was good at least.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nobody even smiled, but the lady ringing you up at the end. You asked for anything it seemed like you were an inconvenience being there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went in at 4:30 pm and the line was short.  I am not sure why I was being rushed.  I happened to point to the salsa with my finger (for some reason, the word wouldn't come out) and it went over the glass shield and the older lady worker frowned at me and told me not to do that.  She actually said "don't do that".  Why so serious???  On one of the bowls, I asked sour cream and cheese and they quickly put the lid on (I was seriously rushed for some reason).  I assumed it was in there.  When I got home, there was NO sour cream and NO cheese.  If you rush the chances of making a mistake is really high, don't they know that?  I asked for 3 sides of hot sauce and she only poured one container, I asked her if she did the other 2 containers and again she gave me a dirty look.  No apologies, just a dirty look.  I agree with the others, the portion on the meat is always quite small at this location.  With this particular employee, I think she will scare off some customers with her lack of customer skills, especially her dirty look.  She was frowning the whole time.  If you work at a fast food restaurant, you need the basics, a smile, apologize when necessary and thank the customer.  I plan on not going to this location anymore and try the Brea location even though it is further from my house.  I don't want to be served by this employee.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have never wanted to throw away a chicken burrito bowl in my life. Well that all changed after I came here. 

#1- I understand that this chipotle is a bit busy compared to other ones. However, it does not seem like an acceptable excuse to be unfriendly. 

#2- This chipotle seems way saltier compared to the other ones I go to. 

#3- More than half of my burrito bowl is covered in black particles. And no, they are not beans. It's covered in the burnt remains of the chicken. 

In conclusion, I don't think I will come to this chipotle anymore, unless I am starving in Fullerton.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I'm not gonna comment on the food (because I love the food and everyone already knows how good it is), but the location.

It's one of the only Chipotle restaurants that's in a lot that is actually LARGE. Parking there is no issue, hallelujah!
It's also pretty big inside compared to other locations... and there's also a bunch of seating outside. I wish the Chipotle by my house was this large!

Five stars for lots of seating, easy parking, great service, and tasty as hell food.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Chipotle but many of employees are rude and management doesn't seem to really care. They make their work seem like it's such a chore, especially the ones working the add-ons. Learn how to plaster on a fake smile at least.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars its because the parking is kind of limited, but that is not their fault. Great place to eat and clean.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love love love Chipotle. They have amazing bowls and everything is always so fresh and hot. I love how you pick as you go and they out it together in front of you as well so you know what's going on with your food. The only negative about Chipotle in general is that guacamole is kind if expensive. $1.70 extra in a burrito? It's not like they give us that much in it to make it worth it. As a side with chips, sure. Even in the bowls it's okay, but not in a burrito. 

This locations is pretty busy in general. It's across the street from CSUF and down the street from FJC and close to some high schools. It's also in the same plaza as Starbucks and Pick-Up Sticks and Yogurtland, so parking is kind of iffy sometimes. Otherwise, this is the location I go to!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everyone who writes about how horrible the service here is correct. The food is fine, but seriously, by the time I get my food I just want to throw it back at them. 

Just because it is fast food doesn't mean the service has to be so terrible. It is too bad the management here isn't interested in hiring pleasant people or training people properly. Putting a bunch of bitchy girls at the front counter isn't the best business move.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Had a steak burrito. The meat was really hard and couldn't even bite into it. The steak meat quality is really low. I expected more of this place. But I ended up putting every single piece of steak aside and eating the rest. 
Please give real steak and not only cartilage the next time please.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I never thought I would ever give chipotle a 2 star.. but after today's lunch, I had to. I ordered chicken bowl. Everything else is fine but the chicken tasted like it was bathed in salt. It was so salty, to the point that I didn't want to finish it.. 
They need to really maintain quality control of their food..<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I know all chipotle get busy but the employees don't put an effort into making the line go faster. Slow service<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Knowing that there are better Mexican restaurants in the area that I can visit, I come here because this shopping plaza has a variety of food locations to choose from. Plus, you can't go wrong with having Pinkberry for dessert afterwards.

The food here is OK here but my real gripe are the prices they charge for their food. I can't remember the last time I paid $10 for to go food and the quality being mediocre. I mean it beats Taco Bell and Del Taco but sometimes their meat, especially their carne asada, is real chewy and fatty. I want to be able to bite into beef that's lean and doesn't take me 30 chews to get the food down. Their chicken is good, seems healthy, and I prefer getting the rice bowl over the burrito. That's the Asian in me that's talking. I checked out their food calorie content, also disappointing. Makes me wonder why I exercise and still continue to make poor food choices. I don't think I'll come here for a while unless my co-workers decide to.

The dining area is clean and the workers seem nice. My friend Elvia commented that they play good music but seriously, I didn't come here for a dinner and a show. Maybe, next time I'll skip the lunch and go next door to shop at Total Wine & More. If you didn't know, that's the alcoholic in me that's talking.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have to REALLY want Chipotle to come to this location. All of the college kids make this location not worth it most of the time. College kids in line. College kids working there. College kids everywhere! They're all walking around with their tank tops and their ombre hair and their iPhones and being loud and making the lines long. During the five minutes I was in line, I listened to a CSFU girl's whole life story. She was behind me talking about how she didn't know if she should get a salad or a bowl with lettuce (life is hard) and somehow ended up crying about how her mom is her hero and when she graduates, she owes everything to her. I wanted to get out of line but then I remembered the guacamole. So the food is as good as Chipotle can be, but unless you're in college, get your burrito and get the heck out of there! o_O<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is like heaven on earth! I go there almost every week. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful,  and the food is always fresh even if you come at 8 pm.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This chipotle is always busy! I usually hit this place up after practice & I don't mind the long lines, but sometimes the workers there don't put enough in the bowl & it's like not worth the money. This place is really clean tho & they have quality food!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Chipotle  is one of the bigger ones ive been to but it does get packed! Ive heard this is one of the top 10 in sales of all Chipotles. The workers do a good job working effeciently and keeping the line moving. The food quality is fresh (since its always packed) and they actually hook you up with a good amount of meat compared to some locations where they skimp you and you give them a sad face lol. Overall a great Chipotle lots of tables and fresh food but just be sure to try and avoid the standard lunch and dinner times at this one.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's been 2 1/2 years since my original review and I still go here for lunch 5 days a week. Freshly made good quality food quickly.

Don't understand some of the poor reviews since this place has a line to the door pretty much any time of the day, but at least the very long line moves along quickly.

Oh, and Monica your guac is the best!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hadn't been to a Chipotle in like a year & the last time it was free (a co-worker submitted a business card & his card was drawn so my work got free burritos). It's as big & delicious as I remember...the burritos that is. 
It's a lot of food for your money...I can't eat the whole thing in one sitting...I don't come  often only cuz I can think of other places to spend less than $6 on Mex-style food, but it is worth the money 4 what you get.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place.  It is a great place to get a cheap meal that will fill you up for the rest of the night.  I love that everytime I come the food always tastes the same, I never have any complaints.  

The only issue with this location is the amount of people who come here during the lunch rush.  The shopping center it's in has a starbucks, yogurtland, and a pick up stix so it's really popular and the parking lot is very tiny.  The line will go all the way around the restaurant, so make sure you have plenty of time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Dinning area was dirty and unkept! Used there bathroom and a female staff came in then a male staff soon after which alarmed me why was he in there while other patrons are in there ???? don't know which a manager should find out. Staff in the kitchen were very loud sounded like they're having a party. One of the staff members was even screaming out loud for no apparent reason and didn't seem to care that there is other patrons were having dinner.  This place is a zoo! Won't come back here again!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one shitty establishment! I used to work at the chino hills chipotle and i thought that one was bad. but fuck these people didn't have shit for my burrito! and tubby working tortilla was slow as fuck<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Nasty. This chipotle is sorry and gives others a bad rep.  Most disappointing is customer service. Rude and unfriendly employees. Isn't chipotle based upon fresh food and produce? Not. The lettuce was wilted and old and veggies burnt. Disgusting.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I really love the burrito bowl they make.. And it's my favorite meal that I can have anytime almost every day.. Affordable and healthy food.. Bon a petite<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The person who was at the front of the assembly line was extremely rude. I ordered a salad, and she asked me if I wanted the dressing on the side, so I said yes. She apparently did not hear me, and demanded, "yeah or no?" There wasn't even a line behind me, and I had given her a response, so there was no need for her to be impatient and angry. 

As if her rudeness weren't enough, after eating, I went to go use the facilities, only to find that one of two toilets was not working, and the stall with the functioning toilet did not have a functional door/lock. The right sink (one of two) was also not working. 

I used to enjoy coming to Chipotle, but this is unacceptable. I would never recommend this place to anyone anymore.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I dont even want to give place one star. Two of your dumbest workers fucking ripped me off. They weren't able to PUT ONE BOWL TOGETHER PROPERLY.  I get home and open it and its like half empty and missing stuff.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Compared to other Chipotles, this one is on the suckier side.  The place gets pretty filthy as they have a good amount of customer traffic going through.  Parking is horrendous, but it is probably the best Mexican food you will get within a walk to CSUF with the nearest competition being Del Taco. Service is slow as they are mostly staffed by college students. They tend to flirt with better looking customers and give them bigger portions.  Unfortunately I am ugly so I always get short changed.  It also doesn't help that I always look angry when I come here. Sometimes the wait in line takes 20 min, finding parking another 10, finding a spot to eat 5 - who would have thought that eating in a fast casual place takes almost an hour. It's great if you are a student and have all the time in the world, but if you have a job, I would order online.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is my favorite Chipotle. Why?
It makes me feel like I'm back in college. Always lots of students from Cal State Fullerton across the street.

I sometimes get the taco kids meal. It's a lot cheaper and matches my apatite, besides it's fun the way they set it up ao you can build them yourself.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place had good food but it was overflowing with trash. The bathrooms were disgusting and it looks like no one has wiped down the tables in a few hours. Clearly lazy workers. There wasn't even a line.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Not one to really complain about a business, but this location has been slacking. Their customer service is terrible, especially that cashier chick that rushes everyone and is straight up rude. Their food is good, I guess. I'd rather just go to another location or eat something different. 

If you don't care about customer service, come here. If you like to be treated well by the place you bring business to, don't come here.

Seeing how much people complain about their customer service, I would think their management team would do something, but I guess they just don't care.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Bad customer service.  They bagged your food like stuffing thing at build a bear place and there was no apology what so ever.  I will not come back to this place.  Besides, the food portion is getting lesser now.  Overall, it is bad:-(<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">While I never claim to keep hold the sanctity of burritos as a truly ethnic sacred thing, especially since their creation wasn't all that long ago, I have no problem with this place serving up what is essentially white people Mexican food and there's nothing wrong with that. 

What there is something wrong with is the notion that an employee getting min. wage acting like you're robbing the business blind by asking for a proper spoon fulf of whatever it is your ordered. 

Take guac for example - That shit is expensive to get it added on to your dish, as guac generally is for some odd reason considering how many avocado trees we get in SoCal. But you put a little dollop on it and I mean little compared to the dude before me. How dare you get asked in a nice voice "Could you put a tad more on there please?" 

That's just a crime, ya' here. Same with everything else. They seem to be really tight with their... well, everything. Compared to other Chipotle, and I'll admit I haven't been to many, but compared to the others I have been to, this has to be the one where it seems every employee has had it beaten into them that giving too much of anything will get them put in the hot box outside. 

The food is as good as you can expect chipotle to be - but again, the service sucks. And when you go to a place that builds your meal like this in front of you, to not have some give or take or please the customer with a generous scoop will just build resentment.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Honestly.... I go to chipotle a lot and this location is my least favorite. Employees act like they don't understand basic answers, food portion is small... And really small compared to the other chipotles, and they almost charged me 2.50 for double chicken when I asked for a little bit more. I have gone back 4 times to see if it will get any better and it still is the same. Won't be going back to the Fullerton location again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I hit this place up usually once a week or every other week. I have become addicted. Realistically, the steak or chicken burritos will blow your taste buds away. The bowls are excellent too though, in case you are digging something different. Price is pretty good considering the size of the plate/burrito/meal/whatever.. Service is fast pace and they get that food made with style. Plenty of toppings, excellent shredded cheese, and friendly employees. They have alcohol available, and a decent soda vending machine too... The environment is nice, good seating (inside and out), unique taste in music, and its location is perfect as yogurt land is a couple doors down!... One thing I will say, they could work on cleaning the tables and floor a bit quicker. After just one family eating a table, there is quite a bit of "leftovers" surrounding that area/table. 

Id give a 4.5 if I could, but I will settle with a 4.0 :D<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Gotta offer the fajita veggies, yo.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't come here during lunch rush. ... they skimp on everything and it's so much less than normal...just because they are busy...that's not fair! We should be able to pay less...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As a CSUF student living in the area chipotle always hits the spot. The workers are nice and the food is even better!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food was good, I felt a bit rushed when choosing the food though but I guess that's because there were quite a few people behind me. I feel their food can use some seasoning, salt can go a long way<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Best of the best. I go to many chipotles and this one is the best. Apprentices are nice, friendly, and most important--they keep the line moving like a well oiled machine.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Employees are HORRIBLE. They don't talk to you when you are ordering. They just ignore you. When you ask for Guac we all know its additional cost and they give you an attitude if you ask them to do anymore than what they have to. I ordered a quesadilla for my son and literally the tortilla had NO cheese and was over cooked.  The lines are slower than all the other Chipotle's. I will not return to this location again.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I was here last week for lunch, and isn't the first time...I love their barbacoa burrito!!! They hook it up with lots of whatever u want...source cream, guacamole, sauce, u name it. It does get pretty busy for lunch hours, yet their service is fast and good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love love love chipotle 
When I first started coming here I could never finish a bowl in one sitting
Now I have noticed that they have smaller portions for the same price so that was upsetting 
Besides that this is a convenient location and does get busy but the employees work fast 
Overall good location<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like chipotle ONCE in awhile. And in terms of service & qualify of their food, it's pretty consistent, in a good way. But one thing I have to point out at this location is how stingy they serve your food. Chipotle is known for their generous portions, but not here. Their service isn't that great as well, as I've felt their people working their line rushing me along and not giving me time to *think* what I would like in my burrito--and get this, there was literally FIVE people in line...that's not even a lot. Literally rude  workers galore....I think they need to be retaught on basic customer-guest service. Maybe I'm a bit of a guest service snob because I've worked at Disneyland for so long, but this place needs some work put on.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I go to Chipotle all the time, & pretty much always consider it to be fantastic. But this will be the 9th or 10th time since going to this specific Chipotle that they have run out of SOMETHING. No matter the time or the ingredient, there's always something missing. At a certain point wouldn't they begin to learn just how much of something they need? And the frustrating part is the tone. None of the employees seem to care that there is a line to the door of people who are waiting on chicken. This Chipotle tastes just the same as the others, but be careful that you're not stuck in a never ending loop of "uh, yeah, that's gonna be a 10 minute wait."<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is so good but you people need to get it together! I ordered my food online to avoid the long line but you people aren't punctual pisses me off because I have stuff to do and places to be and your lack of keeping up messes everything up horrible service and the people need to be better under pressure especially the cashier!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Our office comes to this Chipotle often for lunch.  We use the online ordering system so that it makes the experience a little more convenient and a faster trip to pick everything up.  There was one time that one of my co-workers went to pick up the order and it took a little extra long to receive everything due to the current busyness of the pick up time and the manager offered us some additional drinks to thanks us for the patience while the order was made.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Since they taste the same everywhere to me and I love their food ... this is base on the service and portion ... this location sucks ... Portions are small .... we ordered 5 bowls and compare to the location in Walnut this location sucks. Would I come back - NO!!! I rather drive to Grand in Walnut for more food and friendly service<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Delicious food HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE 

Love the food here, but seriously, how horrible are the employees' lives to have to treat the customers so rudely! 

Definitely agree with the other ratings about the rudeness of the staff. 

Love the food, but won't bother eating there.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've never been more disappointed in a Chipotle.

Don't get me wrong. I LOVE Chipotle. I'm a huge fan. I used to eat it multiple times a week.

But man. This particular location is the WORST EVER.

I don't know what it is, but something is lacking. It just lacks flavor. And they are the stringiest with portions - I'm lucky if my bowl is half full, even when it's not busy. 

Also. One time I placed an online order and THEY EXCLUDED THE STEAK. WHAT. YES. They literally left out the meat. This place is a sloppy operations nightmare and needs to figure it out and get it together because this is just unacceptable.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">To be honest, I'm never a huge fan of Chipotle. I think the salad is overly priced and the lines are a bit too long. I was a bit peeved when one of the workers asked me, 'that's all that you're getting?' in a snooty voice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">HORRIBLE! RUDE AND PATRONIZING! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! BEWARE I went with a coupon and they would not validate because it was "fake" when I got it off of their website and when I tried to show the cashier on my phone she would not even look at it or consider it.. Worst experience ever and I will never be going back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This has to be the worst chipotle I've been to. They just seem undertrained or just don't put pride in they're work. Maybe it's a bad night but unacceptable kom the less<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Every time I have gone the employees serving your food are always disrespectful. They always have an attitude. I purposely drive to other locations to avoid their terrible service.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">As a major chipotle lover, the parking lots here sucks, but it's worth it to come here! :) 
It was in the middle of the lunch rush and they ran out of chicken for maybe 5 min! 
the manager Chewey gave me a free entree card, apologizing for the wait and inconvenience! Not that I minded at all for waiting, but the fact that he went above and beyond, out of his way to even address the wait, was very much appreciated! 
The workers here are always cheerful and never seem annoyed with my pickiness, which is nice! :)
Great customer service & delicious food here! :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Given that I study at CSUF, I tend to stop by here occasionally. So a couple things you need to know. There will be a line...and the employees will sometimes rush you, which is understandable, I mean hey their busy. But that fast pace service pays off because they always got their veggies and meats fresh and ready to serve.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Double steak.  F-yeah!  Chipotle is my favorite.

This location is always super busy though and the parking is a nightmare so you have to go at off hours.  I don't even know how many times I've pulled into this parking lot and circled right on out after seeing the crazy line or from just not finding parking.  Ummm...can I get a Valet please?  

I guess what I'm really saying is that I just want Chipotle all to myself!  

Muahahaha!  ;)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Its a shame that this place is going to be popular no matter what anyone says because its so close to Cal State Fullerton, because what I saw there last time made me want to call the health department. I've only lived here for a few years but there is such a high turnover of employees that you can count on there being a new set of faces every few weeks. It shows in the often rude employees, their gross behavior (wiping guacamole onto my burrito with your hand?!?!(BARF!!) the fact that this is the only chipotle ive been to with small portions, and the trash strewn across the floor. Yes folks thats right, a whole trash can was tipped over behind the counter where food was being prepared for all to see. I mentioned this to one of the workers there, who brushed me off saying "yeah somebody well get to that". I know they get busy, but the weird thing is, it wasnt even that busy when I was there! Needless to say I couldnt even finish my burrito that night thinking about this. Dont bother going here, its disgusting!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I've been to this Chipotle many times and have had pretty good experience over all. They usually have a long line since they are located right between two colleges.

This review, though, is for an online order that I made. We know that they usually have long lines so we decided to order online to avoid having to wait. The online ordering is nice because you can put all the things you would like on, plus write any extra comments to insure that your order comes out just the way you like it.

BUT, the problem I have found out with this trip is that the employees do not read the comments at all. So almost all of our orders came out wrong. In addition, we showed up to the Chipotle at the time that they had put for pick up, to find that they just had the order sitting next to the register. It hadn't been made or anything and they weren't very busy at the time. 

We weren't to happy that we then had to wait anyways in the end, but they did give us 2 free drinks, plus a very small discount.

All in all it wasn't the best trip and experience using the online ordering. I would not recommend the online ordering to anyone, especially if you have a complicated order.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review is in regards to my visit on 10/11/14 at 1:30 PM. Let me start by saying I usually love chipotle, been going there for years and I have never had a problem with chipotle except for at this location.  The line was short so that was good (probably because the employees scared off all of this locations customers) but when I got to the front all I got was disrespect, rude attitudes and poor treatment from three of the four employees who served me. When I got to the first guy (blonde with red facial hair) he asked what I wanted and I said a "burrito", he said "what do you want?" And I repeated louder this time, "a burrito", then he replied "sir, which one do you want, a burrito, a bowl, a taco or a salad? (At this point he has me almost yelling) I say "I would like a burrito, please" and he turned around and laughed with one of his coworkers.  He then whispered in another one of his coworkers ears something and she (Hispanic girl with bulgy eyes, first in the serving line) changed spots with him and he went to the back.. It was at this point that I noticed they were playing games with me which I found very offensive.  She asked what kind of rice I wanted, I said brown and she put white rice, I corrected her mistake and told her I wanted brown rice and she put brown rice on top of the white rice. Then, she asked if I wanted pinto beans or black beans, which she actually got right, yay pinto... I then asked for fajitas and she went out of her way to grab raw bell peppers out of a container behind her and threw them on my burrito even though there was cooked peppers right in front of her.. She then asked what type of meat I would like and I replied chicken and she went ahead and put half a scoop of steak on the burrito, which I told her I wanted chicken and she replied " if I give you a scoop of chicken too ill have to charge you extra for 2x the meat" so I said forget it and moved on.  The rest of the process was as normal so I can't complain besides charging me for steak even though I didn't order that but I just thought I'd bring this game your employees are playing to your attention since it is very unprofessional.  I didn't do anything to provoke the actions taken by your employees and they decided to serve me poorly on purpose, they should be fired for this kind of treatment towards the customer.


Won't be returning here.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location is usually pretty busy, I'm guessing due to it being so close to Cal State Fullerton. Service is usually quick and friendly. It is Chipotle though. It's decent and reasonably priced, but I always feel so damn bloated afterwards.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The quality taste is what you expect from the Chipotle. That is why I give it just one star. But there's a common theme about this particular Chipotle:

THE SERVICE SUCKS! 

Stand in a long line - Tortilla girl mumbles something about rice/beans - Next bitch gives you the most stingiest serving of ingredients - Then you top it off with the a bullshit smile from the manager.

Am I the only one? or I'm getting this service because I am Asian? Nah, service sucks.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Just like any other Chipotle, food quality wise...except for the horrible service. 

Seriously, I went there with my boyfriend for Sunday night dinner and we both got the burrito bowls. My boyfriend went first and he got everything he asked for.

I went next, and the RUDEST lady behind the counter asked what salsa I wanted. 
I always get the pico de gallo, cheese, corn and lettuce with the hot sauce on the side. Before I could even finish, she adds the pico de gallo and cheese and literally throws my food towards the cashier. THEN, I was like umm, can I get lettuce and corn? She looks at me like I just insulted her, adds it and throws it again. I ask if I can get the hot sauce on the side, and at this point I must have really pushed the button (asking for what I wanted on my bowl and all), she gives me a dirty look and since the sauce has a lid she SLAMS it on the counter. I looked at my boyfriend like WTF?!!

Anyway, we paid and as I started eating, I noticed that there was barely any pico de gallo on mine and shit ton on my boyfriends.  The difference between our two bowls was night and day. 

Reading the other yelp reviews, seems like they need a new staff, cause this chick was HORRIBLE.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Comparing to other locations, service at this particular location is horrendous. To the girl that served me last week around 7pm, please consider a new career, because customer service is not your forte, rude girl girl. Her service was so bad, that even after an entire week later, I still recall it. I'll go more into details about the service later on. First, let's just talk about the food.

One of my co-workers (he's mexican), always give me crap for eating at Chipotle because it's not "authentic" Mexican food. Uh, hello? Look at me, do I look Mexican to you? Do you actually think I would know the difference between "authentic" and non-authentic Mexican food? Come on, let's get real here. I don't care if it's not authentic, if the food taste good, I'll eat it. So, with that being said. I love eating at Chipotle. I always  get their steak tacos (which comes in 3).

Alright now onto their shitty service. Right off the bat, I already got a bad vibe from this shitty server. I would have given this place a 4 stars for their food, but since I got treated like shit, instead of 4 stars, I'm giving it 1 star.

"What do you want?" - bitchy server

"Hi, can I please get the steak tacos"? (even though I was taken back by her greetings, I just figured, alright, maybe this bitch is having an "off" day, so I'll just be nice)

She then started placing the steaks on the tacos. I kid you not, she gave me literally THREE pieces of meat on each tacos. Um, is this girl serious?

"Excuse me, can you give me a little more meat please?"

"Whaaaat?! You want more?!" - bitchy server; yes, I want more meat. You gave me 3 pieces of meat. Just because I'm skinny don't assume that I eat like an anorexic person. No, I have an appetite of a fat person, so give me my meat!

Anyway, I really like their sauces, so aside from having the mild/medium sauce put into my tacos, I also asked for extras on the side.

"Oh, and can you please give me 2 extra sauces on the side?"

"Uh, I already put sauce in the tacos" - bitchy server

At this point, I've had enough of her bullshit, so I responded "Yes, I'm very well aware of that fact, that's why I asked for EXTRA sauce ON THE SIDE."

I looked at the customer beside me, and we both shook our heads. Seriously, it's not proper etiquette at all. 

Yelpers, there are a million other Chipotle locations. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this location like a Plague. No one deserves to be treated like crap.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location is right off a college campus so Of course it's going to be packed during the week. I came with the understanding that services is slow to begin with. But when I'm about 4 ppl away from payin the line gets held up for 5 minute bc the only 1/8 employees who knows how to fold goes on break. So 7 employees weren't capable of folding burritos? Poor management. Either train more ppl or schedule accordingly<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love Chipotle. Especially at this location my burritos are always huge and they always need to double wrap mine since I pretty much get everything. Guacamole, Lettuce, sour cream,cheese rice beans and chicken.  Food taste great. It's always a bit of a way due to all the stupid college kids. That's the downside
 of this place. There are a bunch of college kids running around and acting a fool. The hell you think this is pre-school sit down and eat your food don't hulahoop in front of me ya loser. If your a college kid that hangs around here I hate you and leave me alone.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I think I'll stick to my chipotle in Anaheim (Euclid and Ball rd) better portions for your money...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">*Pretty long line, but it moves fairly quickly.

*Really skimpy portions!  I swear, my bowl was half way filled -_-

*Tastes the same as any other Chipotle.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Coming from someone who has worked at a chipotle, this chipotle has no sense of urgency, which was something that my previous chipotle was keen on. You can come in and wait for 15 minutes before starting to order. If the employees had the sense of urgency that was taught to us at our chipotle in SD, it would take less than half the time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Really good food, just be prepared if you're going during lunch hours- its super packed! Still, that's to be expected. This is a very good Chipotle!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">No human being should EVER eat at this Chipotle. My boyfriend and brother decided to have lunch here and let me just start that the staff is very rude to the other staff and customers. They are very stingy with adding the food you want. What's the point of asking what you want if the staff won't provide it? They were ridiculous and need to be trained in customer service. I would let it all go if there food wasn't so VILE! It literally tastes disgusting to the human tongue. My brother immediately got diarrhea and my boyfriend came home with food poisoning and hasn't stopped throwing up because of undercooked steak. So if you want disgusting food with terrible service and food poisoning then chipotle is the spot for you!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The nightmare begins from the moment they ask you what you want to order. I always get a chicken burrito bowl. Out of all the Chipotle branches that I've been to, this is the only one where they don't give 2 scoops of rice - they barely give you 1. After the rice, all hell breaks loose. If you don't speak up you WILL get screwed over. They don't bother asking if you want fajita peppers, and will quickly proceed to throw on very stingy amounts of chicken and beans. God forbid you ask for more. After that, your bowl gets pushed further down the line to the point of no return. This is for the blonde tattooed bitch in charge of the salsas - DON'T RUSH ME. I don't know where they find the people who work there, but they really should throw them all out. I would rather drive a lil further to the Brea branch and be treated like a human.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Chipotle. Even though I am Mexican, and it's not authentic (I know!) it's yummy!
As others mentioned, it seems the portions are getting slimmer. Today I ordered a chicken bowl and was given less than a spoonful. Why? Because the container was empty. How is that my fault?! My husband asked for the same thing and they had to get a new, fresh container. Did they put more on mine? Of course not. I had to ask and got a pissed look by the server. 
People mention that the staff is rude. I think I know why. The trainers are rude to the trainees. The cashier was getting trained and took the initiative to ask if we wanted chips. The person training her put her palm up and told her, "You NEED to be quiet and listen". Wow!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">All I can really say is that the team located at this Chipotle has poor customer service, mainly the girls. I'm not one to complain about anything but ya'll should be more respectful towards customers. Yes, I'm a nobody but you might just run into a somebody one day and then you'll be shitting bricks. 

I recommend the manager of this location to pay better attention to the way the team provides a service. Almost everyone here is rude when they have no reason to be. If you hate your job so bad then it's simple, DON'T WORK HERE! Thank you!

Regards, 
A concerned citizen<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What do those chickens eat? Why don't they eat vegetarian now? I will stick w the barbacoa thank you!
The sign posted states:
The chicken we are serving is raised without the use of antibiotics.  But that's not quite good enough.  Soon we will have a supply from chickens that were also fed a vegetarian diet...

EW!!!!!!!!!!!

On the brighter side this location serves margaritas, which go great w the chips and guacamole! I love love love the barbacoa here. In fact, I only order the barbacoa.  Tried the chicken. It had no salt/pepper and really creeped me out despite the sign.  I couldn't get passed the sign.  What did it mean???
Staffers are fast and friendly. Love the patio. You will find me here most FIESTA FRIDAYS :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am definitely a fan of Chipotle, but needless to say every restaurant is different. 
I do like this location since it is conveniently located near my home and csuf. 
The staff here is just okay. The personalities you get here can be yay or nay. But the food makes up for it. 

I really wish they were more generous with there protein it seems like they can be a bit stingy. When you ask for a little bit more they are hesitant  to give it to you. 

Cons: crowded & small 
Pros: quick lunch & close to school<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Always good food and consistent  quality.  Many reviews already so not to repeat.  This location's food portion is not as generous as others, but still, gets me stuffed every time.  When it is packed, it can be a little noisy, the sound absorption is not good.  They should install some acoustic panels.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I had initially tried Chipotle when it first opened and just thought this was the worst concept ever.  Why would anyone eat here when there's plenty of much better and more authentic Mexican restaurants close by.  

Then one day, our 5 year old just couldn't hold it any longer while on one of our Yogurtland visits so we snuck over to Chipotle to borrow their facilities.  As we half trotted through the restaurant, the size of their burritos caught my attention.  These things were huge . . and it looked good too.  So shortly after, we went for dinner and, much to my surprise, it was quite good.  Though not really authentic, the food was fresh and the portion was so generous.  I like the variety of fresh salsa.  The rice reminds me of Wahoo.   

I agree the location is not the most convenient.  With Chipotle, Pick-up-Stix, Yogurtland, and Starbucks, this is probably the busiest strip mall in the area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I LOVE CHIPOTLE!

BUT the service sucks (compared to other locations).

I have to constantly REPEAT my order on several occasions. Sure, it gets crowded most of the time, but when it isn't, it's like they don't care to take my order when I'm the only person in line!

Service sucks, but this will not stop my love for Chipotle. I just wish there was another location in this area.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am a HUGE fan of chipotle (especially the barbacoa) BUT this is by far the worst order I've ever had. The service isn't that great either...I put a smile on and greeted the first girl but she still had a "get out of my face chick" face on...and let me tell ya, that is not a very good impression! 

They've been giving smaller portions lately, but it didn't bother me. I'm glad they're now serving brown rice! Pretty cool alternative. 

THE WORST PART: I live about 20 minutes away from this Chipotle. Just wanted to get a late dinner from being at school all day. I was really looking forward to this meal and right when I opened my barbacoa bowl...I see a BUG moving around!!! I freaked out and did a double take (making sure it was a bug and not my lettuce just falling around) And I was SURE that it was a bug... 

I have officially lost my appetite and craving for any chipotle and to top it all off, I just wasted $6+ on a meal that contained a bug..DISGUSTING.

I'm not trying to SCARE you guys off and tell you not to ever get chipotle again, but whenever you decide to get some chipotle, double-check your food for bugs...AND if you have the time and chance to (if you find a critter in your food) go complain.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Slow service. Rude staff! They are skimpy on food. Go to the brea location.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Chipotle! It's a healthier alternative to the generic greasy burrito. I like that you have the option to choose between brown and white rice. Whichever one you choose, it is still super yummy! :)

The service was great when I went. They were patient with me when I was a little indecisive of what I wanted in my bowl. In case you've never gone to Chipotle before, it kinda has that Subway concept where you walk in and tell them what you want step-by-step. I love places like this because you literally make your food how you want it done. And if it doesn't taste good, then that you're own fault for telling them to make it like that, lol. Harsh, but it's true!

My only thing I have to nitpick about is the price. It can get pricey, but for the quality and service, I understand it's a little more. I got a steak bowl, my boyfriend got a burrito, and we wanted chips and salsa on the side and it ended up being $15. But with how full you're going to be when you're done eating, that $15 is worth it!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">With this place being so close to CSUF, you're bound to run into some snotty, self entitled kids.  If you can look past that, and you have the patience to wait in long lines- then this Chipotle is for you.  This is definitely one of the busier ones I've ever been to, but the staff moves quickly and pays attention to your order.  Parking can be tricky sometimes, so ride your bike or walk there if you can.  It might just be me, but sometimes it seems like they have their radio cranked up higher than other Chipotles.  

That said- I will be back.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This review is NOT about the quality of the food because we all know how good Chipotle taste.

This is a review about the location in general.

Went on a Thursday afternoon around 2:30pm and it was PACKEDD!!! I thought the "typical lunch hour" was over so there wouldn't be that much of a wait. Boy, was I wrong...Not only was the parking lot small as hell, but parking spaces were hard to find! I was lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time as someone was backing up.

I've read previous reviews that the line CAN be super long and would wrap around the store. I saw that as I arrived but I was prepared for it so no surprises on my part. I waited a good 10minutes before I was served.

I understand this place can constantly be crowded with CSUF students and all, but damn....DO THEY REALLY HAVE TO RUSH MY ORDER LIKE I'M A NUISANCE TO THEM!?!?!!? First they got my order wrong, I specifically said NO BEANS on my steak bowl ($6.63 with tax)...I don't have a shy, timid voice....I spoke in a tone loud enough for them to hear, and they STILL put beans on my bowl!!!!!!! So they had to start my bowl over again.

Long story short:
-they were super stingy on my rice! ONE FUCKIN SCOOP!!!?? Are you serious!?!?! Other Chipotle fills up my bowl with rice!!!!
-super stingy on almost everything!!!!
-do they hire "difficult in hearing" employees!? They can't hear me if their lives depended on it. Yes, I want pico de gallo...yes I also want the corn too. And lettuce. Yes, I want the lettuce also..this one right here. YES!!!!! THAT LETTUCE!!!!!  -__- ugh. annoying.
-kept on getting rushed like a herd of cows.


I LOVE Chipotle, but I wouldn't go to this one again...my first experience was irritating!!! Even though it's right by my school...no thanks...I rather wait to eat lunch when I get home or just eat somewhere else in general.

</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love their food, just wish the portion sizes were more for the cost.  Rice isn't expensive.   I always get the veggie bowl with the free guacamole.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is always busy with College students.  I knew if I wanted to just run in and out it was going to be difficult depending on the time.  The food was always good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is great but the restaurant itself is dirty, they never have chips on display, bathrooms are dirty, the staff is okay, some have attitude problems.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">consistent
fast
friendly

and this location prob has the most seats in the complex -- the parking lot gets full during the week at lunch so carpool!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is pretty similar no matter the location. It's always delicious! I like to get a bowl and ask for tortilla. The line gets long around lunch time because it's right next to CSUF and Troy High School.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Simple, quick, the new brown rice is a great option. Easier to get in and out of when the colleges are closed or during intersession. Parking lot can be a challenge at times.
My food of choice is the burrito, with black beans and brown rice, steak, hot salsa and cheese.  Since switching to the brown rice, I do not experience the food coma (insulin spike), that I used to experience with the white rice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is the Chipotle I frequent the most and I am usually never unsatisfied.

Although I have noticed they are putting less and less rice and beans. I usually have to ask for more.

No complaints :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">By far the worst chipotle I've been too.  I get that your busy but be prepared.  I get to the front of the line order a chicken burrito and am told they are our of chicken its gonna be a 6 min wait which I was okay with.  20 mins later its finally ready and I was the first one ready but the last to get my food. The only person who was nice and apologized was the cashier everyone else was rude.  After waiting 20 mins and thinking I was gonna have fresh chicken the burrrito was cold.  No not going back<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Chipotle! I always get the veggie bowl or the veggie burrito since it comes with guacamole automatically. I love their chips too since they put some lime juice on them.

My favorite toppings are the corn salsa, the mild salsa, the medium salsa, some sour cream, lettuce, cheese, rice, fajita (peppers/onions) and no beans.

Service is quick and they're really friendly. They never complain if you ask for more or less of something.

The prices aren't bad at all either! Prices went up recently, but only by like.. 10-20 cents or so!

Can get REALLY busy because of CSUF and Western State being so close. I tend to go right when it opens so the wait won't be so long. But even if the line is long, it tends to go fast. It's only been really slow once when someone was buying for her entire workplace or something (8+ items).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This location messes up my order all the time. 
My order is always: 
Steak bowl to go, no lettuce, & a side of chips. 

How hard is that?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Chipotle, I really like that there's a fast food option that is relatively healthy and uses (some) organic products and chicken that doesn't have added growth hormones or antibiotics.  This location was great.  I walked in around noon and the line was huge.  But they were really fast and efficient, and I was able to get my food in just a few minutes.  And it was delicious!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is my default, go-to eatery.  When I'm so hungry that I really have no preference about where to eat, yet I want something good...(come on Yelpers, I know we all like to try new things, but honestly we all have our go-to places)...this is where I pick.  Hands-down.

I usually go to the Chipotle in Orange at the Village, but I found that this one in Fullerton is a little better.  Cleaner, better service, and they give a little more food :)

In general, you really can't go wrong with Chipotle.  They have high-quality food that always tastes delicious.  Something about their guacamole and sour cream is just addicting.  New to Chipotle?  Try the BURRITO BOWL.  You'll be overwhelmed the regular burrito if it's your first time.  (ha)  It's packed...and if you get just about everything like I do, you won't be able to fit your mouth around it.  But if you like a challenge, go for it.  ;)

Oh, and they have good ethics too.  Read about them on their website!  They follow the statement "Food With Integrity" which is always a big plus.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love chipotle, I was going to lake Elsinore so I stopped by this location instead of other fast foods. I loved the atmosphere, the food, the cleanliness pretty much every thing was top notch. Not to mention the burrito was stuffed and fabulous.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is not as good as it gets in terms of Mexican food, but their burritos and bowls are pretty good.

My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl. You get to choose white rice, pinto/black beans, green bell peppers & onions, cheese, lettuce, guacamole (extra charge), and salsa (pico de gallo, corn salsa, or hot red salsa). 
The guacamole is amazing here! I also like to get their tortilla chips...tastes so good with the guacamole :)

The burritos come with any of the things above as well. I usually like my burritos with steak instead of chicken though. The steak is OK for me, but the chicken is always a hit. 

Around lunch time, the line can get very long, but don't worry, the line moves super fast! If the line is at the door, you will be ordering in less than 5 minutes.

Service is always great. They always serve good portions of the food, and if you want something more or less, they happily oblige. And wow are they quick at making your bowls and burritos!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I often go here during my breaks at school but seriously they have down-graded!! So stingy on their ingredients and give u hardly any in my bowl/burrito. Bummer since I used to be addicted to this yumminess. But now, I rather go to Pick Up Stix next door and get my money's worth. So longggg Chipotle~<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Chipotle! This place is bigger than some of the other Chipotle locations I've been to. As far as the food goes...nothing bad to say. 

The only bad thing is that if you go during lunch time...then expect to wait in a very long line with all the college students!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Guac = WIN

Bottomline: Not much to say, except it gets packed most of the time because of it's close proximity to campus. 

Sidenote: After being on a 12-hour fast and finishing some trials for studies on campus, this has saved my butt on more than one occasion.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This chipotle mexican grill is excellent I used to work right next to it at the papa Johns pizza. But I could always count on chipotle to come thru when I went on break there fast and there burritos are fantastic!!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Their services are always great. Since this place is always busy, they always provide fresh products. Chicken is my favorite! Yum!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's funny because I tried Chipotle's burrito when it first opened in Costa Mesa years ago. I was not impressed.  I finally decided to give it another go and I was amazed at how simple their menu is. I tried their barbacoa burrito. It was HUGE filled with fresh ingredients. Wow! It was so delicious! I can't believe that I've been missing out on this place for so long. The prices are super reasonable also. A week later I went back to try their steak burrito. Even better. It's interesting how I can completely devour the monster burrito but not feel "bleh!' It's a very comfortable full feeling. Makes sense?<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">They margaritas are tops! super strong for a fast food place. 

No - It's not authentic Mexican food. So? go somewhere else for that. Honestly it's a huge fast food chain how authentic do you want it. Do you hate Taco Bell and Del Taco too. if so get the stick out of your ass.  

No - McDonalds does not own it anymore. 

Yes - Chipotle is still the bomb.com  All these low ratings are annoying me.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love this place! I'd eat here everyday if I could. The burritos are huge and taste awesome. It can get pricey if you add stuff but I think it's worth it.

Went there yesterday and they were playing Brazilian music... caught me off guard but it was cool.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Depending on the time of day this place can get packed ! You have people in the area plus students ! In my personal opinion Chipolte is just okay. Not bad not great. I think they fall somewhere in the middle. 

TIPS you can ask for a quesadilla even though it is not on the menu ! I recommend the steak one !<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I use to love this Chipotle but recently I've noticed it has been getting worse each time I visit. My main issue is when I ask for extra salsa or lettuce, I've been getting employees that sigh or roll their eyes at me, or even worse ignore me and pretend they didn't hear me. I would never have to ask for extra of anything before but I've noticed for the past two years they've been cutting their portion size down quite a bit.  I payed the additional fee for guac on the side, but i got a container filled less than half way. EXCUSE ME but.. I'm PAYING for the guac and I expect it to be filled full or nearly full, not less than half. I asked TWO times to fill up the container of guac all the way and the response I got was the add it to the halfway point, at which point I asked AGAIN to fill it up more and finally after the second time, I was so frustrated I walked away with a container filled up to MAYBE 60%. 
 
That is NOT the way to run your business. By the time I finished ordering for myself and two other people, we were so frustrated we decided we were done. So basically because Chipotle wants to be stingy with a few cents worth of food, you've lost not only me but two other devoted Chiptole fans that would frequent this particular Chipotle at least a few times a month. GOOD JOB! Makes sense right? save 50 cents, lose 3 customers that spend about 10 dollars each time. We will be going to the new Chipotle in Brea to avoid these issues in the future.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love the steak crispy tacos! They are seriously delicious!
Sometimes it is hard to find parking and the line can get long, but it moves relatively fast. The wait is definitely worth it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I eat here 4 times a day...

Everytime, it feels like the first...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I go to CSUF so there is a Chipotle right across the street and I go here at times to eat for lunch or dinner.  The bowls here are great! I normally get the chicken bowl with everything on it besides.... beans! =X . The burritos here are pretty decent as well but I like the bowls because its unique, in terms of not many other places offering this style of food.  Its healthy i think or it feels healthy... 

pz<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Like caviar? No, then good, because you won't find it at Chipotle. However, they do offer some awesome customizable burritos, soft tacos, burrito bowls, and more.

My usual order consists of a chicken burrito loaded with seasoned rice, black beans, pizza (just seeing if you're paying attention), a mix of salsas, corn, cheese, and sour cream. If I'm feeling sexy, or just want to get the staff out of their usual burrito and burrito bowl grind, I opt for the soft tacos with about the same combo of ingredients as above.

Whatever you choose, stop by this location if you want the perfect combination of being minutes away from a university (CSUF) and seconds from Starbucks (almost next door).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I go here all the time because I live close by... and in comparison to other Chipotle restaurants this one is sort of questionable when it comes to the portions they put on your burrito/bowl or whatever you order. They are so small! The staff at other places loads up on rice and beans for you, here they try to fuck you over a little bit for what you are paying. So you end up always having to ask for EXTRA rice, EXTRA beans, ... and still won't get a decent sized portion. I'm pretty sure they are well aware of this. The staff is friendly, but I sometimes drive up to Brea instead just to not deal with their midget sized portions.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I LOVE Chipotle but I have to agree with other posters, the parking in this location is awful!  It's very busy and there are several places in this strip mall where people go to "hang out" for a long time.  (Coffee shop, Yougut place... all with free WiFi I think) so there is never much parking. 
If I have a Chipotle craving we order online and try to go at an off-peak time.  Sometimes it's just worth the hassle!  : -  )<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Excellent location and good food!

Despite the long line, its often not long before you are done paying for your food and finding a seat.

The quality of the food is excellent, like most of other Chipotle locations.

They have cut down by about 20%-30% on the quantity of the meat they use over the past 1-2 years.  Also, the gaucomole is overpriced; I still get it because it tastes so good.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chicken Tacos- 
Corn Tortilla
Lettuce
Cheese
Chicken 
Corn Salsa

That's all I need, and it satisfies every time.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is great. Not much needs to be said about it. I almost always get a chicken burrito, with black beans, both the corn salsa and the hot salsa, and cheese. Sometimes I ask for extra rice (which they're happy to give you for no charge) but if they put too much in it dulls the flavors. The rice by itself is actually pretty great, though, it's cooked with lime or something. I've tried a few other options, but I always go back to the chicken burrito. 

The prices for the burritos and other stuff I think are pretty fair. They vary by location - in NYC they're almost $8 - but in general, SoCal Chipotle locations (including this one) are quite reasonable. However, I don't feel the same way about the extras. The chips are good, but too expensive. The extra charge for guacamole is... a lot. I can't even remember what other stuff they have because I'd never order it. Soda is reasonable (just get the small one and refill it a couple of times while you're there).

This particular location gets rather busy if you go at the wrong time, when CSUF is in session. The parking lot is pretty cramped too, although generally you should always be able to find a spot. The service here is pretty good, but can be spotty (this is true in general for Chipotle). In all this is a good location, but not great. I can't give it five stars because I've been to some really great Chipotles (including the aforementioned NYC locations).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Another Chipotle, under my belt (quite literally). I am so burrito-whipped, it's almost not funny. Before a Disneyland adventure, my friends wanted breakfast and asked for my vote. I said without hesitation, "Chipotle." It's my first answer in any situation, my go-to-guy, my number one quick-comfort food. I want to get a Chipotle guacamole spa treatment, and rub it all over my body. And by "rub it all over my body", I mean devour it like a starving vagrant. PROTIP: Make a chip-burrito by munching down the delicios chips on your burrito. Makes chip-sandwiches look like child's play.
This branch is filled with friendly staff and the embience you expect from a tin-wrapped burrito joint. Loverly, loverly, indeed.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is GREAT!!i came here saterday after my sister finished taking her placement test at csuf.  The line was long but it went by pretty fast.  I got the chicken rice bowl and it was amazing.  The only complaint was that we were charged for an extra drink.  It was no biggie we just told the cashier and he gave us a bag of chips instead.  Definitly will be back!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Chipotle was efficient and the food was awesome. I always enjoy their veggie burrito with chips!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is NOT fast food.  It's lunch time and I want my chicken burrito bowl.  

My buddy called me out, "Hey, didn't you give up fast food for Lent?"
"Yea.... what's your point?"
"You can't eat here."  

NOOOOOOOO!!  Did I really doom myself into 40 days of no ginormous foil wrapped burritos?  I had to think fast.  "Let's define fast food, shall we?  I only count places with a drive-thru so Chipotle counts as a sit-down restaurant."  He said fine.  Haha.

Service is quick here and sometimes it does feel like a fast food joint, but the ingredients are fresher and taste a bit better, maybe healthier?  I usually get my chicken burrito bowl topped with fajita onions and bell peppers, all the salsas, sour cream, cheese, black beans and sometimes guac.  Insanely delicious!

I noticed the other patrons mixing different types of meat.  Interesting.  I'll have to try that next time.  Also, if you're in a rush, you can place your order online and cut the long lunch line.  I always crack up when you point your arrow over the toppings you want and the female voice with an accent says the name out loud.  You also get to name your burrito online.  I usually go with Bob the Burrrrrrito!

Service is efficient and resembles an assembly line.  ~$6 for lunch.  I'm happy I resolved my Lent issue and can continue to enjoy the chicken bowl.  Nom nom nom.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is overall very delicious and your experience will depend on who makes your burrito.  Some of the servers will fill it up and you will be full for days.  others make it rather wimpy and you are hungry and hour later.  I don't like spicey food so the carnitas is the way to go for me.  I don't think they should charge almost $2 for a litle guacamole when avocados are 2 for $1 at the store so I think that is a rip-off.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Four stars for being a Chipotle. Minus one star for serving up old guacamole that gave me indigestion.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I hate this chipotle. I usually love eating at chipotle, but this one pisses me off.  The workers are rude, they get pist if you ask for more rice, and the portions are smaller than the other chipotle. Yah im fucking asian, I like rice, dont give me attitude if i want rice. O and the food is always cold.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food is amazing here but it is quite slow to get it.  Usually is a long a line to get your food.  Could have to do with the fact that CSUF is so close.

Anyways, I eat here 3 days a week. lol  Its delicious!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Don't get me wrong with the 3 star review--I freaking love the flavors at this Chipotle.  BUT, this location has been really inconsistent with how much they pack the burritos and burrito bowls from patron to patron.  Some people get a lot (not me!) and some people are given a little (ME!).  I may be a girl, but I can eat, and when I want my Chipotle, I WANT MY CHIPOTLE!

Also, customers here aren't the brightest bulbs in the pack.  This couple behind me made me laugh as they discussed, "What is barbacoa?"  Of course the dude was trying to impress the girl: "I took Spanish a few years ago, but I'm thinking it means 'barbecued'"  D-bag, the menu says it's braised, not grilled!  Come here for a good laugh.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love all Chipotles, but have different experiences at all of them. This particular one has great food. It's always fresh and the employees are very friendly, for the most part. 

But, the ONLY complaint I have is that they are rather slow. The line is always long and takes forever. I have been to a TON of different Chipotles and most of them, the line moves fast. But, not this one. There was even one time when I was ready to pay and I had to stand there (at the cash register) for like FIVE min, waiting to pay. Everyone in line behind me was getting so frustrated. The lady finally came out from the kitchen to ring me, and everyone else up. It was kind of annoying.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place is usually crowded for lunch.  This place seems dirtier and louder than other Chipotle's I've been to.  I do like the Chipotle concept though... it's like subway style where you get to choose your own toppings, but with a Burrito!

This specific Chipotle is just too dirty for my appetite.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have discovered the secret of how to finally attain Chipotle Burrito Bowl Nirvana! 

You ask for not one, but TWO SCOOPS OF CORN SALSA. Thee end.

You can thank me by making out a check to Jonathan N. ;)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I wish I could hate Chipotle because it is part of the mainstream American big-business chain gang, even though they claim to be different and get their food from different avenues..blah blah blah. Aren't they owned by McDonalds or something? That being said....the barbacoa salad or barbacoa bowl is amazing. Really, my tastebuds dance just thinking of barbacoa with salsa. I try to limit my patronage to chain places, but Chipotle, I can't resist you. Just say no to the chips and guacamole...they are kind of a rip off. Service is whatever here. Not bad, not mind blowing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">solid chipotle location. Nothing fancy, typical long line around dinner time and slow-ish staff putting together burritos. I like that the staff really listened to what I said I wanted on my burrito, its not rocket science, but often times people working in this industry ignore the specifics which can make or break your meal. Lots of college aged kids given its proximity to CSUF<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I ate here again today and I got sick. Unhappy<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great food, not cheap.

Chipotle is my favorite of all the Mexican-like chains out there.... followed by Wahoos and Baja Fresh.  I like Wahoos a lot and Baja Fresh is good, but Chipotle has the best flavor of all of them. Their corn salsa is my favorite thing on the Chicken burrito....mmmm...

Parking sucks like nothing has ever sucked before, but it's worth it if you can find a spot to park. Definitely a great alternative to Pick up Stix.... Only problem is some of the people (customers) can be rude.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love Chipotle, but this is the worst experience I've ever had at one of their restaurants.  This was my first (and will be my only) time visiting this particular location.  My initial impression was positive: this is bigger than many of the Chipotle restaurants I frequent, and although the line was long (as it usually is at any of their locations), it seemed to move fairly quickly.

I'm a big fan of the off-menu quesarrito, so I ordered it like normal and they nodded as if this was a usual request and began preparing it.  For those who have never had a quesarrito, the usual procedure is that a normal quesadilla is made and then opened to be filled with the regular burrito contents.  At this location, once they piled the cheese on the tortilla (to be fair, it was a generous amount of cheese) they asked what type of meat I wanted.  I told them, and they put that on as well.  This is not entirely out of the ordinary; I've been to a couple locations that press the meat and cheese together and it's actually pretty good (although you almost always end up getting less meat than normal).  After the meat, they asked what kind of salsa I wanted.  At this point I stopped them and asked if they were going to press it first, figuring they probably just forgot what I'd ordered.  They said they press it at the end.  Maybe that's how some people like it, and far be it from me to tell anyone how to order their food, but I like the salsa, lettuce, etc to be cold when I start to eat, so I asked them (politely) to please press it before they continued.  They flat out refused, stating that it was "against policy," despite the fact that I've made this identical order at least seven other locations, none of which have pressed the quesarrito as the final step. I went along with their way making it and begrudgingly paid.

The resulting creation ended up being less than half the size of a normal burrito (to aid in pressing it at the end, I imagine), and was oozing its contents from at least three separate tears at different points in the tortilla (this normally doesn't happen with quesarritos, and when it does, most employees have the courtesy to double-wrap).  I've never had a Chipotle refuse to prepare my food like that.  If this had been my first Chipotle experience, I doubt I'd ever go back to any of their locations in the future.

Avoid this particular location at all costs!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can never go wrong with Chipotle, especially one that's only two doors down from a yogurtland and around the corner of a starbucks. I recommend getting the salad dressing for your burrito bowl and getting tortillas on the side just in case you wanna make your bowl into a few mini burritos! I know not all Chipotles serve margaritas but this one does and they serve it STRONG. Their ingredients are always fresh and even when there are long lines it moves fast. 

Hands down, best guacamole and chips!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Eh....it's chiptole. What do you expect?

I usually always get the chicken burrito bowl. I guess it really depends on the server because today I hardly got any meat in my burrito bowl. What a shame. I had to ask the lady twice for extra of everything because she barely put anything in. 

Pretty fresh veggies and the salsa is good. 

The guac and chips is pretty good here. 

Price for a burrito bowl is around $6.50. It's not really cheap and they never have coupons haha :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">If you've been to one Chipotle, you've been to them all. This place has a nice little patio dining area, though. Parking is in a big strip mall lot, which can be hard to find parking in during busy times. Good tasting food, if not a bit pricy.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">You can either hate Chipotle for being non authentic Mexican food or love it just because its something a little different. 

First off if you get the burrito here you are an idiot but if you happen to get a burrito you have to have them mix it for you otherwise you will have to go through all the phases. Rice beans meat lettuce and its not as appetizing. 

On the other hand if you got a burrito bowl then your a genius. The key to the burrito bowl is that you ask for tortilla on the side. The tortilla is completely free and you get the bowl. Then you ask for a cup of water and fill that baby up with coke and your set. (I only got caught once) 

that is the devilish way to get Chipotle. 

if you feel like a baller than you guacamole that burrito bowl up and your set. 

Now this is personally one of my favorite Chipotle because this is where I use to hang out with all my friends and talk about all things. 

It was our hangout and will always be my second home.

Skinny fat kids unite!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Here is the deal...I figured it out tonight.  I told Jeff V. that Chipotle has really good, consistent and addicting food and that is why I like going but as far as customer service goes this place stinks. Actually most Chipotle establishments have someone shitty working behind the counter or cash register. I have almost NEVER had good customer service at any Chipotle I have been to.  With one exception (Chipotle in Santa Ana on Bristol) there is one awesome brown chola that always used to hook me up.  I miss her...that was my @ school Chipotle. 

Unfortunately, that one cool lady can't make up for all the times that I have been thrown attitude or my salsa magically never gets put into my to go bag or perhaps when the restaurant refuses to make black beans....granted they were closing in 10 mins but honestly, they are just going to force me and the other 5 couples in line behind us to pay for something we don't want or possibly some of us cannot eat. FYI the re fried beans have BACON DRIPPINGS in them, a half a cup for a pound of beans. FAT and NOT cool.   Not very helpful at all. I hate it when places close up their stuff and don't offer things just because they are near closing time... technically they are not closed and that is not good customer service at all. 

This location is the worst by far and the parking lot is HORRIBLE. Everyone parks and drives like A-Holes.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Love this place for it's simplicity. But since it's a franchise, it's hard to compare it to wahoo's. this place is closer to me so it's second best. Since their burritos are ginormous, order a bowl and the flour tortilla separately, less messier<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like Chipotle. I really do...just not this one.  For starters the parking is such a pain in the ass in this lot often times it is jam packed to the point where it's annoying and you have to drive around in circles just to get a lousy spot.  

Secondly, I order online a lot and they have not perfected this system yet, every time I place an online order for this Chipotle there is always something wrong with the order.  It's been so BAD that they have compensated by giving my entire office free lunch and there were still items wrong even on the compensation order.  

The only time I will come here now is when I am desperate and forget my lunch on the counter at home.  If the lot is packed chances are I will just drive by and go without eating at all.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What people are not mentioning in their reviews is that the meats at this place are "natural" to almost "organic." Hence the slightly higher price. Go to their website to get full clarification but they thrive off of being a great healthy place.

Please go to any other Chipotle than the Fullerton one. The Fullerton one you will seriously pull your hair out from parking to standing in line for about 20 minutes. Everyone is right. It's fricken a nightmare, and that is "non peak" hours too!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Everyone I know talks about "chipotle this"..."chipotle that"... and I never tried it ... even though it is like 5 minutes away from my school. So anyway my friend came home from up north and we were going out for lunch, and she wanted chipotle, so next thing I know im in front of the counter getting asked what I wanted on my chicken burritto. I was kind of over whelmed the first time having to choose what you wanted in it, its like a subway for burrittos! Anyway I chose this and that and ended up loving it! Seriously it is good food, at a good price. The chips were great, I love the lime flavor that they have. 
Anyway This place really is great, and is better than the one in yorba linda.
Oh and the servings are huge if your really really hungry you can finish off the burritto, or else it will do you two meals.
Subway for burrittos.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This place gets a ton of traffic during the busy time so plan on visiting during the slow hours. I've never really had anything bad to say about any chipotle, except that sometimes, just SOMETIMES I go to this location they become "stingy" on the meat side. So much I ask for a bit more so my burrito bowl can at least look a bit full.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I used to come to Chipotle a lot. I gave it three stars because the food is okay, I mean its nothing special because it is a chain. I'm a vegetarian so I usually only get the veggie burrito. Its kind of pricey for just veggies. I can go to a small Mexican restaurant that serves way better food and its cheap and authentic.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chicken burrito with corn and add avocado is definitely the way to go. Good food for good price. Don't fool yourself into thinking its "healthy", but it is delicious though<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle is Chipotle and this one is decent. The line is really long during and after dinnertime, though. I really like the cold corn salsa that comes with the chips!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Eh not much to say.  The subway of burritos.  Good but not the best mexican you can get.  A good bang for your buck but if craving mexican food you should probably go somewhere else.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love chipotle but it seems every time I come here I get less an less chicken in my burrito and that is just disappointing. You guys advertise a big burrito.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">For white wash its pretty good, can't complain as all white wash it lacks "kick " in the salsa never spicey get that and I'm sold<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Look, I've always loved Chipotle's delicious burritos and the quality of ingredients is generally high. But my fiance and I got food poisoning there after we both ordered veggie burritos on Thursday, and took nearly 4 1/2 days to get over it, so we won't be going back to this location ever again (and will stay away from the chain for a pretty hefty waiting period).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Took me a while, but I got on the Chipotle Burrito Band Wagon, but I got there!!!

The first time I went there, I had no clue what I had to do or order.... so I picked the chicken burrito, little did I know that I would have to choose the beans, rice or no rice, salsa, sour cream or no cream, any cheese, any guac?!?!? That was a lot of choices for someone who hardly makes decisions. The girl there was so sweet when she redid my whole burrito when I switched salsa choices from mild to medium (bless her cause I had no idea what I was doing).

Ever since then, I have order the chicken burrito, with rice, black beans, the mild salsa with the corn in it, sour cream, cheese (cause who doesn't love cheese) and guac on the side. That's my jammed pack chicken burrito.

Next I will try the burrito bowls, the tacos, the salads... whatever they can throw at me! 

I have also gotten my parents hooked on the craze too. When I tell them I'm going to eat there, they immediately place their orders. So now I have to memorize 3 burrito orders now. 

I'm just sad that there isn't a chipotle near the office.... which I guess is a good thing seeing how my gym trainer would kill me if I ate that every day.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">CHIPOTLE is BOMB, everything is made fresh and yummy. The salsa and torilla chips is super good too. My favorite is the burrito (which is as big&fat as my head lol kidddinn) haha, eat that with the smoke tabasco sauce they have and you'll taste the bombest burrito ever! So try it!(:

* Students get free soda, so bring your id cards ;)

The location is in a very good area, & there's a yogurtland/baskin robbins/starbucks next store! So you can drop by there after eating chipotle for a little dessert! mmmmmm 

The bad thing is, it always super packed and there's never any seating . The lines are crazy long, but they work quick so you end up not having to wait that long. Just in case though, they allow you to call ahead of time and order whatever you want so you can just come in, pick up & pay. Lastly, its pretty expensive, I can't afford to eat there everyday, even though I wish I could.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I know you're a food corporation Chipotle.  I know, I know, I know.  Yet, I feel a deeper connection with you.  Is it wrong that I often times think of you and look forward to seeing you?  Being with you?  I walk in through your doors and immediately I feel like I'm home.  I get excited as I wait in line, thinking about what you have to offer me and ohhh don't even get me started on how you delight my senses with your good lovin'!!! 

Oh, Chipotle... regardless of what I know with my reason--that you are a corporation looking to make a profit--in my heart I truly know that you're there for me in my times of hunger, in my times of need, and I thank you for this.

I miss you...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I used to not be a fan of Chiptotle until I tried the carnitas burrito.  Very tasty, and in my opinion the best texture of the available meats.  I also love the rice (usually forgoe beans and just ask for extra rice in my burrito).  The burrito ends up being so packed the server can barely wrap it!

This location gets CRAZY crowded during lunch so come early (before 11:30) or expect a long wait (and no available seats).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I miss this location!! I went to CSUF so I was here often for Chipotle and Yogurtland!
It gets busy throughout the day and parking can be a pain in the butt! But it's not impossible! =)
Burrito bowls are the way to go.
The staff is pretty friendly and I was always satisfied with the food.
Overall, my favorite Chipotle location!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I like this location better than the new Brea location. Yes it is crowded and yes the parking lot sucks. Everything else is great<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I am a vegetarian and love chipotle's salad bowls. I always work the system and ask for a free tortilla on the side and an extra salad dressing. the dressing is caloric but delicious and I love the fajitas. 
The only thing keeping me from giving this restaurant a 5 is the fact that it's in Fullerton and extremely busy every time i go there. there is always a line and don't even think about going there during lunch time if you do not have 20 extra minutes to wait in line. 
the chipoltle flavored hot sauce is also great!
they have cilantro if you ask, but most people don't know about it.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">All right Chipotle= Good eats for Dirt Cheap!
Every Chipotle is always damn packed.
A burrito the size of person's head is about $5, and if you have a student id freee drink!

Pour the smoked tabasco all over them babies, chips&Guac you're set.
OMG their Guacamole is pretty damn delicious.  And the corn salsa (I always ask for extra corn salsa)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">always good food no matter which one i go to.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's pretty awesome just like all their other locations. Burrito Bowls are where it's at :P this place is pretty full and busy most the time, I try get there before 1 for lunch if I want to beat the crowd. Parking is okay here.

The gauc is overpriced! don't bother. :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Good food, horrendous service. They overcharge me everytime and the employees have attitude. The portions are getting smaller and they have just lost a customer for life. I'll make the extra drive to brea. To the girl who posted that maybe the bad service was due to the fact that she's Asian. Nope, it's equal opportunity bad service for everyone(I'm Mexican ).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Food and service here is good.  Tip - order online before you go since the lines get very long.  Also, check the order before you leave.  They have messed up my orders on a few occasions.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">..Everybody knows chipotle is the bomb.
Because this one is close to school...there are often long lines and no seats.
But this one is nice because it is located right by CSUF, 3 other little squares that have fun things to do (99 cent store, smart and final PLUS!, goodwill, yogurtland, starbucks....and many more)
cheap fast yummy food :)


...they have really yummy tortilla chips.  I dont kow why..i guess they are just more crispy then crunchy and nicely flavored :)


yay students get free sodas :)<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">food is great

parking suck OMG! they need to bulldose the rest of the parking lot. what a nightmare! order online and save time and avoid the CSUF Line!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Hard to compare one Chipotle to another, but coming from someone who's been to his fair share on many road trips across the county, I have no complaints about our local one. Simple, fresh, quality ingredients.. no exaggeration this is one of my favorite foods out there. 

Here at Fullerton, be mindful of when school lets out if you want to avoid big crowds - it's sandwiched between Cal State and Fullerton College.

Little known tip? You can pick more then one meat. Try half chicken and half barbacoa. You can thank me later.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Chipotle's BOMB! I love their corn salsa :] Get vegetarian! You get guac for freeee.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">So like, I LOVE ME some Chipotle.  When I have a bad day, Chipotle makes me happy.  So it saddens me a lot that I cannot give this particular Chipotle 5 stars.  

I just can't.  

Firstly, there's the parking.  Call me old and crotchety, but this parking lot is a nightmare.  College kids running amuck everywhere, driving poorly and obnoxiously.  Once you find yourself inside, you'll probably be standing at the entrance of the door, because there's ALWAYS a line at this Chipotle. 

Once you get to the front to tell the nice guy your order, he seemingly listens to you, but throws your burrito bowl over to the next girl and the next girl and so on, while you're still at the first guy trying to order your husband's burrito.  So now I've completely lost track of my burrito bowl, and they're attempting to catapult my husband's burrito to the finish line as fast as they can.  Then they cover it up and wrap it, and then try to give my first item to someone else in front of me, because they've lost track of whose stuff is whose.  This ALWAYS ends badly for me.  They ALWAYS forget something, and when you're taking it home to eat, it's really depressing to realize they neglected to put your black beans or guacamole in your burrito bowl.  I'm too lazy to call and complain or take it back (the PARKING LOT!!!).  They HAVE done this to me while eating in the restaurant, and I did complain that time...but seriously.

I wish they'd just SLOW DOWN.  This isn't a race.  If I have to wait ONE MORE MINUTE for my burrito bowl to be correct, it's fine.  I don't think the world will end.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">When I place an online order for 25 burritos and go to your business for pick-up, help me out when you lose my order. It's a mistake and I'm not mad, but don't look at me and tell me I can check your screen; make it right. You didn't. You lose my business.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is one of the few places that can fill me up... and that takes a lot of food for me!

Overall, the food is good. The only thing that kind of sucks with this place is when a new person is working in the front and the new person takes twice as long as an experienced person. Would recommend to at least try out the place, if you haven't already.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">My co-worker and I went to this joint on a weekday.  As usual, the line was long.  My co-worker had to go to the restroom, while I waited in line for the both of us.  When she comes back, she yells from the end of the line, "Ags.  I can't eat here!  It was gross in the bathroom!"  Of course...I straight got outta that line, and we left to go next door to Pick Up Stix.  

It turns out that while my co-worker was in the bathroom, there were 2 stalls.  (Don't worry, it doesnt' get graphic.)  My co-worker was in one, and some other person was in the other stall.  The other person was on the phone while peeing, and of course, my co-worker thought that was way weird.  They both happened to get out at the same time.  My co-worker stops at the sink, while the other person continues on the phone, and proceeds out the door!!!  When she looked to see what kind of person would leave without washing their hands, she saw the back of the girl's t-shirt that says, "I made the salsa."  (Chipotle's signature shirt.)  DISGUSTING.  Needless to say, after my co-worker washed her hands, she grabbed me, and we left.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would like to believe I am an understanding and quite forgiving patron.  Because I know that sometimes restaurants have their off days.  But what makes up for those days is how they handle it.  And there were 2 incidents in which they handled it very poorly.  Although it is a chain, quality can vary amongst the places and the way the food is prepared and presented makes all the difference.  So... this place has 1 chance left to get it right or I'm going to report them to headquarters.  What happened?  I'll tell you~

Incident #1
I ordered a chicken burrito bowl.  I took a bite and was happily munching away.  About half way through, I looked down to scoop my next bite, when I spotted a little black thing.  Do my eyes deceive me?  Is that a gnat sleeping (aka dead) in my bed of lettuce? Hmmm.... *pick it out, place on my napkin, and continue eating*  Extra protein right?  
As I reach to take another bite, I look down at my fork and spot another little black thing, the dead gnat's cousin perhaps?  Haaay~ it's a family affair!  But afraid my stomach might end up as a gnat cemetary, I brought the bowl to the cashier/manager and showed him the little creatures.  He nonchalantly threw away the bowl and proceeded to make me a new one, before I even opened my mouth.  No "I'm sorry"  No "We'll give you a refund"  No NOTHING.  
So, like a good girl, I took my new bowl back and sat down to finish just a few more bites (I was hungry).  When lo and behold... another FRIGGIN GNAT!  *sigh*  At that point I was too disgusted with the gnats and the staff's behavior to even bother to complain.

Incident #2  (3 months later)
During lunch hours, this place can get pretty crowded with a line going almost out the door.  But this day, it was pretty slow (maybe about 3-4 people in line).  The first lady in line prepared the tortilla for my burrito, I tell her "just a little pinto beans please."  She hands it off to the guy next to her and he plops a heaping scoop of beans.  I am speechless.  I stare at him and say "didn't I just say I wanted a LITTLE?"  He has a dumb look on his face and says "ohh" and continues to stand there holding my burrito.  I felt like we were in a staring contest to see who blinks first.  So I'm waiting for him to take off the beans or start making a new one, but the sucker doesn't budge (damn!).  Not wanting to be rude and hold up the line, I give up.  Next come the vegetable and condiments.  The lady asks if I want sour cream. "A li~" *plopping a ladelfull of cream* "~ttle."  At least she has the "oops, my bad" face and tries to wipe some off, but it's too late.  She hands it to the next lady and she starts to roll it up, which at this point I can't take anymore and yell "STOP!"  geez, and I wanted some lettuce (yeah I know).  So the woman sprinkles a few strands of lettuce and pauses to double check if there is anything else I want, like it was my fault they are moving too fast.  Dejected, I say no and proceeds to roll the burrito which now looks positively violated.  Finally, it is my turn to pay.  The lady is rushing me to hurry up and pay, when the good girl inside of me wants to cuss everyone out, but instead I shout at them "SLOW DOWN WILL YAH?!! GEEZ!!!!! THERE'S HARDLY ANYONE IN LINE!!!"  There is a brief moment of silence... did it get through to them?  No... not one bit.  After I get my change, everyone goes back to feverishly generating disfunctional burritos.

I really want to like you Chipotle, I honestly do.  But you make it so difficult.  I'll say it again... you have ONE last chance.

Update:  I went back a couple days ago to get a chicken bowl.  The service was ok this time, they were not being pushy.  HOWEVER, they ran out of chicken.  Wait, there's more.  So a couple of us were standing there waiting for the chicken to be ready.  I was thinking to myself, great~ I'm gonna get fresh chicken!  But when I got home and proceeded to eat, I noticed some of the chicken pieces looked undercooked.  Luckily I did see the griller stick in a themometer in the chicken, so I'm sure it was "somewhat safe" to eat.  But it was only once, and I don't think he checked all of them.  That was my last chance for this Chipotle, I shall eat here no more.  (To show you guys I'm not making this stuff up I took photos this time, see pictures).<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Consistantly good, not great. But their meat options are on the healthier side.  I was told they are ORGANIC, but I haven't seen that in writing.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">What o' what was I doing up in Fullerton for lunch on a Thursday you might ask? The easy answer is that I was up here to sign some papers. At least I was supposed to be. I drove up from Irvine on my lunch to take a lunch meeting with a legal document preparer. I rolled up on time, one o'clock, just to find a locked office. I called the guy, whose name is also Dave, who answered the phone, "Legal document preperation."

"umm Dave, are you close by?"
"ohhh, no, I had some trouble getting out of San Diego."
"i see"
"yeaaaah. I'm all the way down by Mission Viejo"
"That's not good."
"No.. It's not."
"We had a one o'clock today, guy" (I only call people "guy" when I'm pissed)
"Yeah, I know, but I got stuck down here in San Diego. Can you come back later?"
"DUDE, I just drove up here from work, you knew that's what I was doing!"
"can I just mail them to you, and you can sign and mail them back?"
"yeah, that's fine. whatever."

I hung up. I will be yelping about him later, but only after he finishes with my paperwork. 

I had the steak burrito with pinto beans, no salsa, extra hot sauce, light cheese. Mind you I had it only 10 minutes after this conversation and it made everything alright. god bless Chipotle's GIANT burritos. I only ate half and am saving the other half for dinner. It was delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Chipotle never disappoints.  I love it here and their burritos have to be one of the best out there.  Prices are very good, especially for the number of college students in the area, including myself.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">it was not a surprise that the place was busy on Saturday night, but I usually like a busy spot because that means the food is NOT sitting around waiting to be picked.  

the concern was finding a table, especially with the college crowd, which seemed like NO problem. everyone was in and out of there as soon as they were done, with a few couples...maybe on their first date or something like that.

the service was quick and very, very good. in fact, I'm giving it 5 stars because one employee was on his break, but when he noticed that the iced tea dispenser was out...he went to the back to inform the others that we needed more iced tea. didn't get his name or I would have given him a shout out in the review.

maybe my favorite Chipotle spot in the OC...<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I usually try to stay away from reviewing chain restaurants because the quality of food and service is fairly consistent wherever you go. However, I felt compelled to write up this Chipotle because of their abnormally outstanding staff and great customer service.

I dropped a glass bottle of jalapeno tabasco sauce here and it shattered all over the floor, splattering all over some guy sitting at a table near me.  I almost died. I was so embarrassed. Everyone was staring at me. I started stuttering out an apology and grabbing napkins to help clean off the man when some of the staff came rushing out with a broom. They asked me if I was ok, they asked the splattered man if he was OK, and then proceeded to quickly clean up the mess I'd made. Everything was cleaned up in less than a minute and they even asked me if I wanted more tabasco sauce (I had to say no while my face turned red in shame) I then rushed over to the splattered man to see if I could be of any assistance but he just smiled and told me he wasn't hurt, it was only a little bit of hot sauce and his favorite kind to boot, so not to worry about it and make sure I wasn't hurt myself.

Man.. are these people nice or are they NICE??!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Chipotle sucks always over crowded with douche bags and there's no parking ever! Why 2 stars then? It's Chipotle, come on!!! Love the guacamole, dig on the salsas, the rice is awesome, I'm just saying if you have to go to this one, order on line!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food here is just fantastic and their portions are usually pretty good (though not always by default, I almost always have to ask for more). Being that this location is right in between two major colleges, it gets quite busy at times and expecting to wait around 20 minutes if going for dinner is a good idea.

Some of the workers there experience a pretty big language barrier and sometimes it's difficult to explain that you'd like a vegetarian burrito and that it includes no meat. Also, they tend to skimp on the rice which probably isn't bad if you're getting meat but on a vegetarian burrito that's much of what it includes. Most of the workers also don't realize that the black beans are the only vegetarian beans as their pinto beans are cooked in bacon.

The service is usually pretty quick though sometimes I think they focus more on getting food done quickly than being friendly and not seeming rushed. In fact, there's times where your burrito will get well ahead of you while in line and you have to shout what you'd like on it across a number of people because the cash register can't keep up with the people making the food.

Unfortunately this location (and possibly others) no longer offer free soda to college students.

This location seems a bit dirty at times. The tables are rarely cleaned off by the workers and pieces of food frequently cover the floor. The soda machine also never seems to have any ice.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Great Location. Great fresh food at a reasonable price. This is one of the few places I will order pork, very little fat. I especially enjoy making the salad choice. They buy all their produce and meats from local farms, the meats are antibiotic free. It's truly a great business model. Fast, fresh, tasty, affordable and it's a great for the local economy. I love this place!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">It's hard for me to resist since I live less than a block away from here, but I think the prices keep me away. Definitely not somewhere I can afford to eat everyday. I've had no problem with the staff or ordering.

I used to love the burritos, but lately it just seems...excessive. Too much food, too much sodium apparently, and, most importantly, too much money. If anyone knows how to make their rice, please let me know. Thanks!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I love their burritos. Chipotle is healthy and the quality of their food is better than Alberto's.   Too bad parking isn't that great at this location.  Try your food with Tabasco Chipotle sauce.  It's delicious.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">Consistently good limited menu Mexican. Barbacoa is the best meat.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This Chipotle is the worst Chipotle I been too. Everytime i go they say they ran out of something & I have to wait 10min extra. Last time I went they made us wait 15minutes just for meat. I kept going thinking that it was just one person that messed up.. The next time I went they didn't put the right amount of meat on my bowl so I asked for more and they had a horrible attitude about it. Then I went today & they made me 3bowls and once again didn't add the right amount of meat. So I asked for more and they had a big attitude about it, Then I asked them for corn and they said I had to wait 10min So I asked them why they didn't have extra and they ignored me and kept taking other customers orders. So I asked to speak to a manager Luis Ayala  and I explained to him and he said It sounded I was making excuses to get free food. So I got mad and told him to just get my bowls ready and they told me they threw them in the trash and to get in line again and tell them what i ordered. I asked why they did that and they said because all there food is fresh. So the manager Luis said just give them free guacamole so they can leave.. So when they were ringing us up the cashier was mad at us and I said you know what keep you're food I will not be coming back here. Made me mad I had my5month old waiting in the long line for nothing! Coming to find out when I get home Luis Ayala was not the manager he was an Apprentice.. & I know a review will not make it better but atleast You guys know what the customer service is like.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I went to this place once and realized that everything tastes good with scoops and scoops of sour cream. You can take left overs from a septic tank and toss it in a burrito shell, add SOUR cream and it will taste like magic. Everything here has loads of sour cream, and loads of calories. But what the hell! It tastes great! The prices could be a little cheaper, but apparently they think they are fancier then your mom and pop Mexican joints. You will be shelling out about $7-8 for a burrito lunch at this place. Definitely not a CSUF undergrad friendly price. More like a grad student holding two jobs type of price.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">mmm tasty burritos. The vegetarian black beans and the guacamole are amazing. The rice, you either hate it or love it. My boyfriend didn't like the rice, but he does really like white rice. I don't like white rice so much either but I loved the rice. They add some spices to it and it goes excellent with the black beans. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty. They even advertise hormone free meat, and organic ingredients. The guacamole is made fresh 3 times a day (that's why its so good). This place gets packed around noon on weekdays because of the surrounding schools. I'd recommend going a little earlier or a little later if you can. I've seen the line wrapped all the way around the place and up to the doors on more than one occasion!<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">The food- Fantastic as always!!  Its just so overcrowded (including the parking lot) during peak hours.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">usually chipotle's rate 4 or 5 stars, but this place gets a lower one cuz 1. the service was horrible. 2. the parking sucks, but thats not really their fault. 3. and this is most important, theyre so stingy with their portions. i like getting a barbacoa bowl that weighs like 3 lbs when everythings said and done. the the place by my work hooks you up. this place? i shoulda paid only half price cuz i got half a portion in my opinion. will only come back if im super craving chipotle while im at home cuz its down the street from my apt. but im moving soon so i wont have to deal with these jerk offs for much longer. i have the same complaints about the one down the street on imperial and associated.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">This is literally my favorite place to eat after school ! It's so filling and all of their meat is cooked perfectly.  I love their carnitas.  Their burrito is the size of a brick; it's huge for under 10 dollars.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I would eat a chicken burrito from here if the damn calorie content wasnt so high. Seriously, like 1000 calories or something. I stick to the burrito, with chicken or steak. Never lets me down. The people are nice. Not a bad price either.<p>
</p></p><p itemprop="description">I have to admit, when I was a student at CSUF, I would come here almost everyday for lunch. The food is great and the rice is spectacular. The salsa is homemade and the chips are the bomb. The lines are usually lone, since this is the only Chipotle around for miles and there's a high school and college nearby. I would order the chicken bowl with cheese- yummy.<p>
