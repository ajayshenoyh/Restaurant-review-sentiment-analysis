                    I was here for a business trip for three days from 24th - 26th March, 2015. The overall experience was great and the pricing is pretty decent compared to the quality of service. Overall it was a great deal.

The rooms are equipped with central AC's, electronic safe and TV's. The beds and furniture in the rooms were lavish and very comfortable. The WiFi connection was very fast and reliable.

The staff was very courteous and helpful. I was really amazed by the quality and punctuality of the housekeeping service. There are couple of restaurants serving a wide variety of cuisine and the fide was really amazing, though it was a bit spicy than what we would normally expect. The prices in the restaurant are very reasonable too.

The hotel is located in a very prime location with close access to Malls and other shopping areas. Overall it is situated in a calm and peaceful location and I would definitely recommend this hotel for business trips.

The rooms are equipped with central AC's, electronic safe and TV's. The beds and furniture in the rooms were lavish and very comfortable. The WiFi connection was very fast and reliable.

The staff was very courteous and helpful. I was really amazed by the quality and punctuality of the housekeeping service. There are couple of restaurants serving a wide variety of cuisine and the fide was really amazing, though it was a bit spicy than what we would normally expect. The prices in the restaurant are very reasonable too.

The hotel is located in a very prime location with close access to Malls and other shopping areas. Overall it is situated in a calm and peaceful location and I would definitely recommend this hotel for business trips.

                    I visited South India for vacations and stayed here for a week. They provided best quality food I had in south India. Their maharaja thali was great even though they were very small. The taste and service was great. There was problem with wifi I guess but other services were good and they have good parking facility. I would like to recommend others to stay here and also visit Barbecue Nation.
