The facilities offered are not commensurate with the tariff. The Bath room is small but comparatively clean. When we entered the room the AC was not working. The room boy had to call the maintenance to restore the power. Food is OK, though slightly over priced. Restaurant staff were courteous and pleasing. But for the higher room tariff, the over all impression is OK.</blockquote>
