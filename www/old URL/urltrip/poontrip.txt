 It was a one night stay while I was on a business trip and I was provided with everything I need. 
 Clean cozy room. 
 delicious late night supper. 
 good breakfast. 
 no problems with wifi connection. 
 The staff was helpful and polite. 
 And the hotel itself is situated near the central railway station.

It`s a very comfortable hotel. 
 It`s situated in a very developed area. 
 There's developed infrastructure around it. 
 Rooms are convenient and cute. 
 Excellent service and very friendly and courteous staff. 
Great place to stay. 




the hotel has a 24 hour check in. 
check out policy which turned out to be very convenient for me as i was suppose to check in earlier in the evening . 
 due to a delayed flight had to check in late in the night. 
The hotel was more than happy to accomodate me without the hassel of being charged for 2.

Great place to stay. 
The hotel provided everything I needed.

parking. 
good breakfasts. 
 Besides. 
 the location is good I could get to the city center very fast. 
 The place is easy to find. 
 And the rooms are cosy and clean. 




The hotel was booked for one person for one day. 
 I called ahead before booking and confirmed that the hotel had 24. 
7 check in.

But. 
 when I reached the reception I was told that the rooms are not ready and I had to wait for an hour.

It use to be a class hotel few years ago. 
 However over the period it remains same . 
 everything is getting old. 
 No upgradation happened. 
 Even though staff is very friendly and courteous hotel doesn't fit to the category of value for money. 
 Worst part is WiFi is available only in Lobby. 




i arrived last week in the evening. 
 i had confirmed the booking my paying the advance. 
 the hotel was full. 
 I drove so there is no signs as to show the hotel. 
 and they do have pvt parking in the hotel. 
 check in was fast. 
 rooms were ok. 
 for the amount i was paying for a delux i expected better.

Stayed in this hotel for a couple of nights and it was pleasant. 
 The room was rather spacious. 
 a big bed with a convenient mattress and the choice of pillows. 
 Linen of fine quality. 
 the bathing room had all necessary for comfortable stay. 
 daily cleaning. 
 The staff was attentive. 




I've been staying in this hotel for 3 days. 
 It is located near the city center with a lot of malls and you can easily reach the railway station. 
 I had a single room. 
 It was clean with a very comfortable bed. 
 The dinner in the restaurant was good. 
 The nice staff made my stay very pleasant. 




My family had been planning the trip for a long time and the quality of hotel service was very important for us. 
 Finally. 
 we chose Poonja International hotel. 
 It was a really proper choice. 
 as its stuff is highly-qualified. 
 Every time when I needed something. 
 somebody came to help me and solve my problems with smile and patience.

 Rooms are good. 
 Courteous service both front and room. 
 Good lobby. 
 Wifi only in lobby. 
 Food was good. 
 Janata delux hotel famous for neer dosa is 2furlongs away and so is ideal icecream center known for icecream. 
 City center mall is very close. 
 You can enjoy your stay. 




Stayed in Poonja International 2 weeks ago and have completely nothing to complain about. 
 The stuff was so nice and polite. 
 every time I needed something they were always very patient and kind with me. 
 as I several times asked for extra shower gel and shampoo. 
 The location is great. 
 very convenient. 
 Rooms are nice and even better then i.

Before my vacation I read a lot of reviews and looked though a lot of photos of hotels and finally chose this one. 
 And it was the right choice. 
 The main advantages of this hotel are:

 staff is very polite). 

2) Rooms (mine was cozy. 
 neat and had a.

One of the best places I have been. 
 My husband and I loved this hotel because it was very cozy and lovely. 
 Moreover it is situated near the bus stop and it is very convenient. 
 If my husband and I visit this city again we will stay here again for sure. 




I’ve stayed in this hotel for a while and I’m completely satisfied. 
 The room was nice. 
 neat and wide. 
 with the beautiful view from the window. 
 Everything is clean and nice. 
 and the staff was very pleasant. 
 As they say: It’s all about the people who make the hotel a worth place. 
 Well. 
 they are definitely the best and that’s.

It was great in there. 
 Amazing lobby with friendly staff. 
 Room is very comfy with TV and good view. 
 Yuvraj is a nice place with delicious food and fast service. 
 Everything is clean and tidy. 
 Definitely recommend it. 




I really admired the staff in the hotel - it's been a while since I've seen so sincere and kind staff. 
 They deserve all the credit - my compliments to the cheff too - we didn't even have to go out - the food was so nice there. 




The location of the hotel is good and the staff members are very courteous however. 
 this hotel has its own perennial issues of oldness though the management made their best efforts to improve it. 
 I had opted an Executive AC room and the room was quite spacious . 
 the bathroom was very small and you will not find a hook.

Hotel Poonja International one of Mangalore's oldest hotel is a nice place to stay. 
 Rooms are spacious and clean. 
 need to upgrade their AC's. 
 Service is good . 
 their breakfast spread and food quality needs a lot of improvement. 
 If it improves on this 2 aspects then it is worth the money spent. 
 Overall a good experience and also it.

We were given a room in second floor. 
 The view was nice. 
Neat interior. 
 with room-calls attended promptly. 
 Food was good. 

More hooks and hangers could be provided. 
 Bills were promptly handled. 
Would love to return again and would also refer this hotel to other people. 




We stayed here on 15th August 2016. 
 All very clean and well lit rooms. 
 Hotel Staff . 
 management team is very courteous. 
 Hotel at good location with reasonable room tariff. 
 WiFi is available only in the lobby and not in the rooms. 
 sure would like to stay here if visiting this city again. 




I have spend great time in this marvellous hotel. 
 Remember those times with pleasure. 
 Clean. 
 well-lit rooms with lovely decorations. 
 Delicious. 
 varied food. 
 everything was fresh and tasty. 
 Very friendly personnel. 
 ready to help anytime. 
 Will visit it again with no hesitation. 




I was here last month and I'm pleased with this hotel. 
 Location of the hotel is comfortable. 
 Rooms are fully-furnished. 
 with not up-to-date style. 
 . 
 it's quite OK. 
 I was very satisfied after dinner cause it was incredible. 
 Staff is warm-hearted and obliging. 
 So if I visit this city once more. 
 I will choose this hotel. 




So i think its time to share my opinion too :). 
 We visited Poonja hotel last year with my parents. 
 We had only good impressions of it. 
 Nice design. 
 very friendly personnel. 
 perfect breakfasts. 
. 
. 
 Also i can notice location of hotel: it is very comfortable for sightseeing and shopping. 
 I think we will come back this fall. 




It is a great hotel. 
Breakfasts are really good here. 
I was here with my husband last year and we really liked it. 
not far from the center so all the destinations can be approached very easily. 
Honestly. 
I liked this place so much that I want to go there again this year and probably next year. 
That's the best place in town for sure. 
This I.

 Very comfortable rooms with flowers greetings you look nice and highly qualified personal at reception make a hotel check-In very fast. 




This hotel is far from luxury if you know what I mean. 
 . 
 is quite nice in its category. 
 I appreciate good location. 
 commercial center is right in front of hotel. 
 Nice service and staff. 
 It was a pleasant stay. 
 I can recommend this hotel to my friends. 




Nice hotel. 
 I realy enjoyed it. 
 Nothing special . 
 the atmosphere is very homely. 
 A very fasсinating view from windows. 
 The room service is good too. 
 I will recomend this hotel to my friends. 
 Enjoy.

This hotel is located in the central area of Mangalore city. 
 This is a one of the old hotels in mangalore. 
 Rooms are neat and clean and spacious. 
 needs renovation. 
 Service is OK and serves complimentary breakfast for a. 
c room inmates and the quality of food is Ok



As for me the most important things for hotels are convenient location and good room service. 
 They are both on the highest level in this hotel. 
 If u want to go shopping the mall city centre is right across the street which is perfect for last min shopping if you havent gotten a chance to do it earlier. 
 And rooms.

This is by far a wonderful place to stay. 
 Especially friendly staff. 
 large suites. 
 perfect choice for families. 
 The rooms at the higher floor give a good birds eye view of the city as the hotel is the tallest one in the entire city hence very peaceful. 
 I hope to return very soon. 




I stayed in poonja international for a week with my wife and little son. 
 We had a quite big living room. 
 Property was not new . 
 nice and clean. 
 Food was very tasty and not too costly. 
 Also hotel service is pleasing. 
 We enjoyed it so much. 




Booked a suite room (room 615) for my family and kids. 
It had a nice living room with dining area . 
 free complimentary water. 
 coffee. 
tea maker with sufficient supplies. 
 Nice bedroom with king size bed and a huge bathroom with a nice bathtub which my kids enjoyed. 
The view from the room was breathtaking . 
 could see the sea from the room.

We used a banquet hall Samrat for a pre wedding sangeet ceremony with state of the art facilities provided. 
 such as a large projector screen. 
 music and abundent space for a makeshift dance floor. 
 We also liked the delicious appetizers provided such as chicken malai tikka. 
 paneer ghee roast hariyali kebabs and sea food. 
 I recommend the hall for receptions.

I stayed at this hotel with my mum. 
 Our room was beautiful and comfortable. 
 and most importantly always clean. 
 Location is also quite convenient and we have always had the opportunity to safely walk or take a bus to the tourist attractions. 




I've been there with my husband for our honeymoon. 
 Service in this hotel is on the highest level. 
 Also staff was really helpful and always ready to answer all our questions. 
 I find it very essential. 
 Moreover price here is quite reasonable. 
 Will recommend it to all my nearest and dearest. 




I visited this hotel recently and decided to leave a review because I really liked this place. 
 Delicious food. 
 nice atmosphere and friendly staff make your stay here pleasant. 
 For a very acceptable price I got a decent level of comfort. 
 I was satisfied with this hotel. 
 Thanks you. 




Had a conference for about 50 people arranged at the hotel's sabha conference hall while the delegates stayed at the hotel as well buffet was arranged at the hall as well. 

We were very pleased with the provided conditions. 
 We had everything for a comfortable stay and especially likes the buffet and the modern conference hall



As for me this hotel meets all high quality standards. 
 It's wonderful on everything from the smell in the hallway to sets of shampoos in the bathroom and big comfortable beds. 
 Moreover. 
there is professional. 
 experienced and polite staff. 
 All issues were resolved within 5 minutes. 
 I really like warm friendly atmosphere there. 
 so it would be nice to come back.

I visited this place with my brother and sister. 
 And you know. 
 I want to say that this hotel impressed us. 
 Very comfortable. 
 beautiful decoration. 
 clean rooms. 
 everything looks so great. 
. 
. 
 It is perfect place to come and relax after walking around the city. 
 I'm sure we once again get back. 




This place was quite nice. 
 We stayed for two nights and haven't been disappointed in our choice. 

The room was good . 
 too dark for me. 
 The complimentary breakfasts were okay. 

The best thing about this place is its location. 

Communication with staff was fine. 

Overall well worth the money paid. 




Located at a prime location in the city. 
 They have several rooms. 
 Rooms were average clean. 
 But bathroom was not. 
 The grout lines i. 
e. 
 the small gap between floor tiles in the bathroom was black with several years of dirt. 
 The AC in the rooms did not work properly. 
 The mattress. 
 pillows and comforters were good though and looked clean.

 My room was great. 
 very comfortable and clean and with a big TV set. 
 Next time I will stay there again.

I liked our stay in the Poonja hotel. 
 The place itself is nice as well as the people that work there. 
 The location is great. 
 The room was clean. 

Want to note that they have a bar that has been stocked with some finest alcohol for acceptable prices. 




The quickest check in I've ever seen before. 
 smooth check out. 
 Hospitable service - I felt almost at home:) Everything is done for clients' satisfaction. 
 The room was nicely decorated. 

Overall will recommend this place to my friends. 

Amazing

The rooms are really spacious. 
 The hotel is located in the center which makes it easier to travel round. 
 Nicely served measurements. 
 The staff were very friendly and helpful. 
 Staying here was really pleasant and relaxing. 




Hotel restaurant yuvraj is great. 
 We visited it with my friends. 
 Good and polite staff. 
 clean rooms and tasty food. 
 Also we was fond of chicken ghee roast it is real delicious. 
 My friends also liked it very much. 
 I think next year I will visit this place again. 
 And I advice everyone to come here. 




I wanted to experience premium service. 
 . 
 I was low on money. 
 That was the best offer I found on TripAdvisor. 
 We booked 3 rooms. 
 They are huge. 
 clean and featured with decent furniture. 
 Staff speaks at least 3 languages and they are ready to help anytime. 




I've been to many hotels during my trip to India and the main problem all of them as everybody knows is cleanliness. 
 Well the Poonja hotel met all my expectations. 
 Room and bathroom were clean enough. 

The room was spacious and had enough of furniture and a big bed with a new mattress. 

Location is good. 
 in the centre of.

Stayed one night & checked out as we could not stand the stinking smell. 
 there is no housekeeping at all in this hotel I think. 
 worst is the bathroom. 
 Please do not book online. 
 make sure to visit first. 
 then book it if you feel ok. 
 The gentleman at the reception is not polite. 
 unprofessional. 
 act over smart & not.

Difficult to decide where I should start. 
 The only - and I mean ONLY - good thing about this otherwise avoidable dump is the size of the rooms. 
 Our Executive AC room was quite spacious. 
 old-fashioned yes. 
 . 
 quite comfortable. 
 A larger bed would have suited it better though. 

Apart from this. 
 everything else goes wrong.

First I'll tell you. 
 this property is of the old fashioned variety. 
This includes a atrium in the building with high floors and wooden paneling everywhere. 
 But. 
 it is kept clean and neat and they've preserved the old charm in a good way. 

Very courteous front desk. 
 Easy check-in. 

The rooms match the old styled decor. 
 Kept very clean though.

The hotel has still in the old style. 
 They keeping it as it is like 25 years ago. 
 That's OK. 

But as I entered in the room there is mild bad odor as you entered the room. 
 after a while got used to it. 

Complimentary breakfast they provide is very very basic. 

The good thing is staff are very kind.

Dear All. 

I have recently stayed in this hotel for a very short stay of 1 day. 

As this hotel building is very old. 
 & rooms are other decor & infrastructure is also not of modern class which we all generally expect. 

But as I advise. 
 for a short stay of day or two. 
 this is good place as its.

We shifted from a hotel nearby as it was expensive. 
 The hotel is quite old and outdated. 
 Even if the prices are decent. 
 the hotel should update their rooms. 
 The reception were quick to check us in. 
 The car parking is good with a lot of space. 
 Was disappointed when the were painting the roof and did not have the.

I went with family and stayed for 3 days. 
 The staff was very welcoming. 
 rooms are decent. 
 not the best . 
 according to the price you pay. 
 the provide local authentic food of mangalore. 
 They can connect you with a local guide as well. 
 Centrally located. 
 Central market is near buy. 




The hotel is conveniently located close to the City center including the City Central Mall. 
 Number of eateries are nearby. 
 The rooms are fairly big and comfortable. 
 There is one restaurant by name Yuvraj which is quite expensive. 
 The fare from Airport to the hotel is Rs. 
 500. 
- for a prepaid taxi and takes about 45 minutes. 
 Overall we had.

Stayed at Poonja 3 years back. 
 it was decent and returned for a similar experience last week. 
 This hotel needs a good make over. 
 Rooms not clean. 
 taps not working. 
 water over flowing from bathrooms. 
 Better to avoid. 
 you will get better hotel for same rates. 




Poonja is an old world hotel from yesteryears. 
 28 years old and standing tall in the heart of mangalore town. 
 I had reserved a stay here for a family trip with a lot of expectations after looking at the reviews and age of the property. 
 We were 8 of us travelling with an infant. 
 Booked 4 non AC rooms through.

We stayed this hotel for our group booking of 59 person on 18th to 20th December 2015. 
 It was an amazing experience with friendly and very courtesy managements which made us to feel worth being to the hotel. 
 although the hotel seems to be bit old . 
 the hospitality at its best has made us to thank this hotel through.

it had a flat screen tv with a spacious living room and the room was clean and tidy. 
in addition to this the food was delicious.

I stayed at Poonja Hotel during Christmas holiday and it was horrible experience. 
 I went there with my family and had booked 2 AC rooms which was confirmed booking . 
 after reaching hotel they told that they can give only 1 room and refused to refund any money as well.

This hotel was a horrible experience. 
 Don't fall prey to their hospitality. 
 Pathetic service and washrooms. 
 If you are tired and are expecting good washroom for shower GOD SAVE YOU. 
 Delete this hotel from your list if ur visiting mangalore. 
 PATHETIC EXPERIENCE. 




I had booked this room after going through a lot of reviews and many other hotels. 
 The reviews were mixed. 
 Still I went ahead with the booking as I got a decent discount. 

We were impressed with the hotel's building and large parking space. 
 But then started the bad experiences. 
 The hotel poorly maintained. 
 Poor maintenance can be soon right.

The hotel is very badly maintained with no support from the staff. 
 I had to view 6 rooms before settling for a room that was the best amongst what I saw. 
 That room too was below mediocre. 
 Because of the bad room I spent most of my time outside in the city. 




I came to Manglore on a business trip and stayed here in the suite for 5 days and the staff was very courteous and I have noticed changes since my last visit. 
located in the heart of the city it's very convenient I enjoyed my stay here and will definitely come back again soon



Visited Poonja International after many years and I am very happy with my decision to come back here. 
 Could see many changes in the Hotel. 
 specially in the management and the way the staff treated me. 
 Had a wonderful stay and am surely coming back here when I am on my next trip to Mangalore. 
 I highly recommend this Hotel.

 Even convinced me to upgrade my room.

The room was tidy. 
 and our highlight was the delicious meal in the restaurant. 
 The duty manager was extremely helpful and friendly. 
 and in more than one occasion helped us with helpful information. 

A detail: on some reservation engines the hotel is rendered with a pool. 
 In reality. 
 it does not have one.

Hotel is located close to most places. 
 Hospitality is good . 

Elevator service is a huge problem. 
 at least one of the elevator was mostly down and other misbehaving. 
 Beds are good and room service is fine. 

Hot water in the mornings could be problem at times. 
 bath room needs a huge make over and everything needs to be maintained.

Nice corporate & budget Hotel withgood. 
 cleanly accommodationand food is quite nice ( the property is under renovation i assume) quite a good place and convenient location it is in heart of the city nd a mins walk to my favourite mall-city centre. 
 the staffs. 
specially the General Manager are very professional. 
 we enjoyed our stay. 
 Worth the money too :)



If you want to b in concrete city centre then u can stay in here. 
. 
. 
 However if you want to enjoy the real Mangalore. 
 try finding a place around uduppi. 
. 
. 
 The hotel is average . 
 the approach road is one way. 
. 
. 
. 
you will have hard time in reaching this place. 
. 
. 
 The morning breakfast buffet is below average n nothing will be.

It is located very closed to station. 
 That is only plus point. 
 Room was ordinary. 
 seemed hotel required renovation. 
 Service was poor. 
 There isn't much of a view from room. 
 It is just opposite a mall. 
 so good for shopping or eating out once your work is over. 




comparable the rate is very reasonable. 
 ( one should go for A. 
C Rooms) with clean and tidy. 
 big rooms. 
 the staffs are very professional and hospitable. 
 and moreover the location is very convenient and near to all the major places . 
. 
. 




The hotel is situated in the heart of the city where Railway station is just at 5 min distance. 
 Rooms are spacious. 
 Good mannered staff. 
 Friendly warm front desk. 
 Perfect for family or business stay. 
 Food though costly . 
 very tasty and nice. 
 Value for money. 




the hotel was good the room and staff response was good the hotel GM was very supportive the location of the hotel is very good there is no plug point near to the table. 
 please provide more plug point



Hotel needs refurbishing. 
 location is very convenient. 
 old property . 
 needs to maintain. 
 staff are ok. 

pool is out of order. 
 no in room entertainment TV is old. 
 does not work well. 
 very few channels Telephone ? horrible. 




This is a good hotel located in the center of the city with spacious and clean rooms . 
This hotel has enough space for car park. 
The staff is Courteous and efficient. 
 Little bit of refurbishing is required to enhance the aesthetic appeal



It is a 3 star hotel with not much better rooms and facilities. 
 . 
 the proceedures are simple. 
 a little excess rate on avarage facilities. 
 Room service and house keeping is good. 
 the restaurant Yuvraj inside this is awesome. 
 The rooms are little older in looks



1. 
 Font office response terrible. 

2. 
 Room service there cant be worse than this. 

3. 
 Staff seems thy are doing the charity. 

4. 
 In the night you will see 2-3 guys in white dress. 
. 
 seems like they are the god and others are there only to serve them. 

5. 
 We booked 5 rooms… . 
 had to struggle a lot to.

It's a good place to stay with family as the staff is very cooperative and friendly - though the rooms are overpriced compared to what the standard is - even the food prices are very high as the quality and taste is simply AVERAGE. 




I usually stay at deepa comforts in mangalore. 
 . 
 this time thought why i should i shell out 4k for a night and stayed at poonja. 

Positives: car parking. 
 bang in the centre of the city. 
 close to city center mall. 
 cheap at around 2. 
2k per night with 24 hrs chk out
Negatives: very old rooms. 
 cranky ac. 
 only one.

I stayed in this Hotel exactly 2 years back and was really happy staying then . 
 during this visit i find lot of issues that needs to be corrected by the hotel management. 

Hotel is well maintained. 
Food quality is reasonably good. 
Power back ups is available. 
Cab service is available in travel desk. 

Last visit to this hotel was on 24th Dec.

I stayed in Poonja International during last visit. 
 The cost is more as compared to the quality of the rooms and service offered. 

I was to wait around 1 hour as the room was not ready. 
 Further the room was having two separate single beds. 
. 
. 
 quite strange for family stay. 

The bathroom fittings are quite old. 
 and the towel also.

I was booked by a pharma company in this hotel for a medical conference that was being held in the city. 
 They couldn't get me an AC room due to the rush . 
 the non AC room i got was also good enough. 
 It was airy and comfortable. 
 Bathroom was clean and well maintained. 
 The breakfast spread was limited .

Had checked into Poonja International on the 2nd of April 2015 with family and friends to re-live old memories. 
 The experience was pathetic. 
 The front office staff appeared as if they are not aware of anything regarding the customers tariff plans. 
 The general service was absolutely poor . 
 To top it up. 
 there were bed bugs in the beds. 
 Would.

I had come to mangalore for just 10 hours and so all i needed was a place to freshen up. 
 Considering the location i thought poonja was ideal. 
 Checked in at 4AM and by 0715 i got a call asking me to shift from my alotted room 309 to room 310 as it was wrongly given by the receptionist. 
 Seriously.

A hotel you need to visit and stay I had been to Mangalore and stayed for 4 days with my wife and kids. 
 It's very nice Hotel of choice when you live in Mangalore. 
 The rooms are excellent and very good hospitality given by the staffs. 
 A home away from home. 

Raymond.

Booked here as was travelling from Madikeri to Thrissur Very well staffed at desk For some odd reason I had to pay more than the actual bill on my credit card Sure they did refund difference . 
 odd eh They seemed to suggest a previous guest had obsconded without paying That was the well manned fornt desks fault I feel.

Good hotel. 
 nice room (clean bed). 

Hotel is nearby touring busstop and a mall. 

Wi-Fi works good in de wifi area. 

Bathroom is ok. 
 good for use. 
 it has warm water. 

Friendly and helpful staff. 

We had a nice stay. 




The worst hotel experience ever. 

The reception has no information about the online booking. 
 They still follow paper and register systems. 
 I took 2 AC rooms and stayed 1 night and half day. 

Hotel's atmosphere is really bad. 
 Poorly maintained rooms and amenities. 
 Air Conditioner in my room is making loud noise while working. 
 When I demanded another room due.

 Stayed there two days. 
But they charged me Rs 1000+ for extra one person because my 16 year old daughter with us. 
 And also Without providing extra bed they charged me 1000+ for extra bed. 
 They didn't informed us about the extra charges before hand when we checked it. 
 I will never stay in this.

The Hotel situation is very prominent in heart of city. 
The Ambiance is also good. 
 its food were very good. 
And not to forget its Staff they were very friendly & helpful. 
The rooms are not updated as per todaY's standard. 
a big let down. 




The only good thing about this hotel is the location. 
 Otherwise right from the reception to the quality of rooms to the food spread is bad when compared to the tariff. 
 The breakfast spread is lousy best described. 
 Unless location is the topmost priority on your list look at avoiding this hote. 




We had stayed at this hotel some twenty years ago when it was brand new and wanted to see if it was as good as before. 
 The owners seem to have let it go to seed. 
 The room was very stuffy and smelled stale. 
 The mattresses were hard as rock. 
 the bedsheets and towels a grey colour. 
 The hot water.

Location is top notch. 
 infront of city central mall. 
 next to Ideal Ice cream parlour and next to Car street. 

Room size is good. 
 and quite clean. 
 Recommend it only for family outings. 

It has NO wifi in rooms. 
 or no internet in rooms. 
 A big negative. 
 So business people. 
 just stay away. 

Room service is good enough and food.

 On arriving at the hotel. 
 the receptionists didn't seem to have a record for online bookings at all. 
 There were 10-15 people waiting at the reception who had made online bookings here . 
 the hotel was unable to find their records.

check-in and check-out experience was very bad. 
 Hotel management need to be educated about online booking through clear trip. 
 They were asking about invoice which was not needed. 

Hotel is ok and good for business trip (based on location). 




We checked out last night. 
one of the best stays I have ever had due to the best manager I have come across in recent times who made our entire stay a pleasant one. 
despite being busy he catered to all our needs and made our stay really comfortable. 
. 
will definitely visit again since the manager told us their renovating and getting even.

It was a terrible place to stay. 
 The lifts were not working. 
 rooms were dirty. 
 no waiters in their restaurant to serve food. 
 Also they took a while to provide the room keys. 
 In single word please avoid



I believe most everyone looks forward to have a good sleep after a hard day. 
 Then. 
 if a situation arises in the. 
 Hotel that's unacceptable or unpleasant you do your best to rectify it and expect some satisfaction from staff to fix the problem 
On such an occasion in Manglore hotel I met the manager. 
 Who went all the way.

Confused&quot. 
 is the most apt description I can provide for this hotel. 
 Mis-communication is in their bloodlines. 
 and they ensure they provide as many hassles as possible for customers.

The location is very strategic. 
 it is absolutely on the heart of the city. 
 All shopping places are quite close by. 
 Rooms are of average standard at least till the executive rooms. 
 Breakfast menu is basic. 
 Folks are fine. 
 If you are looking for one or two night stay either on business trip or on personal trip. 
 you can chose.

the hotel is very very bad no response from the staff no hot water in the morning the gernal manager is use less person to attend the compliants. 
 the charges are high . 
at the time of booking is one rate after you checked in they charge you another rate. 




the location of the hotel is great. 
 right in the midst of city. 
 it is near to milagres church. 
 railway station etc. 
 . 
 the rooms are well maintained. 
 the front office staff were friendly. 
 the food was fine. 
 i do have an opinion that their service need to be more upmarket. 
 other than that i felt great stay at poonja



We had stayed here twice. 
 The rooms were quite big. 
 But the bathrooms were not well maintained. 
 It was clean . 
 the tiles were dirty and broken at some places. 
 The cutlery at the restaurant was not clean. 
 The breakfast menu had only bread-. 
ter-jam and upma. 
 Room service was also not great as we had to call twice. 
thrice for hot.

Hotel was decent . 
 we booked a standard AC room and was neat and clean. 
 The bathroom was ok. 
 . 
 over all there was no reason for us to complain. 
 The Breakfast was pretty standard with no variety at all. 
 . 
 thats complimentary. 
 so thats fine



We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights prebooked over internet after going through reviews. 
 got a decent rate and upon arrival very much found to be as per our expectations. 
 The hotel is centrally located in the city and our check-in has been very smooth and courteous. 
 The room was cosy. 
clean and comfortable with basic amneties provided like tea.

The hotel is equi-distant to most of hot spot in mangalore. 

The service is good. 

The rooms are clean and neat. 

The service they provide could have been little more decent. 

Overall it was a pleasent experience. 




I went to Mangalore for a weekend trip with my family and booked a room at this place via cleartrip. 
 When i reached there. 
 the hotel staff told that they are out of rooms and they cannot give us room in spite of our booking and told us to talk to cleartrip. 
 I tried calling cleartrip 10-15 times . 
 everytime.

Avoid this hotel like the plague. 

Though this hotel is located near city centre mall and railway station. 
 there is absolutely no plus except the location and food. 
 We did not try the complimentary breakfast though. 

Stayed here around 15 years ago and the management does not seem to have spend a cent since then. 
 Bathroom is absolutely useless with.

We arrived in mangalore with a day to spare before our train. 
 After looking around we checked into this hotel. 

Its clean. 
 affordable and situated in the center of the city. 
 The city center mall and the railway station is just 2 min away. 




Recently stayed in a double room. 
The room was good. 
 But the breakfast served was of very low quality (charged separately) in an ordinary hall. 
 No good items were available (though the Menu showed too many. 
). 
 The bill showed Idli . 
 Vada which were actually not served with an explanation that the total amount remains the same though the entry was.

This is just a very ordinary hotel and must say that at the most can be rated as a two star hotel. 
 Small rooms and bathrooms and did not look very clean either. 
 Need a real make over. 
 Room service was very expensive and the service was really poor. 
 And the complimentary breakfast was a disaster.

 Horrible 2 day stay. 
 The reception was poor. 
 The rooms offered was full of bad odor. 
 I changed the room. 
 Very low level AC maintenance. 
 And ACs installed are like ages old. 
 What can I say about the food? Horrible is such an under statement. 
 I ate at KFC near to that hotel.

The one strength of this hotel is it's location near the station. 
 Otherwise it's exactly what you'd expect from a reasonably priced city hotel - clean bed and hot water. 
 with a little wear and tear here and there.

Good place for a one night stay.

I went with my family to mangalore for vacation. 
 we stayed at poonja international as we thought it was a good hotel by trip advisor's rating. 
 But trust me it is THE WORST hotel ever I saw. 
 Onli one lift was working and all the hotel staffs were using it. 
 Everytime we climbed up the stairs. 
 Food was really bad.

our stay in hotel Poonja international not to the mark as the rooms maintenance is poor. 

The toilet not clean and the bed side lamp broken & not working. 

The staff not courteous and the service not to the mark. 

Over all not a good experience. 




service-average
room-although of reasonable standard. 
this hotel is past its glory. 
Needs some re-innovation and updating
location-ideal location in Mangalore. 
this is what i liked best about this hotel. 

charges-little overpriced for its overall services and amenities. 
this is i liked least



I have been staying in Poonja international for past couple of years. 
 Its a very nice place and the ambiance is good. 
 The staff are also very accomodative. 

Needs upgrade on Toilets and the breakfast time needs to be changed from 8am to either 6 to 7. 

Over all a decent place in city centre. 




Located in the heart of the city. 
 Rooms are okay. 
 The hotel is pretty old. 
 needs some renovation. 
 Service could be better. 
 It has 24 hours check-in. 
 that's a plus. 
 Food items are costlier. 
 Overall - less value for money. 




The only good thing about this hotel is its location. 
 Everything else is below standard compared to their competition. 
 Hotel staff. 
 food. 
 room . 
 you name it. 
 it is below standard. 
 Don't go to this hotel. 




As I had no internet access I had to book a room over the telephone. 
 The staff member was not very helpful and kept trying to refer me to a website even though I did explain I could not use internet at the time. 
 Eventually I managed to make a booking and was quoted a price inclusive of tax. 
 When.

We stayed at this hotel recently. 
The rates are very high for the quality maintained by them. 
It is very strange that they do not have even a tubelight in the A. 
C room. 
What they have in the room is just a dim light( which is generally used as a bed light). 
The bed sheets are very shabby. 
untidy. 
The towels are in very worst condition.

Stayed here on 17th March 2014. 
 All old no proper maintenance.

 none at night. 
 The bed was comfortable. 
 It was quiet on the sixth floor. 
 The complimentary Canadian breakfast was adequate with boiled eggs. 
 toast and coffee. 
 The restaurant was not that good . 
 the front desk service was very helpful. 
 For the price. 
 it was average. 




I checked in early morning at 6:00 AM though had booked from 12:00 noon. 
 They did not make any fuss about it and also provided the complimentary breakfast coupon. 
 Hotel is old . 
 reasonable clean. 
 I booked a deluxe AC room so it was okay. 
 I had a good sleep. 
 Next day i overstayed and checked out at 9 PM.

The hotel is located very centrally in mangalore close to railway station and bus stand. 
 However. 
 it is not worth the price they charge. 
 The room had damp walls and at night someone tried to open my door. 
 Could be a mistaken guest though. 
 There was staff talking all loudly in the corridor all night atleast till I was awake.

We stayed at Mangalore as part of wedding ceremony. 
 The hotel is reasonably priced. 
 Very basic hotel with no fancy facilities. 
 The rooms are neat and clean with basic amenities. 
 Like any other small town hotel. 
 better to carry your own toiletries and towels. 
 Free Wifi is available in lobby . 
 not in rooms. 
 A simple south Indian breakfast is.

Great location. 
 Very close to the railway station. 
 Can get noisy sometimes though. 
 Surroundings are clean. 
 The room is just average. 
 Had taken the executive ac . 
 it wasnt the standard I had expected. 
 Breakfast was good. 
 The staff was very polite and provided excellent service. 
 Thanks to the GM Mr. 
 Mangesh



The Hotel is centrally location and is in a busy junction. 
 very convenient from that point of view. 
 The Room and facilities are so so only. 
 and nothing great. 
 the reception and the exteriors really look good. 
 and the same do not reflect in the rooms. 
 I can say the quality of maintenance and cleanliness in the room is very.

As our Mangalore trip was planned at a very short notice - this was the only hotel that had rooms available. 
 Pros first - great location and the staff there are very helpful and knowledgeable and arrange for tours (cabs) without charging extra. 
 They have WiFi in the lobby and rooms with single beds which is great if you are.

My partner and I stayed from the 31st Dec and left late on New Years Day. 
 As another reviewer note the New Years party was underwhelming. 
 though this may largely have to do with Mangalore's strict alcohol piercing laws. 
 especially during NYs. 
 The PA system used for party music was not great as it couldn't handle any bass.

 booked it through makemytrip .

Don't ever pay 4000 for these executive ac rooms. 
 Ac is broken age old and unsafe wirings. 
 Please dont stay in this hotel. 
 Nobody cares about compliment breakfast as the quality and service is very poor. 
 They don't know what customers have during breakfast



Actually I checked in to this hotel in December 2013 since the other hotels in the vicinity were full. 
 I travelled solo and had booked a single Non-AC (Economy) room by e-mail and later also called up to confirm room availability. 
 The room cost Rs. 
 1200 and with tax it was Rs.

The cost shown in the website is very high compared with the actual cost at the Hotel. 
 hereafter i dont want to go with GOIBIBO or with any other sight. 
 better to contact the hotel directly by using the hotel information. 




The reception. 
 room quality. 
 maintenance etc. 
. 
 was good and there was value
for the money I spent. 
 Only one thing is that the food quality (breakfast was good) could be
improved and the food cost can be little tuned. 
 Right now. 
 I felt it is very costly. 
 (Especially dinner). 

Another point to make is non-availability of faucet at the toilet.

 even if it is 23 years old. 
they maintained it very well. 
 They have restarent also.

 it was little expensive. 
 we had our dinner on 10th. 




The hotel which is nearer to station with courteous front staff who responds to your e mail immediately needs to be appreciated. 
 The lounge and restaurant are maintained well . 
 rooms especially stained bed covers and not well maintained bath needs immediate attention. 
 The running hot water is a question here.

This is one of the old hotels in Mangalore. 
 The hotel is situated in the heart of the Mangalore city. 
 I stayed in an executive deluxe room and my first impression was that the room definitely needed a makeover. 

The room had a queen size bed. 
 floor tails were old and discoloured. 
 The cupboard had only half a feet space.

The first impression for me was that of a normal hotel. 

I stayed for 2 nights to cover mangalore as well as udupi. 

The room was spacious and clean. 

The breakfast has variety. 
 You also get the newspaper everyday. 

The hotel has in-house restaurant as well as a pub. 

So you can have a great time in the hotel itself.
